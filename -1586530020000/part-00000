The song reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], behind [[Westlife]]'s single \"[[Swear It Again]]\" for one week. It was voted by ''[[Mixmag]]'' readers as the tenth-greatest dance record of all time.<ref>[http://mixmag.net/words/news/what-is-the-greatest-dance-track-of-all-time What is the Greatest Dance Track of All Time?] ''[[Mixmag]]'' (15 February 2013).</ref>\n\nThe song has been remade by a British DJ and record producer, ATFC, with collaboration with Onephatdeeva in a hit-single that reached up to number 11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], \"In and Out of my Life\" with  vocals by [[Adeva]].\n\n==Composition==\nThe basic string melody of the song was sampled from the [[James Gang]] song \"Ashes, the Rain & I\".

The beginning of the music video is set \"350 billion years ago\", and starts with a single celled [[eukaryote]] in the ocean evolving into a [[jellyfish]], a [[pufferfish]], and then a predatory fish. It manages to eat a smaller fish before leaping up onto dry land. With a [[dinosaur]] visible in the background and an insect in front, it stays still for a few seconds before setting off and eating the insect. The land-fish evolves into a small [[alligator]] as it enters a forest. It sees a tall tree, which it climbs up.  Its body is obscured by the tree as its hands visibly evolve until it arrives at the top as a [[baboon]]-like [[ape]]. It jumps from the tree into an icy landscape, enduring a [[blizzard]] as it evolves into a larger, [[gorilla]]-like ape. At the end of a large cliff, the ape beats its chest as the camera zooms out to show a vast desert. The ape jumps onto the ground, where it has evolved into a primate resembling an [[homo erectus]]. A large storm blows away much of its hair, turning it into a [[human]] (at this point the timer at the bottom right slows dramatically). The human runs faster and puts on some [[trousers]] and a T-[[shirt]] with the logo \"I'm #1 so why try harder\". When fully clothed, it turns into a modern human with a beard. The man walks through a city environment and eats a [[hamburger]] (taken from a cardboard cutout of Fatboy Slim himself), he pulls off the beard and morphs into the obese character depicted on the cover of the album. He finally sits down on a bench at night, at which point the video ends.\n\n==Track listing==\n===UK 12\"===\n# \"Right Here, Right Now\"\n# \"Don't Forget Your Teeth\"\n# \"[[Praise You]]\" (original

It carries [[National Highway 66 (India)|NH 66]] over the tidal part of the Mandovi River. It has a total length of '''5.1 kilometers'''. It is the third longest cable-stayed bridge in India. '''Two Wheelers, Three Wheelers and Bullock Carts''' are strictly prohibited from using the Atal Setu <ref name=\":0\" /> Due to its height '''(30m)'''. Opened on '''5th February 2019'''.\n\n== History ==\nThe Mandovi bridge is one of the most famous and longest bridges in Goa. Before the bridge was built, the ferry was the main mode of transport across River Mandovi in 1970s between Panaji and [[Betim]] village. Due to heavy traffic the first bridge was built in the 1970s. Later in 1986 the first bridge collapsed and was later rebuilt. The second bridge was constructed in 1998 in order to accommodate heavy transport vehicles. The third bridge began construction in 2014. The reason for the third cable-stayed bridge is to accommodate heavy traffic especially during the peak year end tourist season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-bridges-necessary-to-handle-year-end-tourist-traffic-says-cm/articleshow/62273768.cms|title=New bridges necessary to handle year-end tourist traffic, says CM - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref> The bridge was inaugurated on 27 January 2019.\n\n== Construction ==\nOn 14 June 2014, the foundation stone for the third Mandovi bridge was laid by [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]].

He was able to secure one to the [[University of Michigan]], but it was good for only one year.

Since that course would not begin for six months, Worden spent the time at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] Instrument Pilots Instructor School.

Believing, as it proved correctly, that the Air Force program would never get off the ground, Worden chose to apply only to NASA, which he did in September 1965.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\nThe number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year. An estimate 150 yachts are built year on year, and about 90% of these are motoryachts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/motor|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>. Today we count about 5,500 motor yachts. \n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Luxury yacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\nThe number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year. An estimate 150 yachts are built year on year, and about 90% of these are motoryachts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/motor|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>. Today we count about 5,500 motor yachts. \n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Luxury yacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements....

In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy,\" until he instantaneously dozed off.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<ref>Webster 1993, p. 246.</ref>\n\nThough the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince traveled between planets, he purposefully did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a master of the French language, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young [[Northport, New York|Northport]] English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\") related her experiences with her famous student as ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir'', published in 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5cAAAAMAAJ|title=Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942-1943: a memoir|last=Breaux|first=Ad\u00e8le|date=June 1971|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838676103}}</ref>\n\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' (original French: {{lang|fr|Terre des hommes}}).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 02:45&nbsp;am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=258}} They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a ''raid'', that had a prize of 150,000&nbsp;[[francs]].<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" /> Their plane was a [[Caudron]] [[Caudron Simoun|C-630 Simoun]],{{refn|\n\nThe plane Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a [[Caudron]] C-630 [[Caudron Simoun|Simoun]], Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY).\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} and the crash site is thought to have been near to the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] valley, close to the [[Nile Delta]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=263}}\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.<ref name=\"Science and Diplomacy.\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=22 June 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}</ref> Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it.

Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n=== Prince ===\n[[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] may have drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him ''le Roi-Soleil'' (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent [[Gaullism|French Gaullist]] and [[Vichy France]].<ref>Webster 1993, pp. 238\u2013242.</ref> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" />\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on [[Central Park South]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1989-05-12\" /> then the [[Delamater-Bevin Mansion|Bevin House]] mansion in [[Asharoken, New York]], and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=380}}<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />\n\nThe couple also stayed in [[Quebec]] for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.<ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Hannibal\" /><ref name=\"Chesterton\" /><ref name=\"QuebecVille\" /> During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]].{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]]. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P. L. Travers]], the author of the popular children's books series on ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'', was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as ''The Little Prince''. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n\n|group=\"Note\"|}} The author wrote and illustrated ''The Little Prince'' at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006b\" />\n\n[[File:BevinFront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bevin House]] on [[Long Island]], one of the locations in which ''The Little Prince'' was written during the summer and fall of 1942.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />]]\n\nAlthough the book was started in his [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in [[Westport, Connecticut]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked [[Long Island Sound]].

One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour [[Denis de Rougemont]], who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, ''The Tale of the Rose'', as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Manuscript ===\n\nThe original 140-page [[manuscript|autograph manuscript]] of ''The Little Prince'', along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now [[The Morgan Library & Museum]]) in [[Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.09\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.17\" /> It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was [[Strikethrough|struck-through]] and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" />\n\nThe story's keynote [[aphorism]], {{lang|fr|On ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance|lost in action]] during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of [[Corsica]] to [[Continental Europe|the continent]] in preparation for the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied invasion of occupied France]], only three weeks before the [[Liberation of Paris]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />{{refn|\n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\"  Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1943.04.06\" /> Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of ''The New York Times'', stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit.

As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"<ref name=\"Danuscript.a\" />\n\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1955.07.10\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1941.01.19\" /> Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" /> The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy,\" until he instantaneously dozed off.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<ref>Webster 1993, p. 246.</ref>\n\nThough the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince traveled between planets, he purposefully did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a master of the French language, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young [[Northport, New York|Northport]] English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\") related her experiences with her famous student as ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir'', published in 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5cAAAAMAAJ|title=Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942-1943: a memoir|last=Breaux|first=Ad\u00e8le|date=June 1971|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838676103}}</ref>\n\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' (original French: {{lang|fr|Terre des hommes}}).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 02:45&nbsp;am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=258}} They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a ''raid'', that had a prize of 150,000&nbsp;[[francs]].<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" /> Their plane was a [[Caudron]] [[Caudron Simoun|C-630 Simoun]],{{refn|\n\nThe plane Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a [[Caudron]] C-630 [[Caudron Simoun|Simoun]], Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY).\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} and the crash site is thought to have been near to the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] valley, close to the [[Nile Delta]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=263}}\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.<ref name=\"Science and Diplomacy.\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=22 June 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}</ref> Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".<ref name=\"AirmansOdyssey\" />\n\n=== Rose ===\n[[File:Consuelo en 1942 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.jpg|thumb|right| 200px |The Rose in ''The Little Prince'' was likely inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo (Montreal, 1942).]]\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted but petulant and vain rose was inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's [[Salvadoran]] wife [[Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=248\u2013251}} with the small home planet being inspired by her small native country, [[El Salvador]], also known as \"The Land of Volcanoes.\"{{sfnp|Saint Exup\u00e9ry, Consuelo de|2003}} Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n=== Prince ===\n[[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] may have drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him ''le Roi-Soleil'' (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).]]\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, he initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> After France's defeat in 1940 and its [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany]], he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis forces]], and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the [[French Resistance]]. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent [[Gaullism|French Gaullist]] and [[Vichy France]].<ref>Webster 1993, pp. 238\u2013242.</ref> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" />\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on [[Central Park South]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1989-05-12\" /> then the [[Delamater-Bevin Mansion|Bevin House]] mansion in [[Asharoken, New York]], and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=380}}<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />\n\nThe couple also stayed in [[Quebec]] for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.<ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Hannibal\" /><ref name=\"Chesterton\" /><ref name=\"QuebecVille\" /> During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]].{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]]. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P. L. Travers]], the author of the popular children's books series on ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'', was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as ''The Little Prince''. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n\n|group=\"Note\"|}} The author wrote and illustrated ''The Little Prince'' at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006b\" />\n\n[[File:BevinFront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bevin House]] on [[Long Island]], one of the locations in which ''The Little Prince'' was written during the summer and fall of 1942.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />]]\n\nAlthough the book was started in his [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations.

One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour [[Denis de Rougemont]], who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, ''The Tale of the Rose'', as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died.

In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage.

L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance|lost in action]] during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of [[Corsica]] to [[Continental Europe|the continent]] in preparation for the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied invasion of occupied France]], only three weeks before the [[Liberation of Paris]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />{{refn|\n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\"  Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1943.04.06\" /> Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of ''The New York Times'', stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of [[credo]].\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> [[P. L. Travers|P.L. Travers]], author of the [[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]] series of children books, wrote in a ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' review: \"''The Little Prince'' will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.b\" />\n\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"\u2026bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"<ref name=\"American Conservative-2009.10\" />\n\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for only two weeks,<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" /> as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' which remained on the same list for nearly five months.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning [[List of The Little Prince adaptations|numerous adaptations]].

It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like [[Mayan languages|Maya]] (2001), [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (2006) or [[Banat Bulgarian dialect|Banat Bulgarian]] (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into [[Latin]], as ''Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt''<ref name=\"Hinke-Quand\" /><ref name=\"LA Times-1993.09.29\" /> in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910\u20132002) and as ''Regulus'' in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. In 2005, the book was also translated into [[Toba Qom language|Toba Qom]], an indigenous language of northern [[Argentina]], as ''So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a''. It was the first book translated into that language since the [[New Testament]]. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, [[Vogherese]]. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".<ref name=\"Le Monde-2005.04.06\" />\n\n[[Linguist]]s have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy.

The genus is named after [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli|Giovanni Scopoli]] (1723\u201388), a [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]ean [[Natural history|naturalist]].\nThe genus has a disjunct distribution, with two recognised species in [[Central Europe|Central]] to [[Eastern Europe]], (including the [[Caucasus]]), and two species in [[East Asia]].\nThe two European species are:\n*''[[Scopolia carniolica]]'' <small>Jacq.</small> of [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]\n*''[[Scopolia caucasica]]'' <small>Kolesn. ex Kreyer</small> of the [[Caucasus]]\nand the two Asiatic species are:\n*''[[Scopolia lutescens]]'' <small>Y.N.
