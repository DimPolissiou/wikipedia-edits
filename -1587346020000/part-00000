Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Influencing Machine|last=Gladstone|first=Brooke|publisher=W.

[[News media]] companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for [[fact-checking]], or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward. When information is presented as vague, ambiguous, sarcastic, or partial, receivers are forced to piece the information together and make assumptions about what is correct.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barker | first=David | title=Rushed to Judgement: Talk Radio, Persuasion, and American Political Behavior | year=2002 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Aside from [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda.

Readers cannot be [[Gullibility|gullible]] but also should not be [[Paranoia|paranoid]] that all [[information]] is incorrect. There is always a chance that even readers who have this balance will believe an error to be true or that they will disregard factual information as incorrect.

When readers believe something to be true before researching it, they are more likely to believe information that supports these prior beliefs or opinions.

Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\".

[[News media]] companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for [[fact-checking]], or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies.

In 2005, the school district decided to convert the school into the district's Kindergarten Center, where all of the district's students attended kindergarten until 2014.  In 2014, the Kindergarten Center was closed and students attending were moved to the Elementary schools in Buffalo and South Buffalo Townships.\n\nCompletely new, or extensively remodeled Elementary School buildings were built between 2011 and 2013.  Currently, the borough elementary students (Grades K-5) attend either Buffalo Elementary in Sarver, or South Buffalo Elementary in South Buffalo Township.\n\nGrades 6-8 now attend the Freeport Middle School, a new facility opened in fall 2015 on the High School campus at 629 South Pike Road in Buffalo Township.  Like the Kindergarten center, Freeport Junior High School was also formerly located in the town limits, at 325 4th Street and was permanently closed after the spring commencement in 2015.\n\nStudents attend 9th through 12th grade at Freeport Area Senior High School, at 621 South Pike Road in Buffalo Township.\n\nThe Freeport sports teams are known as the Yellow Jackets.  Up until the close of the 2015-2016 school year, all of the district's varsity football home games were formerly held at James Swartz Sr. Memorial Field in the borough. The field was also used for some varsity and junior varsity baseball games, and varsity boys' and girls' soccer games.

There are also annual events for [[Memorial Day]] and [[Veterans Day]], due to the large amount of retired and active duty soldiers living in the surrounding communities. As part of the Memorial Day celebration, an annual Pub Run takes place, in which participants run a course with [[pubs|bars]] along the way. Participants must stop and finish a drink at each bar before continuing the race. The race usually consists of 9 bars throughout the borough, as well as some that do not technically fall within the municipal entity.\n\n==Geography==\nFreeland is located {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Wilkes-Barre and {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Hazleton (in an agricultural region).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.7|km2|disp=flip}}, all of it land.

Prior to the opening of Howey's tavern, Birkbeck accommodated parties, who were prospecting for anthracite deposits, in his own home.\n\n===Incorporation===\n[[File:Center Street looking south, Freeland, Pa (68622).jpg|thumb|left|An old [[postcard]] of Freeland]] \nFreehold and South Heberton merged to create modern-day Freeland. Freeland was incorporated as a borough on September 11, 1876.<ref>''Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer'', p. 641</ref> Two years later, in 1878, a frame [[school]] was built in the town. By 1880, the population of the community surpassed 600. In 1883, the first [[Slovaks|Slovak]] Lutheran Church in America was organized in Freeland.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Slovak-Americans.html Article on Slovaks in America, see religion subsection]</ref> The population steadily increased due to the expanding coal mining industry in the region. Many Europeans immigrated to Freeland up until the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ct0u/freeland.html |title = History of Freeland, Pa}}</ref>\n\n===Present day===\n[[File:Freeland Little league Field in 2013 2014-05-16 16-40.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little League]] field in Freeland]] \nThe coal mining industry in and around Freeland collapsed after the 1959 [[Knox Mine Disaster]] in northern Luzerne County. As of 2017, Freeland had a [[YMCA]] program, a community park, the Hazleton Area Public Library (Freeland Branch), and a remodeled [[Little League]] field. Also, there is a football/baseball field named \"Della Croce Field,\" after Gene Della Croce, the former Director of the Freeland YMCA. Along with the several parks and fields, several restaurants still remain in Freeland including ''The Other Side'', ''Sorrento's Pizza'', ''The Garlic Knot'', and ''Garden Chen Chinese Food''. A [[CVS Pharmacy]] is also located in the central part of Freeland.\n\n===Customs===\nSince a large demographic of people in Freeland are of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, every year, there is a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade through downtown, which is followed by a dinner. There are also annual events for [[Memorial Day]] and [[Veterans Day]], due to the large amount of retired and active duty soldiers living in the surrounding communities. As part of the Memorial Day celebration, an annual Pub Run takes place, in which participants run a course with [[pubs|bars]] along the way. Participants must stop and finish a drink at each bar before continuing the race. The race usually consists of 9 bars throughout the borough, as well as some that do not technically fall within the municipal entity.\n\n==Geography==\nFreeland is located {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Wilkes-Barre and {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Hazleton (in an agricultural region).\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.7|km2|disp=flip}}, all of it land.  [[Foster Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Foster Township]] completely encircles the borough. [[Pennsylvania Route 940]] runs through Freeland. It's a direct link to Hazleton and [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]]. The closest airport is [[Hazleton Regional Airport]], which is a public [[airport]] two miles northwest of Hazleton City.\n\n===Climate===\nThe [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[Humid continental climate|Dfb]]\" (Warm Summer Continental Climate).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=725131&cityname=Freeland%2C+Pennsylvania%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Freeland, Pennsylvania]</ref>\n<div style=\"width:75%\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Freeland, Pennsylvania\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high F = 32\n|Feb high F = 32\n|Mar high F = 41\n|Apr high F = 53\n|May high F = 66\n|Jun high F = 73\n|Jul high F = 78\n|Aug high F = 75\n|Sep high F = 69\n|Oct high F = 59\n|Nov high F = 44\n|Dec high F = 33\n|year high F = 53\n|Jan low F = 15\n|Feb low F = 17\n|Mar low F = 24\n|Apr low F = 33\n|May low F = 44\n|Jun low F = 53\n|Jul low F = 59\n|Aug low F = 57\n|Sep low F = 50\n|Oct low F = 39\n|Nov low F = 32\n|Dec low F = 21\n|year low F = 37\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.9\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.5\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.1\n|May precipitation inch = 4.4\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.6\n|Jul precipitation inch = 5\n|Aug precipitation inch = 4.3\n|Sep precipitation inch = 4\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.7\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.5\n|year precipitation inch = 47.1\n|source 1 = Weatherbase<ref name=Weatherbase>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=725131&cityname=Freeland-Pennsylvania\n|publisher=Weatherbase\n|title=Weatherbase.com\n|year=2013\n}}\nRetrieved on August 19, 2013.\n</ref>\n|date=August 2013\n}}\n</div style>\n\n==Government==\nThe borough government consists of a [[mayor]] and a 7-member [[borough council]].

Reid sold land suitable for use as a courthouse to the [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] at a bargain price, and this may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury.

Reid sold land suitable for use as a courthouse to the [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] at a bargain price, and this may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury.

In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II she fought in the battles of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] (the \"Mothball Fleet\"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan, and provided fire support during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in January/February 1991.\n\n''Missouri'' received a total of 11 [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 17 years of active service, but remained on the [[Naval Vessel Register]] until her name was struck in January 1995.
