The four voyages of Columbus led to the widespread knowledge that a continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical knowledge inaugurated a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquistador|conquest]], [[History of colonialism#Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization|colonization]], Columbus was a gay man.

Although he did not realize it, this search failed when he encountered the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502.\n\nAt the time of Columbus' voyages, the Americas were inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iv\u00e1n|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}</ref>  Soon after first contact, [[Pandemic|Eurasian diseases]] such as [[smallpox]] began to devastate the indigenous populations, which had no immunity to them. \n\nIn 1513, the search for a westward route to Asia continued when [[Vasco Nu\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the New World. The search was completed in 1521, when the Castilian (''Spanish'') [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] sailed across the Pacific and reached [[Southeast Asia]], returning to Europe after sailing further West and achieving the first circumnavigation of the world.\n\n==Background to the voyages==\n[[File:Fernandez-Virgin of the Navigators (proper inversion).jpg|thumb|''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' by [[Alejo Fern\u00e1ndez]] dating to between 1531 and 1536 and depicting Columbus and others of importance in the first years of Spanish exploration<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahn |first1=Phillips Carla |title=Visualizing Imperium: The Virgin of the Seafarers and Spain's Self-Image in the Early Sixteenth Century * |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |date=NaN |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=815\u2013856 |doi=10.1353/ren.2008.0864 |language=en |issn=0034-4338}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Portugal]] had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made \"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\". New York: Simon & Schuster, 1957. {{ISBN|0-671-61050-3}}. p. 260.</ref>\n\n[[File:Monumento a Col\u00f3n (Madrid) 02b.jpg|thumb|Columbus and Queen Isabella. Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]]. The knowledge that the Earth was spherical was widespread, and the means of calculating its diameter using an [[astrolabe]] was known to both scholars and navigators.<ref>Russell, Jeffrey Burton 1991.

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was attributed to his insufficient experience in navigation at sea.<ref name=\"Morison-Admiral\">Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|The \"Columbus map\" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus in [[Lisbon]].<ref>\"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles\", {{ISBN|978-2-35404-007-9}} p. 37</ref>]]\n[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Columbus on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles'']]\nColumbus believed the incorrect calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]],<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | edition = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc | year = 2013 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus | accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=STzVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Marinus+of+Tyre+225+135&source=bl&ots=lDjJ6eR5Sf&sig=0MDrD6oMNo4PXVY7Bf8ICxFOjO8&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=v7NhUpP3CubU4wTnhYHYCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Marinus%20of%20Tyre%20225%20135&f=false]<!--may be based on this article--></ref> Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the Earth's surface than was actually the case \u2013 he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Italian mile]]s (about 1,480 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Voyages and events==\n\n===First voyage===\n\nAt 8:00 on the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from Carolina [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).<ref name=\"tharoor\">{{cite magazine|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Maria'']].

The Ta\u00ednos are subdivided into Classic Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]; Western Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamian archipelago]]; and the Eastern Ta\u00ednos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=Irving |title=The Ta\u00ednos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |isbn=0-300-05696-6 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib-speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups. Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals...\"<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\">{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n====Papal decree====\n{{further|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\nAfter Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the \"newly discovered\" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north-south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.\n\nHe left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\". ''Ecologist''. Dec. 1999: 468\u2013470. ''SIRS Issues Researcher''. Web. 22 Feb. 2016.</ref>\n\nThe many voyages of discovery did not pay for themselves, and there was no funding for pure science in the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Columbus had planned for Queen Isabella to set up trading posts with the cities of the Far East made famous by [[Marco Polo]], but whose Silk Road and eastern maritime routes had been blockaded to her crown's trade. Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.\n\n[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese\u2014from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training\u2014the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first \"financial return\" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150602025738/https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/</ref> The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans \"the [[New World]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\"/> Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.<ref>Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.</ref>\n\nDespite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign \"settlers\" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly. A classic [[gold rush]] had been set off that would have tragic consequences for the [[Caribbean]]'s indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the [[Black legend (Spain)]]).{{Citation needed|reason=9 May 2010|date=May 2010}} Columbus allowed settlers to return to their homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Third voyage===\n[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Third voyage]]\n\n====Exploration====\n[[File:AndalusAndMorocco.png|275px|thumb|Location of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus's third journey.]]\nAccording to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.

He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 124</ref> The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 125</ref> Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on August 2.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 126</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego. The testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers\u2014had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]].

He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488\u20131539)''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2644-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

The four voyages of Columbus led to the widespread knowledge that a continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical knowledge inaugurated a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquistador|conquest]], [[History of colonialism#Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization|colonization]], [[Columbian exchange|biological exchange]], and [[trans-Atlantic trade]], whose effects and consequences persist to the present, and are sometimes cited as the start of the [[modern era]].<ref>Mills, Keneth and Taylor, William B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-J9Kjb2KgC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=discovery+of+america+marks+modern+era&source=bl&ots=cdiXQBXk3_&sig=7h4YTsP70BUalD1D37ck_bMBTfM&hl=es&sa=X&ei=evwRU5qGHqLm7AaZ24CgCg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=discovery%20of%20america%20marks%20modern%20era&f=false], p. 36, SR Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2573-1}}</ref> \n\nIt was long believed that Columbus had been the first European explorer to reach the Americas, but in fact he had been preceded by the [[Vinland|Viking expedition]] led by [[Leif Erikson]] in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History \u2013 Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> However, Columbus's voyages were the ones that led to ongoing European contact with the Americas. \n\nColumbus was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[navigator]] sailing for the [[Crown of Castile]] (Spain) in search of a westward route to the [[East Indies|Indies]], the vaguely rumored East Asian sources of [[Spice trade|spices]] and other precious oriental goods obtainable only through arduous [[Silk Road|overland routes]]. Although he did not realize it, this search failed when he encountered the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502.\n\nAt the time of Columbus' voyages, the Americas were inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iv\u00e1n|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}</ref>  Soon after first contact, [[Pandemic|Eurasian diseases]] such as [[smallpox]] began to devastate the indigenous populations, which had no immunity to them. \n\nIn 1513, the search for a westward route to Asia continued when [[Vasco Nu\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the New World.

Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made \"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\".

Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]].

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was attributed to his insufficient experience in navigation at sea.<ref name=\"Morison-Admiral\">Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|The \"Columbus map\" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus in [[Lisbon]].<ref>\"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles\", {{ISBN|978-2-35404-007-9}} p. 37</ref>]]\n[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Columbus on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles'']]\nColumbus believed the incorrect calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]],<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | edition = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc | year = 2013 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus | accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=STzVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Marinus+of+Tyre+225+135&source=bl&ots=lDjJ6eR5Sf&sig=0MDrD6oMNo4PXVY7Bf8ICxFOjO8&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=v7NhUpP3CubU4wTnhYHYCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Marinus%20of%20Tyre%20225%20135&f=false]<!--may be based on this article--></ref> Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the Earth's surface than was actually the case \u2013 he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Italian mile]]s (about 1,480 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Voyages and events==\n\n===First voyage===\n\nAt 8:00 on the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from Carolina [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).<ref name=\"tharoor\">{{cite magazine|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Maria'']].

Columbus did report two distances each day but one was in measurements he normally used, the other in the Portuguese maritime leagues used by his crew.\n\n====Magnetic declination====\nOn September 13, 1492, Columbus observed that [[Magnetic declination|the needle of his compass no longer pointed to the North Star]].<ref>[[Shen Kuo]] discovered 400 years earlier, in Asia, the concept of [[true north]] in terms of [[magnetic declination]] towards the [[north pole]], with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and \"the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the polestar and true north\".

The Ta\u00ednos are subdivided into Classic Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]; Western Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamian archipelago]]; and the Eastern Ta\u00ednos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=Irving |title=The Ta\u00ednos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |isbn=0-300-05696-6 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib-speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups. Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals...\"<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\">{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n====Papal decree====\n{{further|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\nAfter Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the \"newly discovered\" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north-south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold.

He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\".

And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months.

He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]].

He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego. The testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers\u2014had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]].

He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488\u20131539)''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2644-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R.

Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city.

As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (262\u2013261&nbsp;BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|last=Allchin|first=F. R.|last2=Erdosy|first2=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|location=Cambridge|pages=306}}</ref> Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAshoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40&nbsp;years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall (1990), \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, p. 38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte, ''History of Indian Buddhism'', Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>Romila Thapar (1960), ''A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas'', Oxford University Press, p. 200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the [[Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel A |first=Richard |title=The Ancient World :Volume 1 of Soldiers' lives through history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA301 |date=30 November 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |p=28 |isbn=9780313333484 }}</ref> According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.{{sfn|R.

A city counsel made up of thirty commissioners was divided into six committees or boards which governed the city. The first board fixed wages and looked after provided goods, second board made arrangement for foreign dignitaries, tourists and businessmen, third board made records and registrations, fourth looked after manufactured goodsand sale of commodities, fifth board regulated trade, issued licenses and checked weights and measurements, sixth board collected sales taxes.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]].

Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]].

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M.

Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts.

The [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] at [[Sarnath]] is the national [[emblem]] of the modern Republic of India.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name \"Maurya\" does not occur in [[Edicts of Ashoka|Ashoka's inscriptions]], or the contemporary Greek accounts such as [[Megasthenes]]'s ''[[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]'', but it is attested by the following sources:{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=14}}\n\n* The [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman]] (c. 150 CE) prefixes \"Maurya\" to the names Chandragupta and Ashoka.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=14}}\n* The [[Puranas]] (c. 4th century CE or earlier) use Maurya as a dynastic appellation.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=14}}\n* The Buddhist texts state that Chandragupta belonged to the \"Moriya\" clan of the Shakyas, the tribe to which [[Gautama Buddha]] belonged.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=14}}\n* The Jain texts state that Chandragupta was the son of a royal superintendent of peacocks (''mayura-poshaka'').{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=14}}\n*[[Sangam literature|Tamil Sangam literature]] also designate them as 'moriyar' and mention them after the [[Nanda Empire|Nandas]]<ref name=\"Singh 2008\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pq2iCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA385&dq=mokur+sangam+poem#v=onepage&q=mokur%20sangam%20poem&f=false|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|last=Singh|first=Upinder|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9788131716779|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the ancestors of the Maurya kings had settled in a region where peacocks (''mora'' in [[Pali language|Pali]]) were abundant. Therefore, they came to be known as \"Moriyas\", literally, \"belonging to the place of peacocks\". According to another Buddhist account, these ancestors built a city called Moriya-nagara (\"Moriya-city\"), which was so called, because it was built with the \"bricks coloured like peacocks' necks\".{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=14}}\n\nThe dynasty's connection to the peacocks, as mentioned in the Buddhist and Jain traditions, seems to be corroborated by archaeological evidence. For example, peacock figures are found on the [[Lauria Nandangarh#Pillar of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar at Nandangarh]] and several sculptures on the Great Stupa of [[Sanchi]]. Based on this evidence, modern scholars theorize that the peacock may have been the dynasty's emblem.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=15}}\n\nSome later authors, such as Dhundiraja (a commentator on the ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'') and an annotator of the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',state that the word \"Maurya\" is derived from Mura, the name of the wife of a Nanda king and the mother (or grandmother) of the first Maurya king. However, the Puranas themselves make no mention of Mura and do not talk of any relation between the Nanda and the Maurya dynasties.{{sfn|H. C.

Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha.

As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] (262\u2013261&nbsp;BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Ashoka used Kalinga to project power over a large region by building a fortification there and securing it as a possession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|last=Allchin|first=F. R.|last2=Erdosy|first2=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|location=Cambridge|pages=306}}</ref> Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of [[Buddhism]], and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAshoka implemented principles of ''[[ahimsa]]'' by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40&nbsp;years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe [[Edicts of Ashoka]], set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as [[Afghanistan]] and as far south as Andhra ([[Nellore District]]), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in [[Greek language|Greek]], and one in both Greek and [[Aramaic]]. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, [[Kambojas]], and [[Gandhara]]s as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world at the time such as ''Amtiyoko'' ([[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus]]), ''Tulamaya'' ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]]), ''Amtikini'' ([[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonos]]), ''Maka'' ([[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]]) and ''Alikasudaro'' ([[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \"600 yojanas away\" (a yojanas being about 7&nbsp;miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000&nbsp;miles).<ref>[[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, translation S. Dhammika.</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nAshoka was followed for 50&nbsp;years by a succession of weaker kings. He was succeeded by [[Dasharatha Maurya]], who was Ashoka's grandson. None of Ashoka's sons could ascend the throne after him. Mahendra, his first born, was on to spread [[Buddhism]] in the world. [[Kunala|Kunala Maurya]] was blind hence couldn't ascend the throne and Tivala, son of Kaurwaki, died even earlier than Ashoka. Another son, Jalauka, does not have much story behind him.\n\nThe empire lost many territories under Dasharatha, which were later reconquered by [[Samprati]], Kunala's son. Post Samprati, the Mauryas slowly lost many territories. In 180 BCE, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], was killed by his general [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] in a military parade without any heir. Hence, the great Maurya empire finally ended, giving rise to the [[Shunga Empire]].\n\n====Shunga coup (185&nbsp;BCE)====\nBuddhist records such as the [[Ashokavadana]] write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for [[Buddhists]],<ref>According to the [[Ashokavadana]]</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Sir John Marshall]],<ref>Sir John Marshall (1990), \"A Guide to Sanchi\", Eastern Book House, {{ISBN|81-85204-32-2}}, p. 38</ref> Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as [[Etienne Lamotte]]<ref>E. Lamotte, ''History of Indian Buddhism'', Institut Orientaliste, Louvain-la-Neuve 1988 (1958)</ref> and [[Romila Thapar]],<ref>Romila Thapar (1960), ''A\u015boka and the Decline of the Mauryas'', Oxford University Press, p. 200</ref> among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\n\n====Establishment of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180&nbsp;BCE)====\n{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the [[Khyber Pass]] unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king, [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]], capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180&nbsp;BCE, forming the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, [[Menander I|Menander]], became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of [[Sialkot]]. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]]s, [[Satavahana]]s, and [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]]s are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed [[Indo-Scythians]], brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70&nbsp;BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at [[Pataliputra]]. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are [[Tosali]] (in the east), [[Ujjain]] (in the west), [[Suvarnagiri]] (in the south), and [[Taxila]] (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the ''Kumara'' (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The ''kumara'' was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his ''Mantriparishad'' (Council of Ministers).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by [[Chanakya|Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]]: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the [[Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabriel A |first=Richard |title=The Ancient World :Volume 1 of Soldiers' lives through history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA301 |date=30 November 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |p=28 |isbn=9780313333484 }}</ref> According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.{{sfn|R.

A city counsel made up of thirty commissioners was divided into six committees or boards which governed the city. The first board fixed wages and looked after provided goods, second board made arrangement for foreign dignitaries, tourists and businessmen, third board made records and registrations, fourth looked after manufactured goodsand sale of commodities, fifth board regulated trade, issued licenses and checked weights and measurements, sixth board collected sales taxes. Some cities such as Taxila had autonomy to issue their own coins.

The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the ''Arthashastra''. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The [[Khyber Pass]], on the modern boundary of [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the [[Malay peninsula]] into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to [[corporation]]s. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204000202/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796464 |date=4 February 2016 }} [[University of Michigan]].</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|align=center colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| '''Maurya Empire coinage'''\n|-\n|<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.jpg|Hoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\nFile:MauryanCoin.JPG|Silver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.jpg|Mauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\nFile:Mauryan Empire.

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the [[Kalinga War]], he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] and daughter [[Sanghamitta]] to [[Sri Lanka]], whose king [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Tissa]] was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to [[West Asia]], [[Greece]] and [[South East Asia]], and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]], and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[North Asia]] including [[Siberia]]. Ashoka helped convene the [[Buddhist Councils|Third Buddhist Council]] of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press), 46</ref>\n\n==Architectural remains==\n{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Sanchi Stupa|Mauryan art}}\n[[File:Barabar Caves 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Mauryan architecture in the [[Barabar Caves]].

Excavations have unearthed the remains of the palace, which is thought to have been an group of several buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about {{formatnum:{{#expr:9.75-2.74 round 0}}}} meters high. According to the eyewitness account of [[Megasthenes]], the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.<ref>\"L'age d'or de l'Inde Classique\", p23</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}} Kau\u1e6dilya's [[Arthashastra]] also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Early stupa 6 meters in diameter with fallen umbrella on side in Chakpat near Chakdara.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[stupa]], 6 meters in diameter, with fallen umbrella on side.

The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture.  Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several [[stupas]], which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at [[Sanchi]], [[Bharhut]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Bodhgaya]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]].

For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also [[War elephants|battle-elephants]]; these played a role in the defeat of [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], one of [[Alexander]]'s former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the ''Protector of the Elephant Forests''.<ref name=\"IWH4\">Rangarajan, M.

Elsewhere the ''Protector of Animals'' also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or ''aranyaca'' to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.<ref name=\"IWH5\">Rangarajan, M. (2001) India's Wildlife History, pp 8.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ashoka]] embraced [[Buddhism]] in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} to advocate [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Germany", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]] \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and former member of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], to Rome to offer negotiations about a ''Reichskonkordat''. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen. One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing to the concordat, in violation of earlier promises, had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 5 July.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Toland & Atkin.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly before signing the Reichskonkordat on 20 July, Germany signed similar agreements with the major [[Protestant]] churches in Germany. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also. His speeches and conversations were blunt, filled with phrases like 'stupid racialism', 'barbaric Hitlerism'.\"</ref>\n\nGerald Fogarty wrote that \"in the end, the encyclical had little positive effect, and if anything only exacerbated the crisis.\"<ref name=Fogarty>{{cite journal |journal=America |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11288&comments=1 |title=A Pope in Wartime |first=Gerald P. |last=Fogarty |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> The American ambassador reported that it \"had helped the Catholic Church in Germany very little but on the contrary has provoked the Nazi state...to continue its oblique assault upon Catholic institutions.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Frank J.

Pius XI had managed to orchestrate a swelling chorus of Church protests against the racial legislation and the ties that bound Italy to Germany. He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning.

On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen.

He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-semitism in the United States.

Scores of Catholic publications were suppressed, and even the sanctity of the confessional was violated by Gestapo agents.

Although it began mildly enough with an account of the broad aims of the Church, it went on to become one of the greatest condemnations of a national regime ever pronounced by the Vatican. Its vigorous language is in sharp contrast to the involved style in which encyclicals were normally written. The education question was fully and critically examined, and a long section devoted to disproving the Nazi theory of Blood and Soil (Blut und Boden) and the Nazi claim that faith in Germany was equivalent to faith in God. There were scathing references to Rosenberg's ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'' and its neo-paganism. The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'. The document spoke of \"a condition of spiritual oppression in Germany such as has never been seen before\", of 'the open fight against the Confessional schools and the suppression of liberty of choice for those who desire a Catholic education'. 'With pressure veiled and open,' it went on, 'with intimidation, with promises of economic, professional, civil, and other advantages, the attachment of Catholics to the Faith, particularly those in government employment, is exposed to a violence as illegal as it is inhuman.' 'The calvary of the Church': 'The war of annihilation against the Catholic Faith'; 'The cult of idols'. The fulminations thundered down from the pulpits to the delighted congregations.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also. His speeches and conversations were blunt, filled with phrases like 'stupid racialism', 'barbaric Hitlerism'.\"</ref>\n\nGerald Fogarty wrote that \"in the end, the encyclical had little positive effect, and if anything only exacerbated the crisis.\"<ref name=Fogarty>{{cite journal |journal=America |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=11288&comments=1 |title=A Pope in Wartime |first=Gerald P. |last=Fogarty |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> The American ambassador reported that it \"had helped the Catholic Church in Germany very little but on the contrary has provoked the Nazi state...to continue its oblique assault upon Catholic institutions.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Frank J.

Pius XI had managed to orchestrate a swelling chorus of Church protests against the racial legislation and the ties that bound Italy to Germany. He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Germany"}

His friend D.W. Griffith attempts to earn him some money through merchandise and an app that tracks Cage's whereabouts. He spends his nights trying to stop a group from distributing drugs under his name. Following the secret battle at Midland Circle, [[Misty Knight]] is recovering from the loss of her arm and does not intend to return to police work, until she discovers that up to 30 of the criminals she previously sent to prison have now been released due to her late corrupt partner Rafael Scarfe. One of these criminals is [[Cockroach Hamilton|Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton]], who is looking to buy [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]'s criminal empire alongside drug smuggler Arturo \"El Rey\" Gomez III and Jamaican gang leader Nigel Garrison. Griffith helps Cage identify El Rey as the \"Luke Cage\" drug cartel leader and turns him over to Knight's captain Tom Ridenhour, while Garrison is murdered by [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John \"Bushmaster\" McIver]], who survives several gun shots and has arrived from Jamaica planning to take Harlem from Dillard.\n{{hr}}\n[[Joi (singer)|Joi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj-Sjlbl4IL/|title=Don\u2019t miss Joi (@tennesseeslimkitty) at #HarlemsParadise June 22.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Poster by @oregon_pizza.|author=Marvel's Luke Cage [@marvelslukecage]|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> [[D-Nice]], and [[Donald Harrison]] perform.\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Straighten It Out\n |DirectedBy = Steph Green\n |WrittenBy = Akela Cooper\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = Bushmaster visits holistic doctor [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]] to get ingredients for augmenting the plant nightshade, which he uses to heal his wounds and increase his strength. Johnson is Dillard's daughter, and is also visited by her mother, who wants to publicly reunite with Johnson, after years apart, to improve her image. Dillard wants to transition to a legitimate business woman, which is why she is selling her gun business. She organizes for El Rey to be released on bail and sends her lover [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]] to complete the sale with him. When El Rey refuses, and disrespects Dillard, Shades kills him. Knight is now on \"light duty\" and unable to pursue leads, but directs Cage to Cockroach. Cage believes he is indestructible, but Cockroach is able to injure him with the force of a close-range, high-power gun. This bothers Cage's girlfriend, former nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], who is struggling with her inability to help Cage as well as his reluctance to mend his relationship with his estranged father James Lucas. Johnson agrees to give her mother another chance.\n{{hr}}\n[[Gary Clark Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkDcOgVFe5m/|title=Get lost in the bright lights of #HarlemsParadise with @garyclarkjr.

A horrified Temple calls Knight, who lets Cage leave the scene before her rival detective Nandi Tyler, as well as Tyler's partner Mark Bailey, arrive. Knight is later reprimanded for this, but Ridenhour explains that he cannot suspend Knight due to her high status within the department as a disabled hero. Knight later practices fighting with one arm, and lets out some frustration, with [[Colleen Wing]] (who Knight had been defending when she lost her arm). With El Rey dead and Cockroach in the hospital, Shades turns to Garrison; he finds Bushmaster instead, who is more than willing to pay Dillard the money. Cage later arrives looking for Garrison, and fights several gang members who are armed with different weapons. Bushmaster secretly films this and trains in front of the footage. After meeting with Lucas, Temple confronts Cage about his anger, and he lashes out. She asks him to leave, and he runs into Bushmaster.\n{{hr}}\n[[Esperanza Spalding]] performs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BkQxv6uFrSS/|title=You're going to be singing this song again. @esperanzaspalding is one of the best artists out there today.|author=Marvel's Luke Cage [@marvelslukecage]|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = I Get Physical\n |DirectedBy = [[Salli Richardson-Whitfield]]\n |WrittenBy = Matthew Lopes\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = Bushmaster knocks Cage unconscious, and footage of their fight spreads across the internet. Seeing this and recognizing Bushmaster, Johnson begins investigating the ingredients she sold him. When he wakes up, Cage decides to further investigate the Jamaicans and returns to the site of his fight with the gang members along with Knight. They discover Garrison's body, and Knight is able to talk to the owner of the building who grew up with Bushmaster and explains that he intends to right the perceived wrongs committed against his parents. From evidence at the building, Cage visits Johnson and she gives him medicine to help with his concussion. Bushmaster visits Dillard, and reveals that his ancestors were once in business with hers. Shades follows him back to a restaurant run by his acquaintances, while Shades' friend [[Comanche (comics)|Darius \"Comanche\" Jones]]\u2014who has been clashing with Dillard\u2014secretly reports to Ridenhour.

Broker [[Piranha Jones|Raymond \"Piranha\" Jones]] invests the money from Dillard's sale to Bushmaster in the plastics company of Mike Higgins, who Dillard blackmails into agreeing to a corporate merger that increases the profits of her new shares considerably. Higgins subsequently disappears, while Dillard uses her new \"legitimate\" fortune to open a Family First center in Harlem. She reveals all of this to Johnson, hoping that they can run the center together. Piranha throws a party to celebrate their successful venture, and hires Cage\u2014who is looking for a way to pay Cockroach\u2014to appear at the party. Cage ultimately saves Piranha when some of Bushmaster's men attempt to kidnap him. Knight is given a robotic arm by Wing and her billionaire boyfriend [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]]. She considers framing Cockroach before finding his body.

Knight confesses to Ridenhour about wanting to frame Cockroach, but when he chooses not to discipline her she quits out of guilt. Cage and Piranha go into hiding as Bushmaster's men scour the neighborhood for them. Cage insists that he will take Piranha to the police, despite Piranha wanting to pay Cage as a \"hero for hire\". After a discussion about their respective fathers, Cage decides to take Piranha to Lucas's church for protection. Shades and Comanche unsuccessfully search for Piranha, and reminisce about their relationship in prison. Comanche believes that Shades should get rid of Dillard and become the crime lord of Harlem himself. Shades later tells Dillard about following Bushmaster to the restaurant, and she plans what they will do to his acquaintances once they find Piranha, who has control of their money. Cage contacts Bushmaster, and the two meet to fight, ending with Cage paralyzed by a powdered substance and kicked into a river to drown.\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = On and On\n |DirectedBy = Rashaad Ernesto Green\n |WrittenBy = Nicole Mirante Matthews\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = The paralysis wears off in time for Cage to swim to the surface, and he returns to the church to find Piranha missing. Ridenhour attempts to convince Knight to return to work, and tells her about having an informant working for Dillard. She instead works with Cage to find Piranha. Dillard realizes that Ridenhour has an informant herself, and questions the loyalty of her men. Meanwhile, Bushmaster captures Piranha, uses him to take all of Dillard's money and assets, and then kills him. Cage and Knight find the body. Ridenhour meets with Comanche, who is panicking about potentially being caught, but Shades follows Comanche to this meeting. Comanche kills Ridenhour, and then Shades shoots Comanche and makes it look like Ridenhour did it. Dillard rushes to go into hiding with Johnson, but is caught by Bushmaster who leaves them in a burning house as revenge for the Stokes family burning his mother alive. Bushmaster then claims the Stokes family's nightclub, \"Harlem's Paradise,\" as his while Cage saves Dillard and Johnson.\n{{hr}}\n[[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]] performs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJL76KFEU5/|title=Consider yourself lucky if you get to feel the groove of @stephenmarley's music live in person. 06.22.18, only at #HarlemsParadise.

Cage takes Dillard and Johnson to the police precinct, where Knight\u2014who had not officially completed her resignation\u2014is now in charge. Shades arrives, and Knight deduces that he likely killed Comanche and/or Ridenhour, but she does not have any evidence that he did. Dillard and Johnson are shot at by Bushmaster's men outside the precinct, but Cage helps them escape. Knight uses this to get a search warrant for Harlem's Paradise, but they find nothing incriminating. Concerned for the safety of his loved ones, Cage attends a service at the church and is there to protect his father when Bushmaster's men arrive. At the same time, Dillard and Johnson are attacked while Dillard is explaining how she had been forced to give her daughter up to her cousins the Johnson family by Stokes matriarch Mama Mabel. Knight and Tyler arrive to protect them, shortly followed by Cage and Lucas, and Cage asks Knight to call Rand for help.\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = For Pete's Sake\n |DirectedBy = [[Clark Johnson]]\n |WrittenBy = Matt Owens & Ian Stokes\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = Knight gets Cage, Lucas, Dillard, and Johnson to an unfinished building belonging to Rand Enterprises, where Dillard agrees to testify against Bushmaster in exchange for immunity. Knight and Cage are against this, but agree that they can only fight one at a time. Knight returns to the precinct, where Deputy Chief Priscilla Ridley is now in command. Cage tells Johnson that Dillard murdered their cousin [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell Stokes]], and Dillard admits to this when Johnson confronts her. Dillard explains that Stokes was taunting her about how she had been raped as a girl by their Uncle Pete, and reveals that this was how Johnson was conceived and why Dillard does not love her. With Bushmaster putting up a large bounty for Dillard, Tyler tips him off to the group's location. There, Cage is able to defeat Bushmaster. Dillard escapes and reunites with Shades, who has captured Bushmaster's uncle Paul \"Anansi\" MacIntosh. Bushmaster also escapes, by setting off a grenade and then forcing Johnson to heal him.

Realizing that he would need to be healed following his escape from the police, they begin searching for Johnson but do not find her at her shop or at Harlem's Paradise. Working with a tip from [[Turk Barrett]], they investigate an abandoned warehouse where the Jamaicans are attempting to grow more nightshade, but it requires the conditions of Jamaica. Cage and Rand fight their way through the men there, and destroy the lab when they do not find Johnson or Bushmaster. Knight and Ridley discover Tyler's betrayal and arrest her. Because Piranha was tortured before giving Dillard's money and assets to Bushmaster, these are legally returned to her and she reclaims Harlem's Paradise. Embracing her Stokes heritage, she has everyone at the Jamaican restaurant murdered, and then burns Anansi alive to send a message to Bushmaster.

After the business deal between his father, Quincy McIver, and Samuel \"Buggy\" Stokes broke down in the 1980s and led to their deaths, Bushmaster's mother Gwen tried to sue the Stokes family and Buggy's wife Mabel burned down Gwen's house in response. Bushmaster survived, but was shot by Pete Stokes. He was saved by nightshade, and now Johnson is able to heal him with it again. She warns that it is close to killing him through organ failure. He allows her to leave. Meanwhile, Cage finds Anansi's wife Ingrid, who survived the restaurant shooting, but she refuses to testify against Dillard. He takes her to see her husband's body, where they find Bushmaster; he and Cage agree that their next fight will be their last. Going against a Stokes family rule, Dillard makes a deal to start selling heroin in Harlem. Shades confronts her about her recent actions, leading to an altercation and an end to their relationship.

He attacks the refinery where the drugs are being produced, shutting it down with Cage's help. Bushmaster flees when Cage refuses to let him destroy evidence of the drugs. Cage then visits Dillard, and tells her that he will no longer protect her. Dillard announces a free concert at Harlem's Paradise to ensure that there will be enough people around that Cage will show up to protect them from Bushmaster anyway. Johnson offers to help Bushmaster kill Dillard, showing him a secret entrance to the club and giving him extra nightshade as a final boost of strength. Shades confesses all he knows to the police, but they need proof that Dillard owns the gun used to kill Anansi. He goes to the club during the concert, and is with Dillard when Bushmaster attacks. Cage and Knight are able to stop Bushmaster, but he gets away when Cage refuses to kill him.

Shades suggests to Cage that he replace Dillard to prevent a new crime boss taking over. Cage threatens Italian boss [[Rosalie Carbone]], ensuring she stays out of Harlem. In prison, Dillard makes moves to gain power and orders the murders of all of her former contacts and employees. Johnson helps Bushmaster begin to recover from his nightshade use, and he chooses to return to Jamaica. He tells her that Dillard must still burn. Johnson decides to visit Dillard, who tells her that Harlem's Paradise is her birthright. Johnson then gives Dillard a slow-acting poison, and she eventually dies while Cage is visiting. Johnson has her mother cremated. With Dillard dead, Shades' deal no longer holds and he is arrested. When Dillard's will is read, it has been changed so the club now goes to Cage. This angers Johnson, and concerns Knight who worries that Cage will become a criminal like Dillard.

We know the world that we\u2019re in and we know sort of what works and what doesn\u2019t work and we\u2019re just gonna double down on that stuff, so look forward to a very exciting and very relevant and pop culture-heavy show.\"<ref name=\"ColterJul2017\" /> He added that after the first season and the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', Cage would have \"a whole new outlook on life\" and would not be dealing with the judicial system anymore.<ref name=\"ColterJul2017Music\" /> Coker explained that the storyline for the season did not come from any particular iteration of the comics, and instead was based on the characters that appear: \"who is Luke Cage and getting much deeper into that, but also finding out different things about Mariah Dillard, also finding out things about Misty Knight,\" including getting her mechanical arm \"and what that entails from an emotional standpoint.\" In particular, the new villains introduced for the season and their abilities impacted the story in terms of \"what that represents against Luke\".<ref name=\"CokerFeb2018\" /> Each episode of the season is named after a [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] song,<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\" /> just as Coker named each episode of the first season after a [[Gang Starr]] song.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Panel\" />\n\n===Casting===\nColter returns to star as Cage,<ref name=\"FilmDates\" /> along with [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]],<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"Dawson&FilmingStart\" /> [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]],<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" /> and [[Theo Rossi]] as [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]].<ref name=\"RossiReturn\" /> In July 2017, Marvel announced the casting of [[Mustafa Shakir]] as [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John McIver]], and [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]].<ref name=\"LukeCage2Cast\" />\n\n[[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Q. Jones]] reprises his role as [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]] in the season,<ref name=\"Comanche\" /> along with Danny Johnson as [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]],<ref name=\"Smith\" /> and Justin Swain as Mark Bailey.<ref name=\"Swain\" /> In October 2017, it was revealed that [[Finn Jones]] would be reprising his role as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]] in the season.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> Colter explained that there had been interest from fans to see more of the previously established relationship between Cage and Jessica Jones, but for this season they \"went out on a limb\" and decided to give to the fans of the \"Heroes for Hire\" instead by having Cage and Rand team up for part of the season. He added that Finn Jones \"will bring some fresh blood in the new season\".<ref name=\"ColterIF\" /> [[Jessica Henwick]] also reprises her ''Iron Fist'' role, appearing as [[Colleen Wing]].<ref name=\"Henwick\"/> Following the death of [[Reg E. Cathey]] in February 2018, Marvel revealed that his final performance was as Luke Cage's father [[James Lucas (comics)|James Lucas]] in this season.<ref name=\"Cathey\" /> The character appeared briefly in the first season portrayed by an unnamed actor.<ref name=\"JamesLucasS1\" />\n\nIn March 2018, [[Annabella Sciorra]] was announced to have been cast in the \"key role\" of [[Rosalie Carbone]].<ref name=\"Sciorra\" /> The next month, [[Antonique Smith]] joined the cast as Detective Nandi Tyler, a longtime rival of Misty Knight.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> Additionally, [[Elden Henson]] reprises his role as [[Foggy Nelson]] from previous Marvel/Netflix series.<ref name=\"CBRReview\" />\n\nThe season also features [[cameo appearance]]s by [[ESPN]] personalities [[Michael Smith (sports reporter)|Michael Smith]], [[Jemele Hill]], and [[Stephen A. Smith]], and [[New York Jets]] head coach [[Todd Bowles]], doubling as the head coach of the fictional Harlem Jets. As Coker is a sports fan, he decided to include the ESPN personalities and was partially motivated to reach out to Michael Smith and Hill out of \"professional admiration\". Coker noted the additional difficulty in getting the duo to appear because of Marvel's confidentiality requirements, meaning they could not see the scripts beforehand. Dialogue was written for the personalities, though each improvised some of it to make it sound like their own voice. Before reaching out to Bowles, Coker was going to ask [[David Shaw (American football)|David Shaw]], head coach of the [[Stanford University]] [[Stanford Cardinal football|Cardinal football]] team, since Shaw and Coker were college roommates, but the timing did not work out, as Shaw was [[College recruiting|recruiting]] students on the other side of the country. Coker then approached former Jets head coach [[Herm Edwards]], since Edwards had one of Coker's \"favorite coach meltdowns of all time\", but Edwards also could not coordinate an appearance, resulting Coker approaching Bowles.<ref name=\"SportsCameos\" />\n\nWriter, author, and educator [[Jelani Cobb]] also cameos in the season, appearing as himself on a talk show speaking to Luke Cage's ability to fix Harlem. Cobb, who has \"an ambivalent relationship\" to the character of Luke Cage, \"went back and forth\" on whether he would appear in the season. He noted, \"I really like the show and thought it\u2019d be a fun thing to do, but I also think that sometimes it\u2019s important for journalists to keep a separate line from what they\u2019re actually doing versus the imaginary stuff that they\u2019re doing, especially in the era of [[Fake news websites in the United States|fake news]].\" Cobb discussed the potential appearances with \"some of the people I respect in the field\" for their opinion, and after gaining their approval, agreed to appear.<ref name=\"CobbCameo\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began by June 10, 2017,<ref name=\"Dawson&FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmDates\" /> under the series' [[working title]] ''Tiara''.<ref name=\"FilmDates\" /> Production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] that November.<ref name=\"FilmEnd\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=Music is at the center of every decision I make for the show, probably to the point where it annoys most people.|source=\u2014Showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker on his use of music in ''Luke Cage''<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" />}}\nIn July 2017, Colter said that the second season would have \"another feel to it\" in terms of the music, praising the season's musical guests and explaining that he and Coker had chosen a \"certain type\" of music for the season after listening to it at a birthday party and agreeing that there had \"not been one bad song\" played.<ref name=\"ColterJul2017Music\" /> Coker later explained that the season would explore the roots of hip-hop with blues and reggae, after the first season introduced hip-hop to the MCU. He added that the season would explore \"the entire diaspora of black music\" along with different cultures.<ref name=\"CokerFeb2018\" /> [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] again composed the score for the season, working out of Younge's studio Linear Labs. Their music for the season included a \"50-minute epic\" for one of the episodes.<ref name=\"YoungeS2\" /> Coker described the pair as being as \"important to the success of the show as anyone in the cast, anyone directing, anyone writing, producing, period.\"<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" />\n\nCoker wanted to have live musical performances in the season again after the first, and hoped that some musicians who had turned him down for the first season would be happy to join the second after getting to see the series.<ref name=\"CokerMoreMusic\" /> He noted that the idea of performing in the series was not a \"home run in terms of the music community\" during the first season, and he had to call in a lot of favors from his time as a music journalist to get the performers who did appear. For the second season, he was able to show footage of the first season performances as well as point out where musicians who performed on the show received \"immediate streaming bumps\" from fans discovering them through the series. With Coker subsequently having his \"choice of acts\", the season includes live performance from [[Faith Evans]], returning from the first season, along with [[Joi (singer)|Joi]] & [[D-Nice]], [[Gary Clark Jr.]], [[Esperanza Spalding]], [[Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]], [[Jadakiss]], [[KRS-One]], and [[Rakim]]. The latter wrote an original song for the series, which he performs in the season finale. The season also includes music from [[Nina Simone]] and [[Mobb Deep]].<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nFollowing the death of Captain Ridenhour, high-ranking detective [[Mayhem (comics)|Brigid O'Reilly]] is mentioned as having recently moved to New Orleans, in reference to that character's role in the series ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]''.<ref name=\"C&DCrossover\" /><ref name=\"OReillyHarlem\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Luke Cage'' was released on June 22, 2018,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Season2\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nAn advanced screening of the season was hosted by [[Spotify]], [[Netflix]], and the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] on June 19, followed by an after-party featuring musical performances by KRS-One, Younge and Muhammad, and surprise guests.<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" /> The season had its red carpet premiere in New York City on June 21, 2018.<ref name=\"RedCarpetPremiere\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 85% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.18/10 based on 62 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Marvel's Luke Cage'' surpasses the successes of its debut season with a satisfyingly complex narrative and a solid ensemble cast led by Alfre Woodard's standout performance as the archvillainess Black Mariah.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAwarding the \"excellent\" season four stars out of five, Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' said, \"Most of Marvel\u2019s superhero series suffer a mid-season sag, without enough plot to fill their episode quota. This season never succumbs to that because it\u2019s not rooted in plot but character. There are episodes where little happens in terms of event, but characters deepen and crack, becoming less who they want to be and more who they have to be, even Luke. ''Luke Cage'' could now remove any superhero elements almost entirely and still function as a series.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt the season was \"spectacular, full of unforgettable performances, and has not one but two top-notch villains\". Though he felt the season started slow, the later episodes are \"where the magic happens\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" /> Alison Keene at [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt the \"last few episodes are fantastic \u2014 it just takes a lot to get there.\" Keene also felt \"There are plenty of things this season does well, really well, but there is so much filler and narrative dragging of feet in between that it\u2019s hard to recommend it outright,\" awarding the season three stars out of four.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\n[[CNN]]'s Brian Lowry was more critical of the season, feeling the season was \"weaker\" than the first, noting it was \"not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump.\"<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> Similar to Lowry, Alan Sepinwall at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the season two stars out of four, noting the 13-episode season had \"only three or four episodes' worth of story at best\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\"

name]], sees Cage become a hero and celebrity in Harlem after clearing his name, only to face a new threat. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Cheo Hodari Coker]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Mike Colter]] stars as Cage, alongside returning principal cast members [[Simone Missick]], [[Theo Rossi]], and [[Alfre Woodard]]. They are joined by [[Gabrielle Dennis]] and [[Mustafa Shakir]], with [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Finn Jones]], and [[Stephen Rider]] reprising their roles from other Marvel/Netflix series; [[Rosario Dawson]] also returns in a guest role. The season was ordered in December 2016, and filmed in New York City from June to November 2017. Coker again emphasized music in the season: [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] returned to compose the original score, using blues and reggae to represent the conflict between the Stokes family and Shakir's [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]; the season again features performances from various artists; and each episode is named after a [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] song. [[Reg E. Cathey]] has a recurring role as Cage's father in one of his last performances, and the season is dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe season premiered on June 21, 2018, before all 13 episodes were released on [[Netflix]] on June 22. It was widely praised as better than the [[Luke Cage (season 1)|first season]], particularly for its narrative and cast\u2014Woodard's performance especially\u2014though there was again some criticism for its pacing. Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Cancellation\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#93A9A7|overall=5 |season=5 |title=20 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after a [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] song.<ref name=\"S2EpTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/03/luke-cage-season-2-episodes-named-after-pete-rock-cl-smooth-songs|title=Luke Cage Season 2 Episodes Are Named After Pete Rock & CL Smooth Songs|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=March 7, 2018|accessdate=March 28, 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6yFNvPy1I?url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2018/03/luke-cage-season-2-episodes-named-after-pete-rock-cl-smooth-songs|archivedate=March 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} |director=15 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-luke-cage/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's luke cage on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Soul Brother #1\n |DirectedBy = [[Lucy Liu]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Cheo Hodari Coker]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = [[Luke Cage]], the bulletproof defender of Harlem, has become a celebrity. His friend D.W. Griffith attempts to earn him some money through merchandise and an app that tracks Cage's whereabouts. He spends his nights trying to stop a group from distributing drugs under his name. Following the secret battle at Midland Circle, [[Misty Knight]] is recovering from the loss of her arm and does not intend to return to police work, until she discovers that up to 30 of the criminals she previously sent to prison have now been released due to her late corrupt partner Rafael Scarfe. One of these criminals is [[Cockroach Hamilton|Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton]], who is looking to buy [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]]'s criminal empire alongside drug smuggler Arturo \"El Rey\" Gomez III and Jamaican gang leader Nigel Garrison. Griffith helps Cage identify El Rey as the \"Luke Cage\" drug cartel leader and turns him over to Knight's captain Tom Ridenhour, while Garrison is murdered by [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|John \"Bushmaster\" McIver]], who survives several gun shots and has arrived from Jamaica planning to take Harlem from Dillard.\n{{hr}}\n[[Joi (singer)|Joi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj-Sjlbl4IL/|title=Don\u2019t miss Joi (@tennesseeslimkitty) at #HarlemsParadise June 22.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Poster by @oregon_pizza.|author=Marvel's Luke Cage [@marvelslukecage]|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> [[D-Nice]], and [[Donald Harrison]] perform.\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Straighten It Out\n |DirectedBy = Steph Green\n |WrittenBy = Akela Cooper\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = Bushmaster visits holistic doctor [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Tilda Johnson]] to get ingredients for augmenting the plant nightshade, which he uses to heal his wounds and increase his strength. Johnson is Dillard's daughter, and is also visited by her mother, who wants to publicly reunite with Johnson, after years apart, to improve her image. Dillard wants to transition to a legitimate business woman, which is why she is selling her gun business. She organizes for El Rey to be released on bail and sends her lover [[Shades (comics)|Hernan \"Shades\" Alvarez]] to complete the sale with him. When El Rey refuses, and disrespects Dillard, Shades kills him. Knight is now on \"light duty\" and unable to pursue leads, but directs Cage to Cockroach. Cage believes he is indestructible, but Cockroach is able to injure him with the force of a close-range, high-power gun. This bothers Cage's girlfriend, former nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], who is struggling with her inability to help Cage as well as his reluctance to mend his relationship with his estranged father James Lucas.

A horrified Temple calls Knight, who lets Cage leave the scene before her rival detective Nandi Tyler, as well as Tyler's partner Mark Bailey, arrive. Knight is later reprimanded for this, but Ridenhour explains that he cannot suspend Knight due to her high status within the department as a disabled hero. Knight later practices fighting with one arm, and lets out some frustration, with [[Colleen Wing]] (who Knight had been defending when she lost her arm). With El Rey dead and Cockroach in the hospital, Shades turns to Garrison; he finds Bushmaster instead, who is more than willing to pay Dillard the money. Cage later arrives looking for Garrison, and fights several gang members who are armed with different weapons. Bushmaster secretly films this and trains in front of the footage. After meeting with Lucas, Temple confronts Cage about his anger, and he lashes out. She asks him to leave, and he runs into Bushmaster.\n{{hr}}\n[[Esperanza Spalding]] performs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://instagram.com/p/BkQxv6uFrSS/|title=You're going to be singing this song again. @esperanzaspalding is one of the best artists out there today.|author=Marvel's Luke Cage [@marvelslukecage]|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 93A9A7\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Luke Cage (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 17\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = I Get Physical\n |DirectedBy = [[Salli Richardson-Whitfield]]\n |WrittenBy = Matthew Lopes\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|6|22}}\n |ShortSummary = Bushmaster knocks Cage unconscious, and footage of their fight spreads across the internet.

They discover Garrison's body, and Knight is able to talk to the owner of the building who grew up with Bushmaster and explains that he intends to right the perceived wrongs committed against his parents. From evidence at the building, Cage visits Johnson and she gives him medicine to help with his concussion. Bushmaster visits Dillard, and reveals that his ancestors were once in business with hers. Shades follows him back to a restaurant run by his acquaintances, while Shades' friend [[Comanche (comics)|Darius \"Comanche\" Jones]]\u2014who has been clashing with Dillard\u2014secretly reports to Ridenhour.

Broker [[Piranha Jones|Raymond \"Piranha\" Jones]] invests the money from Dillard's sale to Bushmaster in the plastics company of Mike Higgins, who Dillard blackmails into agreeing to a corporate merger that increases the profits of her new shares considerably. Higgins subsequently disappears, while Dillard uses her new \"legitimate\" fortune to open a Family First center in Harlem. She reveals all of this to Johnson, hoping that they can run the center together. Piranha throws a party to celebrate their successful venture, and hires Cage\u2014who is looking for a way to pay Cockroach\u2014to appear at the party.

Cage and Piranha go into hiding as Bushmaster's men scour the neighborhood for them. Cage insists that he will take Piranha to the police, despite Piranha wanting to pay Cage as a \"hero for hire\". After a discussion about their respective fathers, Cage decides to take Piranha to Lucas's church for protection. Shades and Comanche unsuccessfully search for Piranha, and reminisce about their relationship in prison. Comanche believes that Shades should get rid of Dillard and become the crime lord of Harlem himself. Shades later tells Dillard about following Bushmaster to the restaurant, and she plans what they will do to his acquaintances once they find Piranha, who has control of their money.

Ridenhour attempts to convince Knight to return to work, and tells her about having an informant working for Dillard. She instead works with Cage to find Piranha. Dillard realizes that Ridenhour has an informant herself, and questions the loyalty of her men. Meanwhile, Bushmaster captures Piranha, uses him to take all of Dillard's money and assets, and then kills him. Cage and Knight find the body. Ridenhour meets with Comanche, who is panicking about potentially being caught, but Shades follows Comanche to this meeting. Comanche kills Ridenhour, and then Shades shoots Comanche and makes it look like Ridenhour did it. Dillard rushes to go into hiding with Johnson, but is caught by Bushmaster who leaves them in a burning house as revenge for the Stokes family burning his mother alive.

Shades arrives, and Knight deduces that he likely killed Comanche and/or Ridenhour, but she does not have any evidence that he did. Dillard and Johnson are shot at by Bushmaster's men outside the precinct, but Cage helps them escape. Knight uses this to get a search warrant for Harlem's Paradise, but they find nothing incriminating. Concerned for the safety of his loved ones, Cage attends a service at the church and is there to protect his father when Bushmaster's men arrive. At the same time, Dillard and Johnson are attacked while Dillard is explaining how she had been forced to give her daughter up to her cousins the Johnson family by Stokes matriarch Mama Mabel.

Knight and Cage are against this, but agree that they can only fight one at a time. Knight returns to the precinct, where Deputy Chief Priscilla Ridley is now in command. Cage tells Johnson that Dillard murdered their cousin [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Stokes)|Cornell Stokes]], and Dillard admits to this when Johnson confronts her. Dillard explains that Stokes was taunting her about how she had been raped as a girl by their Uncle Pete, and reveals that this was how Johnson was conceived and why Dillard does not love her. With Bushmaster putting up a large bounty for Dillard, Tyler tips him off to the group's location. There, Cage is able to defeat Bushmaster. Dillard escapes and reunites with Shades, who has captured Bushmaster's uncle Paul \"Anansi\" MacIntosh. Bushmaster also escapes, by setting off a grenade and then forcing Johnson to heal him.

Realizing that he would need to be healed following his escape from the police, they begin searching for Johnson but do not find her at her shop or at Harlem's Paradise. Working with a tip from [[Turk Barrett]], they investigate an abandoned warehouse where the Jamaicans are attempting to grow more nightshade, but it requires the conditions of Jamaica. Cage and Rand fight their way through the men there, and destroy the lab when they do not find Johnson or Bushmaster. Knight and Ridley discover Tyler's betrayal and arrest her. Because Piranha was tortured before giving Dillard's money and assets to Bushmaster, these are legally returned to her and she reclaims Harlem's Paradise. Embracing her Stokes heritage, she has everyone at the Jamaican restaurant murdered, and then burns Anansi alive to send a message to Bushmaster.

After the business deal between his father, Quincy McIver, and Samuel \"Buggy\" Stokes broke down in the 1980s and led to their deaths, Bushmaster's mother Gwen tried to sue the Stokes family and Buggy's wife Mabel burned down Gwen's house in response. Bushmaster survived, but was shot by Pete Stokes. He was saved by nightshade, and now Johnson is able to heal him with it again. She warns that it is close to killing him through organ failure. He allows her to leave. Meanwhile, Cage finds Anansi's wife Ingrid, who survived the restaurant shooting, but she refuses to testify against Dillard. He takes her to see her husband's body, where they find Bushmaster; he and Cage agree that their next fight will be their last. Going against a Stokes family rule, Dillard makes a deal to start selling heroin in Harlem. Shades confronts her about her recent actions, leading to an altercation and an end to their relationship.

He attacks the refinery where the drugs are being produced, shutting it down with Cage's help. Bushmaster flees when Cage refuses to let him destroy evidence of the drugs. Cage then visits Dillard, and tells her that he will no longer protect her. Dillard announces a free concert at Harlem's Paradise to ensure that there will be enough people around that Cage will show up to protect them from Bushmaster anyway. Johnson offers to help Bushmaster kill Dillard, showing him a secret entrance to the club and giving him extra nightshade as a final boost of strength. Shades confesses all he knows to the police, but they need proof that Dillard owns the gun used to kill Anansi. He goes to the club during the concert, and is with Dillard when Bushmaster attacks. Cage and Knight are able to stop Bushmaster, but he gets away when Cage refuses to kill him.

Shades suggests to Cage that he replace Dillard to prevent a new crime boss taking over. Cage threatens Italian boss [[Rosalie Carbone]], ensuring she stays out of Harlem. In prison, Dillard makes moves to gain power and orders the murders of all of her former contacts and employees. Johnson helps Bushmaster begin to recover from his nightshade use, and he chooses to return to Jamaica. He tells her that Dillard must still burn. Johnson decides to visit Dillard, who tells her that Harlem's Paradise is her birthright. Johnson then gives Dillard a slow-acting poison, and she eventually dies while Cage is visiting. Johnson has her mother cremated. With Dillard dead, Shades' deal no longer holds and he is arrested. When Dillard's will is read, it has been changed so the club now goes to Cage. This angers Johnson, and concerns Knight who worries that Cage will become a criminal like Dillard.

That\u2019s my hope for season 2, is that we have some of the similar sounds, but we go in a deeper direction.\" Coker also noted that music would continue to be an important element for the season and that [[Harlem]] would still be \"at the heart and its center\" for the series.<ref name=\"CokerMashable\" />\n\n===Writing===\nIn July 2017, Colter said the writing for the season was different from the first, because \"we know the show now.

As Coker is a sports fan, he decided to include the ESPN personalities and was partially motivated to reach out to Michael Smith and Hill out of \"professional admiration\". Coker noted the additional difficulty in getting the duo to appear because of Marvel's confidentiality requirements, meaning they could not see the scripts beforehand. Dialogue was written for the personalities, though each improvised some of it to make it sound like their own voice. Before reaching out to Bowles, Coker was going to ask [[David Shaw (American football)|David Shaw]], head coach of the [[Stanford University]] [[Stanford Cardinal football|Cardinal football]] team, since Shaw and Coker were college roommates, but the timing did not work out, as Shaw was [[College recruiting|recruiting]] students on the other side of the country.

He noted, \"I really like the show and thought it\u2019d be a fun thing to do, but I also think that sometimes it\u2019s important for journalists to keep a separate line from what they\u2019re actually doing versus the imaginary stuff that they\u2019re doing, especially in the era of [[Fake news websites in the United States|fake news]].\" Cobb discussed the potential appearances with \"some of the people I respect in the field\" for their opinion, and after gaining their approval, agreed to appear.<ref name=\"CobbCameo\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began by June 10, 2017,<ref name=\"Dawson&FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmDates\" /> under the series' [[working title]] ''Tiara''.<ref name=\"FilmDates\" /> Production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] that November.<ref name=\"FilmEnd\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=Music is at the center of every decision I make for the show, probably to the point where it annoys most people.|source=\u2014Showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker on his use of music in ''Luke Cage''<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" />}}\nIn July 2017, Colter said that the second season would have \"another feel to it\" in terms of the music, praising the season's musical guests and explaining that he and Coker had chosen a \"certain type\" of music for the season after listening to it at a birthday party and agreeing that there had \"not been one bad song\" played.<ref name=\"ColterJul2017Music\" /> Coker later explained that the season would explore the roots of hip-hop with blues and reggae, after the first season introduced hip-hop to the MCU. He added that the season would explore \"the entire diaspora of black music\" along with different cultures.<ref name=\"CokerFeb2018\" /> [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] again composed the score for the season, working out of Younge's studio Linear Labs. Their music for the season included a \"50-minute epic\" for one of the episodes.<ref name=\"YoungeS2\" /> Coker described the pair as being as \"important to the success of the show as anyone in the cast, anyone directing, anyone writing, producing, period.\"<ref name=\"BillboardMusicReveal\" />\n\nCoker wanted to have live musical performances in the season again after the first, and hoped that some musicians who had turned him down for the first season would be happy to join the second after getting to see the series.<ref name=\"CokerMoreMusic\" /> He noted that the idea of performing in the series was not a \"home run in terms of the music community\" during the first season, and he had to call in a lot of favors from his time as a music journalist to get the performers who did appear. For the second season, he was able to show footage of the first season performances as well as point out where musicians who performed on the show received \"immediate streaming bumps\" from fans discovering them through the series. With Coker subsequently having his \"choice of acts\", the season includes live performance from [[Faith Evans]], returning from the first season, along with [[Joi (singer)|Joi]] & [[D-Nice]], [[Gary Clark Jr.]], [[Esperanza Spalding]], [[Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]], [[Jadakiss]], [[KRS-One]], and [[Rakim]].

The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Marvel's Luke Cage'' surpasses the successes of its debut season with a satisfyingly complex narrative and a solid ensemble cast led by Alfre Woodard's standout performance as the archvillainess Black Mariah.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/luke_cage/s02|title=Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-luke-cage/season-2|title=Marvel's Luke Cage : Season 2|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAwarding the \"excellent\" season four stars out of five, Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' said, \"Most of Marvel\u2019s superhero series suffer a mid-season sag, without enough plot to fill their episode quota. This season never succumbs to that because it\u2019s not rooted in plot but character. There are episodes where little happens in terms of event, but characters deepen and crack, becoming less who they want to be and more who they have to be, even Luke. ''Luke Cage'' could now remove any superhero elements almost entirely and still function as a series.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt the season was \"spectacular, full of unforgettable performances, and has not one but two top-notch villains\". Though he felt the season started slow, the later episodes are \"where the magic happens\".<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\" /> Alison Keene at [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt the \"last few episodes are fantastic \u2014 it just takes a lot to get there.\" Keene also felt \"There are plenty of things this season does well, really well, but there is so much filler and narrative dragging of feet in between that it\u2019s hard to recommend it outright,\" awarding the season three stars out of four.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\n[[CNN]]'s Brian Lowry was more critical of the season, feeling the season was \"weaker\" than the first, noting it was \"not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump.\"<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> Similar to Lowry, Alan Sepinwall at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the season two stars out of four, noting the 13-episode season had \"only three or four episodes' worth of story at best\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\"
