It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg. Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]]. Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack. He chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\".

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg. Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]]. Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack. He chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\". A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's [[Rockwilder]] remix.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" shares a similar sound to other [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music popular at the time of its 2000 release, making use of programmed [[Funk music|funk]] that was common among [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]]' productions for R&B girl groups [[TLC (group)|TLC]] and [[Destiny's Child]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> It is considered to be part of the [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Dance music|dance]] genres,<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/><ref name=\"MTV\"/><ref name=\"BillboardTop100\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/9339652/best-songs-of-2000-top-100|title=The 100 Greatest Songs of 2000: Staff Picks|last=Daniel|first=Danica|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 23, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> while film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' also referred to the song as \"soulful [[Pop rap|hip-pop]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=6315|title=Empire's Nutty Professor II: The Klumps Soundtrack Review|website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Online]]|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222162945/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=6315|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}</ref> [[Chuck Taylor (music journalist)|Chuck Taylor]] of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' likened the unique and radical sound of \"Doesn't Really Matter\" to Jackson's previous single \"[[Runaway (Janet Jackson song)|Runaway]]\", stating that it was a throwback track of the previous era.<ref name=\"ChuckBillboard\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31|title=Reviews and Previews|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|authorlink=Chuck Taylor (music journalist)|date=July 10, 2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe song begins with a twenty-second mid-paced introduction sung in a [[breathy voice]].

Between 1978 and 2005, China's [[per capita GDP]] grew from $153 to $1,284. Its [[current account surplus]] increased more than twelve-fold between 1982 and 2004, from $5.7 billion to $71 billion. During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] to the increasingly sophisticated production of [[computers]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[automobiles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how long the Chinese economy can maintain this trajectory. According to the 11th [[five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plan]], China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of [[central planning]] and winning them to the cause of reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the [[Bank|banking sector]] and launching the beginnings of a real [[capital market]]. According to an article in ''Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy'' by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China.<ref>Jalil, Abdul and Feridun, Mete (2011) Long-run relationship between income inequality and financial development in China.

As of 2004, China's [[state-owned enterprise]]s were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in [[non-performing loan]]s, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a [[floating exchange rate]], and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing.

Some government revenues also came from taxes, of which the most important was the general industrial and commercial tax.\n\nThe trend, however, has been for remitted profits of the state enterprises to be replaced with taxes on those profits. Initially, this tax system was adjusted so as to allow for differences in the [[market capitalization]] and pricing situations of various firms, but more-uniform tax schedules were introduced in the early 1990s.

On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.\n\nThe [[rate of exchange]] (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's [[balance of trade]], inflation, measured by the [[consumer price index]] and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's [[central bank]] has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.<ref>Keith Bradsher )29 December 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html \"China Lets Currency Appreciate a Bit Faster\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html |date=8 February 2017 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.<ref name=\"Jalil, Abdul 2010 pp. 189-195\"/>\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.<ref name=\"NYT81315\">{{cite news |author1=Neil Gough |title=China Seeks to Calm Markets as It Devalues Currency for 3rd Consecutive Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/international/china-devalues-its-currency-renminbi-for-a-third-consecutive-day.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |quote=...policy makers say they will give market forces greater sway over currency's value.

Nevertheless, about 60 percent of the population lives in the rural areas, and until the 1980s a high percentage of them made their living directly from farming. Since then, many have been encouraged to leave the fields and pursue other activities, such as [[light manufacturing]], commerce, and transportation; and by the mid-1980s farming accounted for less than half of the value of rural output. Today, agriculture contributes only 13% of China's GDP.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the [[livestock]] output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of [[aquaculture]].

[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html Nuclear Power in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212223045/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html |date=12 February 2013 }} (November 2007)</ref> Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in [[coal]] and [[oil]], the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense [[hydroelectric potential]]. But the industrialized regions around [[Guangzhou]] and the [[Yangtze River|Lower Yangtze]] region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little [[heavy industry]] located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current [[energy mix]] from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70\u201375% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, [[natural gas]], [[Renewable energy in China|renewable energy]], and [[Nuclear power in China|nuclear power]]. China has closed thousands of [[coal mines]] over the past five to ten years to cut [[overproduction]]. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed [[Crude oil|crude]] in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (560,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from [[Central Asia]] and has invested in [[Kazakhstan]]i [[oil field]]s.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

London: Routledge, pp. 115\u2013133.</ref> Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|10th Five-Year Plan]] (2001\u20132005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\nThe [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]] (2006\u201310), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of [[clean coal technology]]. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n====Mining====\n{{see also|Gold mining in China}}\nOutdated [[mining]] and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques, but China's [[industrialization of China|rapid industrialization]] requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from [[mining in Australia|Australia]] and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as [[steel production in China|steel production]] rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. Also China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]].\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were [[coal mining in China|coal]] (nearly 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tons), [[iron ore]] (310&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[petroleum industry in China|crude petroleum]] (175&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[natural gas]] (41&nbsp;million cubic meters), [[antimony]] ore (110,000&nbsp;tons), [[tin]] concentrates (110,000 tons), [[nickel]] ore (64,000&nbsp;tons), [[tungsten]] concentrates (67,000&nbsp;tons), unrefined [[salt]] (37&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[vanadium]] (40,000&nbsp;tons), and [[molybdenum]] ore (29,000&nbsp;tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were [[bauxite]], [[gypsum]], [[barite]], [[magnesite]], [[talc]] and related minerals, [[manganese]] ore, [[fluorspar]], and [[zinc]]. In addition, China produced 2,450&nbsp;tons of [[silver]] and 215&nbsp;tons of [[gold]] in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n====Hydroelectric resources====\n[[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Three Gorges Dam]]\nChina has an abundant potential for [[hydroelectric power]] production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the [[Southwest China|southwest of the country]], where coal supplies are poor but [[energy demand|demand for energy]] is rising swiftly.

However, its proportion of GDP is still low compared to the ratio in more developed countries, and the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural sector]] still employs a larger workforce.\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated [[Retailing|shops]], [[rationing]], and regulated prices\u2014with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade has expanded quickly, with numerous [[shopping mall]]s, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas.

Being a [[Second World]] country at the time{{When|date=December 2019}}, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the [[Third World]] was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. The principal efforts were made in Asia, especially to [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, and [[Sri Lanka]], but large loans were also granted in Africa ([[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], [[Tanzania]]) and in the Middle East ([[Egypt]]). However, after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) group, which promotes [[free trade]] and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nAfter reaching a bilateral WTO agreement with the EU and other trading partners in summer 2000, China worked on a multilateral WTO accession package. China concluded multilateral negotiations on its accession to the WTO in September 2001. The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest [[port]]s in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233&nbsp;billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%.

During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13&nbsp;billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05&nbsp;billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368&nbsp;million during January\u2013September 2005, twice that in 2004.\n\n[[File:E7210-NN-kitaj-auto.jpg|thumb|Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry]]\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the [[Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]], adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n==Foreign investment==\n{{see also|Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China|Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor|Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor|China Investment Promotion Agency|China Council for the Promotion of International Trade|Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China}}\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms.

In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for [[Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise]]s and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state, such as energy, communications and transportation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in [[Shanghai]] and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of [[stock]] in selected companies listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange|Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]] Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45&nbsp;billion in [[foreign direct investment]].

In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totalled about $145&nbsp;billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment after the United States. China received $39&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 1999 and $41&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 2000.

Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.<ref>{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Salmon |date=29 October 2004 |title = Shanghai Automotive expands with Korea purchase |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-ssang_ed3_.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Choe |first = Sang-Hun |date = 24 February 2009 |title = In Carmaker's Collapse, a Microcosm of South Korea's Woes |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |page = A6 |access-date = 18 February 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723022736/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date = 23 July 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint vendure called TCL-Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book ''Resumption of Trading'' by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n* According to Scott Markman, president of Monogram, Chinese companies often moved their business model to developed countries and it doesn't work. Thomson has the problem, they are very good and distribution and operation in China but France and Europe is a totally different world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known value of US$969 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |title=Statistics on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) \u2013 M&A Courses &#124; Company Valuation Courses &#124; Mergers & Acquisitions Courses |publisher=Imaa-institute.org |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106045040/http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |archive-date=6 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The number and value of deals hit a new record in 2010.

Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The [[population growth]] rate surged as the [[mortality rate]] dropped more rapidly than the [[birth rate]]. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major [[birth control]] program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958\u201360 was partially responsible for a huge [[Great Chinese Famine|famine]] that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second [[population control]] drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of [[contraceptive]]s. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second [[family planning]] program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the [[one-child policy|one child per family policy]] was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1&nbsp;billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3&nbsp;billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.<ref>[[List of countries by population growth rate]]</ref> China's [[population growth rate]] is now among the lowest for a [[developing country]], although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly [[Population ageing|ageing]] countries in the world.\n\nFrom 100&nbsp;million to 150&nbsp;million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time, low-paying jobs.\n\nAccording to the latest [[Forbes China Rich List]] (2007), China had 66 [[billionaire]]s, the second largest number after the [[Forbes 400|United States]], which had 415.

This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the Communist Party of China, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.<ref name=\"CNBC011913\">{{cite news |title=Chinese Labor Pool Begins to Drain |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |publisher=CNBC |date=19 January 2013 |author=Jamil Anderliniin |author2=Ed Crooks |agency=Financial Times |accessdate=8 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328064737/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |archive-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation and infrastructure==\n{{main|Transport in China}}\n\n[[File:A maglev train coming out, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Shanghai Maglev Train]]]]\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]: [http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926172608/http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet [[military transport]] and [[Military logistics|logistics]] needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of [[ocean shipping]] was broadened considerably.\n\n[[Freight]] [[Logistics|haulage]] is mainly provided by [[rail transport]]. The rail sector is monopolized by [[China Railway]] and there is wide variation in services provided.

This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.<ref>{{cite news |first1 = Vincent |last1 = Bazi |first2 = M.

Between 1978 and 2005, China's [[per capita GDP]] grew from $153 to $1,284. Its [[current account surplus]] increased more than twelve-fold between 1982 and 2004, from $5.7 billion to $71 billion. During this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond initial successes in low-wage sectors like [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] to the increasingly sophisticated production of [[computers]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[automobiles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how long the Chinese economy can maintain this trajectory. According to the 11th [[five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plan]], China needed to sustain an annual growth rate of 8% for the foreseeable future. Only with such levels of growth, the leadership argued, could China continue to develop its industrial prowess, raise its citizen's standard of living, and redress the inequalities that were cropping up across the country. Yet no country had ever before maintained the kind of growth that China was predicting. Moreover, China had to some extent already undergone the easier parts of development. In the 1980s, it had transformed its vast and inefficient agricultural sector, freeing its peasants from the confines of [[central planning]] and winning them to the cause of reform. In the 1990s, it had likewise started to restructure its stagnant industrial sector, wooing foreign investors for the first time. These policies had catalysed the country's phenomenal growth. Instead, China had to take what many regarded as the final step toward the market, liberalizing the [[Bank|banking sector]] and launching the beginnings of a real [[capital market]]. According to an article in ''Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy'' by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and Abdul Jalil from Wuhan University in China, financial development leads to a reduction in the income inequality in China.<ref>Jalil, Abdul and Feridun, Mete (2011) Long-run relationship between income inequality and financial development in China.

As of 2004, China's [[state-owned enterprise]]s were still only partially reorganized, and its banks were dealing with the burden of over $205 billion (1.7 trillion RMB) in [[non-performing loan]]s, monies that had little chance of ever being repaid. The country had a [[floating exchange rate]], and strict controls on both the current and capital accounts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn mid-2014 China announced it was taking steps to boost the economy, which at the time was running at a rate 7.4% per annum, but was slowing.

Some government revenues also came from taxes, of which the most important was the general industrial and commercial tax.\n\nThe trend, however, has been for remitted profits of the state enterprises to be replaced with taxes on those profits. Initially, this tax system was adjusted so as to allow for differences in the [[market capitalization]] and pricing situations of various firms, but more-uniform tax schedules were introduced in the early 1990s.

On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to fluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.\n\nThe [[rate of exchange]] (Chinese yuan per US$1) on 31 July 2008, was RMB 6.846, in mid-2007 was RMB 7.45, while in early 2006 was RMB 8.07:US$1=8.2793 yuan (January 2000), 8.2783 (1999), 8.2790 (1998), 8.2898 (1997), 8.3142 (1996), 8.3514 (1995).\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's [[balance of trade]], inflation, measured by the [[consumer price index]] and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's [[central bank]] has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation in 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably related to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel. Thus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are possibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi to be worth more.<ref>Keith Bradsher )29 December 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html \"China Lets Currency Appreciate a Bit Faster\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29yuan.html |date=8 February 2017 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> An article published in International Review of Economics & Finance in 2010 by Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich Business School) and his colleagues provide empirical evidence that financial development fosters economic growth in China.<ref name=\"Jalil, Abdul 2010 pp. 189-195\"/>\n\nDuring the week of 10 August 2015, against the background of a slowing Chinese economy and appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by about 5%.<ref name=\"NYT81315\">{{cite news |author1=Neil Gough |title=China Seeks to Calm Markets as It Devalues Currency for 3rd Consecutive Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/international/china-devalues-its-currency-renminbi-for-a-third-consecutive-day.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2015 |quote=...policy makers say they will give market forces greater sway over currency's value.

Nevertheless, about 60 percent of the population lives in the rural areas, and until the 1980s a high percentage of them made their living directly from farming. Since then, many have been encouraged to leave the fields and pursue other activities, such as [[light manufacturing]], commerce, and transportation; and by the mid-1980s farming accounted for less than half of the value of rural output. Today, agriculture contributes only 13% of China's GDP.\n\n[[Animal husbandry]] constitutes the second most important component of agricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the [[livestock]] output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of [[aquaculture]].

[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html Nuclear Power in China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212223045/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html |date=12 February 2013 }} (November 2007)</ref> Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in [[coal]] and [[oil]], the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense [[hydroelectric potential]]. But the industrialized regions around [[Guangzhou]] and the [[Yangtze River|Lower Yangtze]] region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little [[heavy industry]] located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current [[energy mix]] from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70\u201375% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, [[natural gas]], [[Renewable energy in China|renewable energy]], and [[Nuclear power in China|nuclear power]]. China has closed thousands of [[coal mines]] over the past five to ten years to cut [[overproduction]]. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed [[Crude oil|crude]] in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[barrel (unit)|barrels]] (560,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from [[Central Asia]] and has invested in [[Kazakhstan]]i [[oil field]]s.<ref>Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \u201c[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329310641 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia]\u201d, in Fanny M.

London: Routledge, pp. 115\u2013133.</ref> Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|10th Five-Year Plan]] (2001\u20132005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.\n\nThe [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]] (2006\u201310), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the use of [[clean coal technology]]. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.\n\n====Mining====\n{{see also|Gold mining in China}}\nOutdated [[mining]] and ore-processing technologies are being replaced with modern techniques, but China's [[industrialization of China|rapid industrialization]] requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from [[mining in Australia|Australia]] and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as [[steel production in China|steel production]] rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production. Also China has become increasingly active in several African countries to mine the reserves it requires for economic growth, particularly in countries such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]].\n\nThe major areas of production in 2004 were [[coal mining in China|coal]] (nearly 2&nbsp;billion&nbsp;tons), [[iron ore]] (310&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[petroleum industry in China|crude petroleum]] (175&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[natural gas]] (41&nbsp;million cubic meters), [[antimony]] ore (110,000&nbsp;tons), [[tin]] concentrates (110,000 tons), [[nickel]] ore (64,000&nbsp;tons), [[tungsten]] concentrates (67,000&nbsp;tons), unrefined [[salt]] (37&nbsp;million&nbsp;tons), [[vanadium]] (40,000&nbsp;tons), and [[molybdenum]] ore (29,000&nbsp;tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were [[bauxite]], [[gypsum]], [[barite]], [[magnesite]], [[talc]] and related minerals, [[manganese]] ore, [[fluorspar]], and [[zinc]]. In addition, China produced 2,450&nbsp;tons of [[silver]] and 215&nbsp;tons of [[gold]] in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.\n\n====Hydroelectric resources====\n[[File:Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Three Gorges Dam]]\nChina has an abundant potential for [[hydroelectric power]] production due to its considerable river network and mountainous terrain. Most of the total hydroelectric capacity is situated in the [[Southwest China|southwest of the country]], where coal supplies are poor but [[energy demand|demand for energy]] is rising swiftly.

However, its proportion of GDP is still low compared to the ratio in more developed countries, and the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural sector]] still employs a larger workforce.\n\nPrior to the onset of economic reforms in 1978, China's services sector was characterized by state-operated [[Retailing|shops]], [[rationing]], and regulated prices\u2014with reform came private markets, individual entrepreneurs, and a commercial sector. The [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade has expanded quickly, with numerous [[shopping mall]]s, retail shops, restaurant chains and hotels constructed in urban areas.

Being a [[Second World]] country at the time{{When|date=December 2019}}, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the [[Third World]] was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance. The principal efforts were made in Asia, especially to [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], Pakistan, and [[Sri Lanka]], but large loans were also granted in Africa ([[Ghana]], [[Algeria]], [[Tanzania]]) and in the Middle East ([[Egypt]]). However, after [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back. After which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during that time, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] both began to emerge as major trading partners.\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize its foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading system. In November 1991, China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) group, which promotes [[free trade]] and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nAfter reaching a bilateral WTO agreement with the EU and other trading partners in summer 2000, China worked on a multilateral WTO accession package. China concluded multilateral negotiations on its accession to the WTO in September 2001. The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years of negotiations, the longest in the history of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

About 80 percent of China's exports consist of manufactured goods, most of which are textiles and electronic equipment, with agricultural products and chemicals constituting the remainder. Out of the five busiest [[port]]s in the world, three are in China. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $233&nbsp;billion in 2006, as imports grew 18%.

During the same time, China's export of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of China's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade between the two countries reached $5.13&nbsp;billion, growing 35% and accounting for nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain apparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China is now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750 investment projects in Russia, involving $1.05&nbsp;billion. China's contracted investment in Russia totaled $368&nbsp;million during January\u2013September 2005, twice that in 2004.\n\n[[File:E7210-NN-kitaj-auto.jpg|thumb|Chinese cars at a dealer's lot in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], the traditional capital of the Russian automotive industry]]\nChinese imports from Russia are mainly those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and electricity exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports of both of these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the [[Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations with a view of future exports to China.\n\nExport growth has continued to be a major component supporting China's rapid economic growth. To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering the rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported components into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights. In its [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|11th Five-Year Program]], adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis on developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and address imbalances.\n\n==Foreign investment==\n{{see also|Foreign Investment Law of the People's Republic of China|Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor|Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor|China Investment Promotion Agency|China Council for the Promotion of International Trade|Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China}}\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades of reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-oriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture partnerships with Chinese firms.

In 1991, China granted more preferential tax treatment for [[Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise]]s and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state, such as energy, communications and transportation.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in [[Shanghai]] and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of [[stock]] in selected companies listed on the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange|Shanghai]] and [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]] Securities Exchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45&nbsp;billion in [[foreign direct investment]].

In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totalled about $145&nbsp;billion. Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct investment after the United States. China received $39&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 1999 and $41&nbsp;billion&nbsp;FDI in 2000.

Shanghai Auto wanted the brand and technology to expand its footprint in China. However, the cultural difference, the objection to transfer the technology and the failed sales of new SUV model put Shanghai Auto's ambition of expansion in jeopardy. It caused huge conflict between Ssangyong employees and Shanghai Auto as things didn't go well as planned. And the 2008 global economic crisis put Ssangyong on a survival mode, let alone expansion. After the negotiation with the labor union to reduce wages failed, Shanghai Auto decided to exit from Ssangyong and didn't get a penny back for their US$500 million investment.<ref>{{cite news |first = Andrew |last = Salmon |date=29 October 2004 |title = Shanghai Automotive expands with Korea purchase |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/business/worldbusiness/29iht-ssang_ed3_.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Choe |first = Sang-Hun |date = 24 February 2009 |title = In Carmaker's Collapse, a Microcosm of South Korea's Woes |newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |page = A6 |access-date = 18 February 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723022736/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/world/asia/24seoul.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date = 23 July 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCase 2: In 2004, the television manufacturer TCL acquired TV business including Thomson and RCA brand from Thomson Electronics of France to form a joint vendure called TCL-Thomson Electronics (TTE). For the coming two years, the company recorded huge loss, especially in Europe. Several factors contributed to the failure:\n* Failure of Due Diligence. Right after TCL acquired Thomson's TV business, the TV market shifted to LCD technology, put Thomson out of date. As CEO of TCL, Dongsheng Li, said in 2012 \"They betted on the wrong thing where the market would go. They thought Thomson's DLP could be the best choice.\"\n* Lack of understanding of rules and regulations. According to the book ''Resumption of Trading'' by Chong Chen, soon after acquisition, Thomson found it in a situation that they couldn't recruit the talents they wanted and can't fire ones they didn't want.\n* Underestimate of the challenges in cultural difference. Xuesong Tong, vice president of TTE, said in an interview with \"China Operation\" newspaper in 2005: \"The French look down upon their Chinese boss. For example, they wanted to share the design model with TTE, but French just dislike it even though it is a popular one in US market. Also, French feel superior in their language and don't want to speak English, which created huge problem in communication. It takes hours to discuss simple issues and can't reach agreement.\"\n* According to Scott Markman, president of Monogram, Chinese companies often moved their business model to developed countries and it doesn't work. Thomson has the problem, they are very good and distribution and operation in China but France and Europe is a totally different world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Mergers and acquisitions===\nFrom 1993 to 2010, Chinese companies have been involved as either an acquiror or acquired company in 25,284 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known value of US$969 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |title=Statistics on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) \u2013 M&A Courses &#124; Company Valuation Courses &#124; Mergers & Acquisitions Courses |publisher=Imaa-institute.org |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106045040/http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_China |archive-date=6 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The number and value of deals hit a new record in 2010.

Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The [[population growth]] rate surged as the [[mortality rate]] dropped more rapidly than the [[birth rate]]. China's massive population has always been a major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major [[birth control]] program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958\u201360 was partially responsible for a huge [[Great Chinese Famine|famine]] that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second [[population control]] drive began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of [[contraceptive]]s. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second [[family planning]] program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the [[one-child policy|one child per family policy]] was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1&nbsp;billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3&nbsp;billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%.<ref>[[List of countries by population growth rate]]</ref> China's [[population growth rate]] is now among the lowest for a [[developing country]], although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly [[Population ageing|ageing]] countries in the world.\n\nFrom 100&nbsp;million to 150&nbsp;million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time, low-paying jobs.\n\nAccording to the latest [[Forbes China Rich List]] (2007), China had 66 [[billionaire]]s, the second largest number after the [[Forbes 400|United States]], which had 415.

This trend, resulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is anticipated to continue to at least 2030.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported a change in the existing law to a two-child policy, citing a statement from the Communist Party of China, and the new law is effective from 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the standing committee of the National People's Congress on 27 December 2015.<ref name=\"CNBC011913\">{{cite news |title=Chinese Labor Pool Begins to Drain |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |publisher=CNBC |date=19 January 2013 |author=Jamil Anderliniin |author2=Ed Crooks |agency=Financial Times |accessdate=8 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328064737/http://www.cnbc.com/id/100392731 |archive-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation and infrastructure==\n{{main|Transport in China}}\n\n[[File:A maglev train coming out, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Shanghai Maglev Train]]]]\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic concerns, have undergone major changes since 1949.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]: [http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926172608/http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/ |date=26 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to repair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet [[military transport]] and [[Military logistics|logistics]] needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity. During most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of regional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of international transportation was also pursued, and the scope of [[ocean shipping]] was broadened considerably.\n\n[[Freight]] [[Logistics|haulage]] is mainly provided by [[rail transport]]. The rail sector is monopolized by [[China Railway]] and there is wide variation in services provided.

This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power grids and mediocre schools.<ref>{{cite news |first1 = Vincent |last1 = Bazi |first2 = M.

The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.\n\nAs in all mining operations, the [[ore]] must usually be [[beneficiation|beneficiated]] (concentrated). The processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore. If the ore is primarily sulfide copper minerals (such as [[chalcopyrite]]), the ore is [[crusher|crushed]] and ground to liberate the valuable minerals from the waste ('gangue') minerals. It is then concentrated using mineral flotation. The concentrate is typically then sold to distant smelters, although some large mines have smelters located nearby. Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when smaller smelters could be economic. The sulfide concentrates are typically smelted in such furnaces as the Outokumpu or Inco [[flash smelting|flash furnace]] or the [[ISASMELT]] furnace to produce [[matte (metallurgy)|matte]], which must be [[Copper extraction techniques#Converting|converted]] and [[Copper extraction techniques#Fire refining|refined]] to produce anode copper. Finally, the final refining process is [[electrolysis]]. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed. [[Sulfur dioxide]] gas, for example, is captured and turned into [[sulfuric acid]] \u2014 which can then be used in the extraction process or sold for such purposes as fertiliser manufacture.\n\nOxidised copper ores can be treated by [[Copper extraction techniques#Hydrometallurgical extraction|hydrometallurgical extraction]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TamarackMiners CopperCountryMI.jpg|thumb|Miners at the [[Tamarack mine]] in [[Copper Country]], in 1905]]\nThe earliest evidence of cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at [[\u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc|\u00c7a\u00ffon\u00fc Tepesi]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Beginnings of Village-Farming Communities in Southeastern Turkey|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=68|issue=6|pages=1236\u20131240|year=1971|pmid=16591930|pmc=389161 |author1=Robert J.

The Bronze Age would not have been possible without humans developing smelting technology.\n\n==Concentration==\n{{Details|topic=copper ore body formation|Ore genesis#Copper}}{{See also|List of copper ores}}[[file:Evolution minerai cuivre.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.75|The decreasing concentration of copper in ores now requires pre-treatment of ores.]]\n\nMost copper ores contain only a small percentage of copper metal bound up within valuable [[ore]] minerals, with the remainder of the ore being unwanted rock or [[gangue]] minerals, typically [[silicate minerals]] or oxide minerals for which there is often no value. In some cases, tailings have been retreated to recover lost value as the technology for recovering copper has improved. The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.\n\nThe first stage of any process within a metallurgical treatment circuit is accurate grinding or ''[[comminution]]'', where the rock is crushed to produce small particles (<100 \u03bcm) consisting of individual mineral phases. These particles are then separated to remove gangue (rocks residues), thereafter followed by a process of physical liberation of the ore minerals from the rock. The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores.<ref>Adalbert Lossin \"Copper\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_471}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent steps do not depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper and what will be extracted. For b\nores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken, which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant. For sulfide ores, both secondary ([[supergene (geology)|supergene]]) and primary ([[hypogene]]), [[froth flotation]] is used to physically separate ore from gangue. For special native copper bearing ore bodies or sections of ore bodies rich in supergene native copper, this mineral can be recovered by a simple [[gravity separation|gravity circuit]].\n\n==Froth flotation==\n[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|left|Froth flotation cells to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]\nThe modern [[froth flotation]] process was independently invented the early 1900s in Australia by C.V Potter and around the same time by [[G. D. Delprat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd}}</ref>\n[[File:Prominenthill-flotation.jpg|thumb|left|Copper sulfide loaded air bubbles on a [[Jameson Cell]] at the flotation plant of the [[Prominent Hill]] mine in [[South Australia]]]]\n\nAll primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being [[chalcocite]]), are subjected to [[smelting]]. Some [[vat leach]] or [[pressure leach]] processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting [[leachate]] solution, but this is a minor part of the market.\n\nCarbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product produced from copper cementation plants, typically as the end-stage of a heap-leach operation. Such carbonate concentrates can be treated by a [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] (SX-EW) plant or smelted.\n\nThe copper ore is [[comminution|crushed and ground]] to a size such that an acceptably high degree of liberation has occurred between the copper sulfide ore minerals and the gangue minerals. The ore is then wetted, suspended in a slurry, and mixed with [[xanthates]] or other reagents, which render the sulfide particles [[hydrophobic]]. Typical reagents include [[potassium ethylxanthate]] and [[sodium ethylxanthate]], but [[dithiophosphate]]s and dithiocarbamates are also used.\n\nThe treated ore is introduced to a water-filled aeration tank containing [[surfactant]] such as [[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methylisobutyl carbinol]] (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry and the air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conducted to the surface, where they form a froth and are skimmed off. These skimmings are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate sent for smelting. The rock which has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as [[tailings]] or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from [[galena]]) and zinc (from [[sphalerite]]), should they exist. To improve the process efficiency, [[Lime (material)|lime]] is used to raise the [[pH]] of the water bath, causing the collector to ionize more and to preferentially bond to [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>) and avoid the [[pyrite]] (FeS<sub>2</sub>). Iron exists in both primary zone minerals. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27\u201329% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of [[pyrite]], [[sphalerite]] or [[galena]]. Chalcocite concentrates typically grade between 37% and 40% copper-in-concentrate, as chalcocite has no iron within the mineral.\n\n==Hydrometallurgical extraction==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}\n\n===Sulfide ores===\nSecondary sulfides \u2013 those formed by [[Supergene (geology)|supergene]] secondary enrichment \u2013 are resistant (''[[refractory]]'') to sulfuric leaching. These ores are a mixture of copper carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, and oxide minerals and secondary sulfide minerals, dominantly [[chalcocite]] but other minerals such as [[digenite]] can be important in some deposits.\n\nSupergene ores rich in sulfides may be concentrated using froth flotation. A typical concentrate of chalcocite can grade between 37% and 40% copper in sulfide, making them relatively cheap to smelt compared to chalcopyrite concentrates.\n\nSome supergene sulfide deposits can be leached using a [[bacterial oxidation]] heap leach process to oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid, which also allows for simultaneous leaching with sulfuric acid to produce a [[copper sulfate]] solution. As with oxide ores, [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] technologies are used to recover the copper from the [[pregnant leach solution]].\n\nSupergene sulfide ores rich in native copper minerals are refractory to treatment with sulfuric acid leaching on all practicable time scales, and the dense metal particles do not react with froth flotation media. Typically, if native copper is a minor part of a supergene profile it will not be recovered and will report to the [[tailings]]. When rich enough, native copper ore bodies may be treated to recover the contained copper via a [[gravity separation]] circuit where the density of the metal is used to liberate it from the lighter silicate minerals. Often, the nature of the gangue is important, as clay-rich native copper ores prove difficult to liberate.\n\n===Oxide ores===\nOxidised copper ore bodies may be treated via several processes, with hydrometallurgical processes used to treat oxide ores dominated by copper carbonate minerals such as [[azurite]] and [[malachite]], and other soluble minerals such as silicates like [[chrysocolla]], or sulfates such as [[atacamite]] and so on.\n\nSuch oxide ores are usually leached by [[sulfuric acid]], usually in a [[heap leaching]] or [[dump leaching]] process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with [[copper sulfate]] in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a [[solvent extraction]] and [[electrowinning]] ([[SX-EW]]) plant, with the barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called [[Cementation (metallurgy)|cementation]]. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper. Commonly sulfuric acid is used as a leachant for copper oxide, although it is possible to use water, particularly for ores rich in ultra-soluble sulfate minerals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn general, [[froth flotation]] is not used to concentrate copper oxide ores, as oxide minerals are not responsive to the froth flotation chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals). Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via froth flotation via [[sulfidation]] of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite), which can then be activated by the froth flotation plant.\n\n==Sulfide smelting==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (''primary'' copper production). Davenport, et al, noted in 2002 that even then 80% of global primary copper production was from copper\u2013iron\u2013sulfur minerals and that the vast majority of these were treated by smelting.<ref name = \"Davenport\">W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas, ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'' (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002).</ref>\n\nCopper was initially recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace.<ref>Robert Raymond, ''Out of the Fiery Furnace'', The MacMillan Company of Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, 1984.</ref> The smelters were initially located near the mines to minimize the cost of transport. This avoided the prohibitive costs of transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals. However, as the concentration of copper in the ore bodies decreased, the energy costs of smelting the whole ore also became prohibitive, and it became necessary to concentrate the ores first.\n\nInitial concentration techniques included hand-sorting<ref name = \"Gill32\">C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) p. 32</ref> and gravity concentration. They resulted in high losses of copper.

The furnace is fired with burners using pulverized coal, fuel oil or natural gas<ref name = \"Gill\">C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) pp. 29\u201335</ref> and the solid charge is melted.\n\nReverberatory furnaces can additionally be fed with molten slag from the later converting stage to recover the contained copper and other materials with a high copper content.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nBecause the reverberatory furnace bath is quiescent, very little oxidation of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is eliminated from the concentrate). It is essentially a melting process.<ref name = \"Rosenqvist\"/> Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less copper in their matte product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower copper losses to slag.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nIn the case of calcine-charged furnaces, a significant portion of the sulfur has been eliminated during the roasting stage, and the calcine consists of a mixture of copper and iron oxides and sulfides. The reverberatory furnace acts to allow these species to approach chemical equilibrium at the furnace [[operating temperature]] (approximately 1600&nbsp;\u00b0C at the burner end of the furnace and about 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C at the flue end;<ref>C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) p. 23</ref> the matte is about 1100&nbsp;\u00b0C and the slag is about 1195&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name = \"Gill\"/>). In this equilibration process, oxygen associated with copper compounds exchanges with sulfur associated with iron compounds, increasing the iron oxide content of the furnace, and the iron oxides interact with silica and other oxide materials to form the slag.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nThe main equilibration reaction is:\n\n:Cu<sub>2</sub>O + FeS = Cu<sub>2</sub>S + FeO<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nThe slag and the matte form distinct layers that can be removed from the furnace as separate streams. The slag layer is periodically allowed to flow through a hole in the wall of the furnace above the height of the matte layer. The matte is removed by draining it through a hole into ladles for it to be carried by crane to the converters.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> This draining process is known as ''tapping'' the furnace.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> The matte taphole is normally a hole through a water-cooled copper block that prevents erosion of the [[refractory|refractory bricks]] lining the furnace. When the removal of the matte or slag is complete, the hole is normally plugged with clay, which is removed when the furnace is ready to be tapped again.\n\nReverberatory furnaces were often used to treat molten converter slag to recover contained copper.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> This would be poured into the furnaces from ladles carried by cranes. However, the converter slag is high in magnetite<ref name = \"Casley\">G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, \"Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter,\" in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117\u2013138.</ref> and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the converter slag (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion.<ref name = \"Casley\"/> This accretion formation limits the quantity of converter slag that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.<ref name = \"Casley\"/>\n\nWhile reverberatory furnaces have very low copper losses to slag, they are not very energy-efficient and the low concentrations of sulfur dioxide in their offgases make its capture uneconomic.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/> Consequently, smelter operators devoted a lot of money in the 1970s and 1980s to developing new, more efficient copper smelting processes.<ref name = \"Mackey1983\">P J Mackey and P Tarassoff, \"New and emerging technologies in sulphide [sic] smelting,\" in: ''Advances in Sulfide Smelting Volume 2: Technology and Practice'', Eds H Y Sohn, D B George and A D Zunkel (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1983), 399\u2013426.</ref> In addition, flash smelting technologies had been developed in earlier years and began to replace reverberatory furnaces.

The sulfur is removed at high temperature as sulfur dioxide by blowing air through molten matte:\n:2 CuS + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CuO + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>\n\n:CuS + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 Cu + SO<sub>2</sub>\n\nIn a parallel reaction the iron sulfide is converted to slag:\n\n:2 FeS + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 FeO + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>\n:2 FeO + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>\n\nThe purity of this product is 98%, it is known as ''blister'' because of the broken surface created by the escape of sulfur dioxide gas as blister copper ''pigs'' or [[ingot]]s are cooled. By-products generated in the process are sulfur dioxide and [[slag]]. The sulfur dioxide is captured for use in earlier leaching processes.\n\n===Fire refining===\nThe blister copper is put into an [[anode furnace]], a furnace that refines the blister copper to anode-grade copper in two stages by removing most of the remaining sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as ''[[poling (metallurgy)|poling]]'' is done by blowing [[natural gas]], or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure.\n\n===Electrorefining===\n[[File:CuElectrolyticRefineApparatus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Apparatus for electrolytic refining of copper]]\n{{main|Electrowinning}}\nThe copper is refined by [[electrolysis]]. The anodes cast from processed blister copper are placed into an [[aqueous]] solution of 3\u20134% [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] and 10\u201316% [[sulfuric acid]].

The TCs are charged in US$ per tonne of concentrate treated and RCs are charged in cents per pound treated, denominated in US dollars, with benchmark prices set annually by major Japanese smelters. The customer in this case can be a smelter, who on-sells blister copper ingots to a refiner, or a smelter-refiner which is vertically integrated.\n\nOne prevalent form of copper concentrate contains gold and silver, like the one produced by Bougainville Copper Limited from the Panguna mine from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcl.com.pg/about-us/about-the-company/ |title=About the Company |accessdate=24 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182900/http://www.bcl.com.pg/about-us/about-the-company/ |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe typical contract for a miner is denominated against the London Metal Exchange price, minus the TC-RCs and any applicable penalties or credits. Penalties may be assessed against copper concentrates according to the level of deleterious elements such as [[arsenic]], [[bismuth]], [[lead]] or [[tungsten]]. Because a large portion of copper sulfide ore bodies contain [[silver]] or [[gold]] in appreciable amounts, a credit can be paid to the miner for these metals if their concentration ''within the concentrate'' is above a certain amount. Usually the refiner or smelter charges the miner a fee based on the concentration; a typical contract will specify that a credit is due for every ounce of the metal in the concentrate above a certain concentration; below that, if it is recovered, the smelter will keep the metal and sell it to defray costs.\n\nCopper concentrate is traded either via [[spot contract]]s or under long term contracts as an intermediate product in its own right. Often the smelter sells the copper metal itself on behalf of the miner. The miner is paid the price at the time that the smelter-refiner makes the sale, not at the price on the date of delivery of the concentrate. Under a Quotational Pricing system, the price is agreed to be at a fixed date in the future, typically 90 days from time of delivery to the smelter.\n\nA-grade [[copper cathode]] is of 99.99% copper in sheets that are 1&nbsp;cm thick, and approximately 1 meter square weighing approximately 200 pounds. It is a true [[commodity]], deliverable to and tradeable upon the metal exchanges in [[New York City]] (COMEX), [[London]] (London Metals Exchange) and [[Shanghai]] (Shanghai Futures Exchange). Often copper cathode is traded upon the exchanges indirectly via warrants, options, or swap contracts such that the majority of copper is traded upon the LME/COMEX/SFE but delivery is achieved directly, logistically moving the physical copper, and transferring the copper sheet from the physical warehouses themselves.\n\nThe chemical specification for [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] grade copper is ASTM B 115-00 (a standard that specifies the purity and maximum electrical resistivity of the product).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Biomining]]\n*[[:Category:Copper minerals]]\n*[[Copper mining in the United States]]\n*[[Extractive metallurgy]]\n*[[In-situ leach]]\n*[[Isasmelt]]\n*[[List of countries by copper production]]\n*[[Metallurgy]]\n*[[Smelting]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Gill, C.

The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.\n\nAs in all mining operations, the [[ore]] must usually be [[beneficiation|beneficiated]] (concentrated). The processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore. If the ore is primarily sulfide copper minerals (such as [[chalcopyrite]]), the ore is [[crusher|crushed]] and ground to liberate the valuable minerals from the waste ('gangue') minerals. It is then concentrated using mineral flotation. The concentrate is typically then sold to distant smelters, although some large mines have smelters located nearby. Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when smaller smelters could be economic. The sulfide concentrates are typically smelted in such furnaces as the Outokumpu or Inco [[flash smelting|flash furnace]] or the [[ISASMELT]] furnace to produce [[matte (metallurgy)|matte]], which must be [[Copper extraction techniques#Converting|converted]] and [[Copper extraction techniques#Fire refining|refined]] to produce anode copper. Finally, the final refining process is [[electrolysis]]. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed. [[Sulfur dioxide]] gas, for example, is captured and turned into [[sulfuric acid]] \u2014 which can then be used in the extraction process or sold for such purposes as fertiliser manufacture.\n\nOxidised copper ores can be treated by [[Copper extraction techniques#Hydrometallurgical extraction|hydrometallurgical extraction]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:TamarackMiners CopperCountryMI.jpg|thumb|Miners at the [[Tamarack mine]] in [[Copper Country]], in 1905]]\nThe earliest evidence of cold-hammering of native copper comes from the excavation at [[\u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc|\u00c7a\u00ffon\u00fc Tepesi]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], which dates between 7200 to 6600 BCE.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Beginnings of Village-Farming Communities in Southeastern Turkey|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=68|issue=6|pages=1236\u20131240|year=1971|pmid=16591930|pmc=389161 |author1=Robert J.

The Bronze Age would not have been possible without humans developing smelting technology.\n\n==Concentration==\n{{Details|topic=copper ore body formation|Ore genesis#Copper}}{{See also|List of copper ores}}[[file:Evolution minerai cuivre.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.75|The decreasing concentration of copper in ores now requires pre-treatment of ores.]]\n\nMost copper ores contain only a small percentage of copper metal bound up within valuable [[ore]] minerals, with the remainder of the ore being unwanted rock or [[gangue]] minerals, typically [[silicate minerals]] or oxide minerals for which there is often no value. In some cases, tailings have been retreated to recover lost value as the technology for recovering copper has improved. The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.\n\nThe first stage of any process within a metallurgical treatment circuit is accurate grinding or ''[[comminution]]'', where the rock is crushed to produce small particles (<100 \u03bcm) consisting of individual mineral phases. These particles are then separated to remove gangue (rocks residues), thereafter followed by a process of physical liberation of the ore minerals from the rock. The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores.<ref>Adalbert Lossin \"Copper\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_471}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper and what will be extracted. For oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken, which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant. For sulfide ores, both secondary ([[supergene (geology)|supergene]]) and primary ([[hypogene]]), [[froth flotation]] is used to physically separate ore from gangue. For special native copper bearing ore bodies or sections of ore bodies rich in supergene native copper, this mineral can be recovered by a simple [[gravity separation|gravity circuit]].\n\n==Froth flotation==\n[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|left|Froth flotation cells to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]\nThe modern [[froth flotation]] process was independently invented the early 1900s in Australia by C.V Potter and around the same time by [[G. D. Delprat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd}}</ref>\n[[File:Prominenthill-flotation.jpg|thumb|left|Copper sulfide loaded air bubbles on a [[Jameson Cell]] at the flotation plant of the [[Prominent Hill]] mine in [[South Australia]]]]\n\nAll primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being [[chalcocite]]), are subjected to [[smelting]]. Some [[vat leach]] or [[pressure leach]] processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting [[leachate]] solution, but this is a minor part of the market.\n\nCarbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product produced from copper cementation plants, typically as the end-stage of a heap-leach operation. Such carbonate concentrates can be treated by a [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] (SX-EW) plant or smelted.\n\nThe copper ore is [[comminution|crushed and ground]] to a size such that an acceptably high degree of liberation has occurred between the copper sulfide ore minerals and the gangue minerals. The ore is then wetted, suspended in a slurry, and mixed with [[xanthates]] or other reagents, which render the sulfide particles [[hydrophobic]]. Typical reagents include [[potassium ethylxanthate]] and [[sodium ethylxanthate]], but [[dithiophosphate]]s and dithiocarbamates are also used.\n\nThe treated ore is introduced to a water-filled aeration tank containing [[surfactant]] such as [[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methylisobutyl carbinol]] (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry and the air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conducted to the surface, where they form a froth and are skimmed off. These skimmings are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate sent for smelting. The rock which has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as [[tailings]] or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from [[galena]]) and zinc (from [[sphalerite]]), should they exist. To improve the process efficiency, [[Lime (material)|lime]] is used to raise the [[pH]] of the water bath, causing the collector to ionize more and to preferentially bond to [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>) and avoid the [[pyrite]] (FeS<sub>2</sub>). Iron exists in both primary zone minerals. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27\u201329% copper); the remainder of the concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of [[pyrite]], [[sphalerite]] or [[galena]]. Chalcocite concentrates typically grade between 37% and 40% copper-in-concentrate, as chalcocite has no iron within the mineral.\n\n==Hydrometallurgical extraction==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}\n\n===Sulfide ores===\nSecondary sulfides \u2013 those formed by [[Supergene (geology)|supergene]] secondary enrichment \u2013 are resistant (''[[refractory]]'') to sulfuric leaching. These ores are a mixture of copper carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, and oxide minerals and secondary sulfide minerals, dominantly [[chalcocite]] but other minerals such as [[digenite]] can be important in some deposits.\n\nSupergene ores rich in sulfides may be concentrated using froth flotation. A typical concentrate of chalcocite can grade between 37% and 40% copper in sulfide, making them relatively cheap to smelt compared to chalcopyrite concentrates.\n\nSome supergene sulfide deposits can be leached using a [[bacterial oxidation]] heap leach process to oxidize the sulfides to sulfuric acid, which also allows for simultaneous leaching with sulfuric acid to produce a [[copper sulfate]] solution. As with oxide ores, [[solvent extraction and electrowinning]] technologies are used to recover the copper from the [[pregnant leach solution]].\n\nSupergene sulfide ores rich in native copper minerals are refractory to treatment with sulfuric acid leaching on all practicable time scales, and the dense metal particles do not react with froth flotation media. Typically, if native copper is a minor part of a supergene profile it will not be recovered and will report to the [[tailings]]. When rich enough, native copper ore bodies may be treated to recover the contained copper via a [[gravity separation]] circuit where the density of the metal is used to liberate it from the lighter silicate minerals. Often, the nature of the gangue is important, as clay-rich native copper ores prove difficult to liberate.\n\n===Oxide ores===\nOxidised copper ore bodies may be treated via several processes, with hydrometallurgical processes used to treat oxide ores dominated by copper carbonate minerals such as [[azurite]] and [[malachite]], and other soluble minerals such as silicates like [[chrysocolla]], or sulfates such as [[atacamite]] and so on.\n\nSuch oxide ores are usually leached by [[sulfuric acid]], usually in a [[heap leaching]] or [[dump leaching]] process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with [[copper sulfate]] in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a [[solvent extraction]] and [[electrowinning]] ([[SX-EW]]) plant, with the barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the pregnant solution by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called [[Cementation (metallurgy)|cementation]]. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper. Commonly sulfuric acid is used as a leachant for copper oxide, although it is possible to use water, particularly for ores rich in ultra-soluble sulfate minerals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn general, [[froth flotation]] is not used to concentrate copper oxide ores, as oxide minerals are not responsive to the froth flotation chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals). Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via froth flotation via [[sulfidation]] of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite), which can then be activated by the froth flotation plant.\n\n==Sulfide smelting==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (''primary'' copper production). Davenport, et al, noted in 2002 that even then 80% of global primary copper production was from copper\u2013iron\u2013sulfur minerals and that the vast majority of these were treated by smelting.<ref name = \"Davenport\">W G Davenport, M King, M Schlesinger and A K Biswas, ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Fourth Edition'' (Elsevier Science Limited: Kidlington, Oxford, England, 2002).</ref>\n\nCopper was initially recovered from sulfide ores by directly smelting the ore in a furnace.<ref>Robert Raymond, ''Out of the Fiery Furnace'', The MacMillan Company of Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, 1984.</ref> The smelters were initially located near the mines to minimize the cost of transport. This avoided the prohibitive costs of transporting the waste minerals and the sulfur and iron present in the copper-containing minerals. However, as the concentration of copper in the ore bodies decreased, the energy costs of smelting the whole ore also became prohibitive, and it became necessary to concentrate the ores first.\n\nInitial concentration techniques included hand-sorting<ref name = \"Gill32\">C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) p. 32</ref> and gravity concentration.

Above this figure, oxidic copper begins to dominate.<ref name = \"Nagamori\"/>\n\nThe loss of copper as prills suspended in the slag depends on the size of the prills, the viscosity of the slag and the settling time available.<ref name = \"Rosenqvist\"/> Rosenqvist suggested that about half the copper losses to slag were due to suspended prills.<ref name = \"Rosenqvist\">T Rosenqvist, T (2004) ''Principles of Extractive Metallurgy, Second Edition'', Tapir Academic Press: Trondheim, p. 331, {{ISBN|8251919223}}.</ref>\n\nThe mass of slag generated in the smelting stage depends on the iron content of the material fed into the smelting furnace and the target matte grade. The greater the iron content of the feed, the more iron that will need to be rejected to the slag for a given matte grade. Similarly, increasing the target matte grade requires the rejection of more iron and an increase in the slag volume.\n\nThus, the two factors that most affect the loss of copper to slag in the smelting stage are:\n* matte grade\n* mass of slag.<ref name = \"Hayes173\"/>\n\nThis means that there is a practical limit on how high the matte grade can be if the loss of copper to slag is to be minimized. Therefore, further stages of processing (converting and fire refining) are required.\n\nThe following subsections briefly describe some of the processes used in matte smelting.\n\n====Reverberatory furnace smelting====\n\nReverberatory furnaces are long furnaces can treat wet, dry or roasted concentrate.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/> Most of the reverberatory furnaces used in the latter years treated roasted concentrate because putting dry feed materials into the reverberatory furnace is more energy efficient, and because the elimination of some of the sulfur in the roaster results in higher matte grades.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/>\n\nThe reverberatory furnace feed is added to the furnace through feed holes along the sides of the furnace.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/> Additional silica is normally added to help form the slag. The furnace is fired with burners using pulverized coal, fuel oil or natural gas<ref name = \"Gill\">C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) pp. 29\u201335</ref> and the solid charge is melted.\n\nReverberatory furnaces can additionally be fed with molten slag from the later converting stage to recover the contained copper and other materials with a high copper content.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nBecause the reverberatory furnace bath is quiescent, very little oxidation of the feed occurs (and thus very little sulfur is eliminated from the concentrate). It is essentially a melting process.<ref name = \"Rosenqvist\"/> Consequently, wet-charged reverberatory furnaces have less copper in their matte product than calcine-charged furnaces, and they also have lower copper losses to slag.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nIn the case of calcine-charged furnaces, a significant portion of the sulfur has been eliminated during the roasting stage, and the calcine consists of a mixture of copper and iron oxides and sulfides. The reverberatory furnace acts to allow these species to approach chemical equilibrium at the furnace [[operating temperature]] (approximately 1600&nbsp;\u00b0C at the burner end of the furnace and about 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C at the flue end;<ref>C B Gill, ''Non-ferrous Extractive Metallurgy'' (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1980) p. 23</ref> the matte is about 1100&nbsp;\u00b0C and the slag is about 1195&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name = \"Gill\"/>). In this equilibration process, oxygen associated with copper compounds exchanges with sulfur associated with iron compounds, increasing the iron oxide content of the furnace, and the iron oxides interact with silica and other oxide materials to form the slag.<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nThe main equilibration reaction is:\n\n:Cu<sub>2</sub>O + FeS = Cu<sub>2</sub>S + FeO<ref name = \"Gill\"/>\n\nThe slag and the matte form distinct layers that can be removed from the furnace as separate streams. The slag layer is periodically allowed to flow through a hole in the wall of the furnace above the height of the matte layer. The matte is removed by draining it through a hole into ladles for it to be carried by crane to the converters.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> This draining process is known as ''tapping'' the furnace.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> The matte taphole is normally a hole through a water-cooled copper block that prevents erosion of the [[refractory|refractory bricks]] lining the furnace. When the removal of the matte or slag is complete, the hole is normally plugged with clay, which is removed when the furnace is ready to be tapped again.\n\nReverberatory furnaces were often used to treat molten converter slag to recover contained copper.<ref name = \"Gill\"/> This would be poured into the furnaces from ladles carried by cranes. However, the converter slag is high in magnetite<ref name = \"Casley\">G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, \"Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter,\" in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117\u2013138.</ref> and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the converter slag (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion.<ref name = \"Casley\"/> This accretion formation limits the quantity of converter slag that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.<ref name = \"Casley\"/>\n\nWhile reverberatory furnaces have very low copper losses to slag, they are not very energy-efficient and the low concentrations of sulfur dioxide in their offgases make its capture uneconomic.<ref name = \"Davenport\"/> Consequently, smelter operators devoted a lot of money in the 1970s and 1980s to developing new, more efficient copper smelting processes.<ref name = \"Mackey1983\">P J Mackey and P Tarassoff, \"New and emerging technologies in sulphide [sic] smelting,\" in: ''Advances in Sulfide Smelting Volume 2: Technology and Practice'', Eds H Y Sohn, D B George and A D Zunkel (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1983), 399\u2013426.</ref> In addition, flash smelting technologies had been developed in earlier years and began to replace reverberatory furnaces.

The sulfur is removed at high temperature as sulfur dioxide by blowing air through molten matte:\n:2 CuS + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CuO + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>\n\n:CuS + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 Cu + SO<sub>2</sub>\n\nIn a parallel reaction the iron sulfide is converted to slag:\n\n:2 FeS + 3 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 FeO + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>\n:2 FeO + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>\n\nThe purity of this product is 98%, it is known as ''blister'' because of the broken surface created by the escape of sulfur dioxide gas as blister copper ''pigs'' or [[ingot]]s are cooled. By-products generated in the process are sulfur dioxide and [[slag]]. The sulfur dioxide is captured for use in earlier leaching processes.\n\n===Fire refining===\nThe blister copper is put into an [[anode furnace]], a furnace that refines the blister copper to anode-grade copper in two stages by removing most of the remaining sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as ''[[poling (metallurgy)|poling]]'' is done by blowing [[natural gas]], or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure.\n\n===Electrorefining===\n[[File:CuElectrolyticRefineApparatus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Apparatus for electrolytic refining of copper]]\n{{main|Electrowinning}}\nThe copper is refined by [[electrolysis]]. The anodes cast from processed blister copper are placed into an [[aqueous]] solution of 3\u20134% [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] and 10\u201316% [[sulfuric acid]].

The TCs are charged in US$ per tonne of concentrate treated and RCs are charged in cents per pound treated, denominated in US dollars, with benchmark prices set annually by major Japanese smelters. The customer in this case can be a smelter, who on-sells blister copper ingots to a refiner, or a smelter-refiner which is vertically integrated.\n\nOne prevalent form of copper concentrate contains gold and silver, like the one produced by Bougainville Copper Limited from the Panguna mine from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcl.com.pg/about-us/about-the-company/ |title=About the Company |accessdate=24 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182900/http://www.bcl.com.pg/about-us/about-the-company/ |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe typical contract for a miner is denominated against the London Metal Exchange price, minus the TC-RCs and any applicable penalties or credits. Penalties may be assessed against copper concentrates according to the level of deleterious elements such as [[arsenic]], [[bismuth]], [[lead]] or [[tungsten]]. Because a large portion of copper sulfide ore bodies contain [[silver]] or [[gold]] in appreciable amounts, a credit can be paid to the miner for these metals if their concentration ''within the concentrate'' is above a certain amount. Usually the refiner or smelter charges the miner a fee based on the concentration; a typical contract will specify that a credit is due for every ounce of the metal in the concentrate above a certain concentration; below that, if it is recovered, the smelter will keep the metal and sell it to defray costs.\n\nCopper concentrate is traded either via [[spot contract]]s or under long term contracts as an intermediate product in its own right. Often the smelter sells the copper metal itself on behalf of the miner. The miner is paid the price at the time that the smelter-refiner makes the sale, not at the price on the date of delivery of the concentrate. Under a Quotational Pricing system, the price is agreed to be at a fixed date in the future, typically 90 days from time of delivery to the smelter.\n\nA-grade [[copper cathode]] is of 99.99% copper in sheets that are 1&nbsp;cm thick, and approximately 1 meter square weighing approximately 200 pounds. It is a true [[commodity]], deliverable to and tradeable upon the metal exchanges in [[New York City]] (COMEX), [[London]] (London Metals Exchange) and [[Shanghai]] (Shanghai Futures Exchange). Often copper cathode is traded upon the exchanges indirectly via warrants, options, or swap contracts such that the majority of copper is traded upon the LME/COMEX/SFE but delivery is achieved directly, logistically moving the physical copper, and transferring the copper sheet from the physical warehouses themselves.\n\nThe chemical specification for [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] grade copper is ASTM B 115-00 (a standard that specifies the purity and maximum electrical resistivity of the product).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Biomining]]\n*[[:Category:Copper minerals]]\n*[[Copper mining in the United States]]\n*[[Extractive metallurgy]]\n*[[In-situ leach]]\n*[[Isasmelt]]\n*[[List of countries by copper production]]\n*[[Metallurgy]]\n*[[Smelting]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Gill, C.
