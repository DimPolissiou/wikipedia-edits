Hydroelectric generators, due to their massive size, developed enough centrifugal force to make the power mains frequency extremely stable, so circuits were developed for television cameras to lock onto that frequency as their primary reference.  \n\nThe introduction of color television technology made it necessary to lower that 60 FPS frequency by 0.1% to avoid \"[[dot crawl]]\", an annoying display artifact appearing on legacy black-and-white displays, showing up on highly-color-saturated surfaces. It was found that by lowering the frame rate by 0.1%, the undesirable effect was minimized.  \n\nToday, video transmission standards in North America, Japan, and South Korea are still based on 60\u00f71.001 or \u224859.94 images per second. Two sizes of images are typically used: 1920\u00d7540 (1080i) and 1280\u00d7720 (720p). Confusingly, ''interlaced'' formats are customarily stated at 1/2 their image rate, 29.97 FPS, and ''double'' their image height, but these statements are purely custom; in each format, 60 images per second are produced. 1080i produces 59.94 1920\u00d7540 images, each squashed to half-height in the photographic process, and stretched back to fill the screen on playback in a television set. The 720p format produces 59.94 1280\u00d7720 images, not squeezed, so that no expansion or squeezing of the image is necessary. This confusion was industry-wide in the early days of digital video software, with much software being written incorrectly, the coders believing that only 29.97 images were expected each second, which was incorrect. While it was true that each picture element was polled and sent only 29.97 times per second, the pixel location immediately below that one was polled 1/60 of a second later, part of a completely separate image for the next 1/60-second frame.  \n\nFilm, at its native 24 FPS rate could not be displayed without the necessary [[Three-two pull down|pulldown]] process, often leading to \"judder\": To convert 24 frames per second into 60 frames per second, every odd frame is repeated, playing twice, while every even frame is tripled. This creates uneven motion, appearing stroboscopic. Other conversions have similar uneven frame doubling. Newer video standards support 120, 240, or 300 frames per second, so frames can be evenly multiplied for common frame rates such as 24 FPS film and 30 FPS video, as well as 25 and 50 FPS video in the case of 300 FPS displays. These standards also support video that is natively in higher frame rates, and video with [[Motion interpolation|interpolated]] frames between its native frames.<ref>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP169.pdf High Frame-Rate Television], BBC White Paper WHP 169, September 2008, M Armstrong, D Flynn, M Hammond, PAWAN Jahajpuria S Jolly, R Salmon</ref> Some modern films are experimenting with frame rates higher than 24 FPS, such as 48 and 60 FPS.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/27/avatar-sequels-to-shoot-at-48fps/|title=James Cameron's 'Avatar' sequels will stick to 48 frames per second|author=Jon Fingas|date=November 27, 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrame rate in electronic camera specifications may refer to the maximal possible frames per second, where, in practice, other settings (such as exposure time) may reduce the frequency to a lower number.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Delta timing]]\n*[[Federal Standard 1037C]]\n*[[Film-out]]\n*[[Flicker fusion threshold]]\n*[[Glossary of video terms]]\n*[[High frame rate]]\n*[[List of film formats]]\n*[[MIL-STD-188]]\n*[[Movie projector]]\n*[[Moving image formats]]\n*[[Time-lapse photography]]\n*[[Video compression]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801070523/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/TempRate.mspx \"Temporal Rate Conversion\"]\u2014a very detailed guide about the visual interference of TV, video & PC\n([[Wayback Machine]] copy)\n* [https://www.testufo.com/ Motion Tests] \u2014 visually comparing multiple framerates\n\n{{Video processing}}\n{{Graphics Processing Unit}}\n{{Compression methods}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frame Rate}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish-redirect|Update rate|RAM update rate}}\n{{distinguish-redirect|Burst rate|Burstable rate}}\n'''Frame rate''' (expressed in '''{{vanchor|frames per second}}''' or '''FPS''') is the [[frequency]] (rate) at which consecutive [[image]]s called [[Film frame|frame]]s appear on a display.

Hydroelectric generators, due to their massive size, developed enough centrifugal force to make the power mains frequency extremely stable, so circuits were developed for television cameras to lock onto that frequency as their primary reference.  \n\nThe introduction of color television technology made it necessary to lower that 60 FPS frequency by .1% to avoid \"[[dot crawl]]\", an annoying display artifact appearing on legacy black-and-white displays, showing up on highly-color-saturated surfaces. It was found that by lowering the frame rate by .1%, the undesirable effect was minimized.  \n\nToday, video transmission standards in North America, Japan, and South Korea are still based on 60\u00f71.001 or \u224859.94 images per second. Two sizes of images are typically used: 1920\u00d7540 (1080i) and 1280\u00d7720 (720p). Confusingly, ''interlaced'' formats are customarily stated at 1/2 their image rate, 29.97 FPS, and ''double'' their image height, but these statements are purely custom; in each format, 60 images per second are produced. 1080i produces 59.94 1920\u00d7540 images, each squashed to half-height in the photographic process, and stretched back to fill the screen on playback in a television set. The 720p format produces 59.94 1280\u00d7720 images, not squeezed, so that no expansion or squeezing of the image is necessary. This confusion was industry-wide in the early days of digital video software, with much software being written incorrectly, the coders believing that only 29.97 images were expected each second, which was incorrect. While it was true that each picture element was polled and sent only 29.97 times per second, the pixel location immediately below that one was polled 1/60 of a second later, part of a completely separate image for the next 1/60-second frame.  \n\nFilm, at its native 24 FPS rate could not be displayed without the necessary [[Three-two pull down|pulldown]] process, often leading to \"judder\": To convert 24 frames per second into 60 frames per second, every odd frame is repeated, playing twice, while every even frame is tripled. This creates uneven motion, appearing stroboscopic. Other conversions have similar uneven frame doubling. Newer video standards support 120, 240, or 300 frames per second, so frames can be evenly multiplied for common frame rates such as 24 FPS film and 30 FPS video, as well as 25 and 50 FPS video in the case of 300 FPS displays. These standards also support video that is natively in higher frame rates, and video with [[Motion interpolation|interpolated]] frames between its native frames.<ref>[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP169.pdf High Frame-Rate Television], BBC White Paper WHP 169, September 2008, M Armstrong, D Flynn, M Hammond, PAWAN Jahajpuria S Jolly, R Salmon</ref> Some modern films are experimenting with frame rates higher than 24 FPS, such as 48 and 60 FPS.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/27/avatar-sequels-to-shoot-at-48fps/|title=James Cameron's 'Avatar' sequels will stick to 48 frames per second|author=Jon Fingas|date=November 27, 2014|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrame rate in electronic camera specifications may refer to the maximal possible frames per second, where, in practice, other settings (such as exposure time) may reduce the frequency to a lower number.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Delta timing]]\n*[[Federal Standard 1037C]]\n*[[Film-out]]\n*[[Flicker fusion threshold]]\n*[[Glossary of video terms]]\n*[[High frame rate]]\n*[[List of film formats]]\n*[[MIL-STD-188]]\n*[[Movie projector]]\n*[[Moving image formats]]\n*[[Time-lapse photography]]\n*[[Video compression]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801070523/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/TempRate.mspx \"Temporal Rate Conversion\"]\u2014a very detailed guide about the visual interference of TV, video & PC\n([[Wayback Machine]] copy)\n* [https://www.testufo.com/ Motion Tests] \u2014 visually comparing multiple framerates\n\n{{Video processing}}\n{{Graphics Processing Unit}}\n{{Compression methods}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frame Rate}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "name_user": "Catslash", "label": "safe", "comment": "Modern video standards: \".1%\" \u2192 \"0.1%\" \u00d7 2 in order to clearly distinguish it from \"1%\" (MOS:DECIMAL)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate"}

Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone

It was first noted as a developing tropical low within a trough of low pressure during April 1, while it was located to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Over the next day, the system moved south-eastwards over the [[Solomon Sea]], before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Harold by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\nHarold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now

It stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, [[Sigourney Weaver]], Ramis, [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ernie Hudson]], and [[Annie Potts]]. It is the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the second film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the demi-god [[Gozer]]. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters reform to combat it and save the world.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of ''Ghostbusters'', [[Columbia Pictures]] wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30\u201340 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed compared to the original film's 13-month cycle; large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on June 16, 1989, to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of [[Peter MacNicol]] and Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original's $282.2 million, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, the effect of which dissuaded Murray from participating in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film. Its soundtrack single, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]]\" by [[Bobby Brown]], was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.\n\nThe film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Ghostbusters''. Although some retrospective audiences praised it, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is generally seen as a poor follow-up to ''Ghostbusters'' and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], music, toys, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]]. Despite the relative failure of ''Ghostbusters II'', a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. A financially unsuccessful and controversial [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 series reboot]] led to renewed efforts on a direct sequel, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', which is scheduled for release in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after saving New York City from destruction by the demigod [[Gozer]], the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Raymond Stantz owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children's entertainers. Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions, and Peter Venkman hosts a television show about psychics.\n\nDana Barrett, Peter's ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum cleaning paintings. She turns to the Ghostbusters for help after Oscar's [[baby transport|baby stroller]] rolls, seemingly by itself, into a busy road intersection. At the museum, a portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, a brutal, sixteenth-century tyrant and powerful magician, comes to life and enslaves Dana's boss Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar's stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system. Raymond obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally kicks a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. In the courtroom, the slime sample is presented as evidence. It responds physically to judge Wexler's angry tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, summoning the ghosts of two brothers he sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the revocation of the order banning them from operating.\n\nOne night, the slime invades Dana's apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner, Egon, Raymond, and Winston explore the underground river of slime and are pulled in. They begin fighting until Egon realizes they are being influenced by the slime. They determine that the river of slime flows to the museum.\n\nThe Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their suspicions but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's political interests. A spirit in the form of Janosz kidnaps Oscar and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime. On [[New Year's Eve]], the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread chaos. Learning of Hardemeyer's actions, the mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released. \n\nDetermining the need for a positive symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively charged slime to animate the [[Statue of Liberty]] and pilot it through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the museum's slime covering partially recedes and they use the Statue's torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from completing his possession of Oscar.\n\nThe ghostbusters rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", and their positivity weakens Vigo. He is forced to return to the painting and the Ghostbusters are freed. Vigo possesses Raymond, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and destroy Vigo, his portrait being replaced by their likenesses surrounding Oscar. In the aftermath, the Ghostbusters are cheered by the city and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.\n\n==Cast ==\n{{main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1989 Cast.png|thumb|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis|Stars of the film include (l\u2013r, top row) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], (bottom row) [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Rick Moranis]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz|Raymond Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Janosz Poha\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Jack Hardemeyer\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mayor Lenny Clotch\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Judge Stephen Wexler\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as the Prosecutor\n* William T.

He favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987) and the comedy film ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1989) over big-budget blockbusters. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the \"world market\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' was part of former Columbia executive [[Frank Price]]'s legacy, and Puttnam would have had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nReitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam's fault and that executives above Puttnam at Columbia's New York branch had attempted to work around him because they thought he was holding up the project, but they discovered they could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"VultureControl\"/>\n\nIn April 1987, Puttnam announced that ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script.<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/><ref name=\"LooperDunno\"/> Puttnam was removed from his job in September 1987. It was reported that this was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray for making millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving \"back to his art. He\u2019s a taker.\"<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> He also attacked expensive talent agency packages that provided scripts, directors, and stars; Ovitz also represented Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman.<ref name=\"THRPuttnam\"/>  \n\nPuttnam was replaced as Columbia president by [[Dawn Steel]].<ref name=\"NYTimesJan1990\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> When she took the job, her corporate bosses made it clear that getting the sequel into production was a priority.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Columbia had experienced a long series of box-office failures since ''Ghostbusters'', and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as the best way of reversing their fortunes.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> By November 1987, filming was scheduled to begin in summer the following year. At the time, Murray reportedly wanted $10 million to star in the sequel and his co-stars demanded an equal amount.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribFilmingSched\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nThe main obstacle was the disputes between the principal cast and crew that had arisen since ''Ghostbusters''. Ramis later said, \"there was a little air to clear\" before they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> In March 1988,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz's colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy's, a celebrity restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had experienced a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> \n\nMonths of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, \"it's a big one\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> This was done to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> After this, the film was rushed into production, with filming scheduled for summer 1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/> Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had a shorter schedule than its predecessor's one-year turnaround.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} [[Michael C.

Early on, they decided ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=57}} Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana's relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|pp=57,58}} Instead, they chose to have Peter's and Dana's relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}}\n\nThe river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the build-up of negative human emotions in large cities;{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}}{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} he considered it a metaphor for [[urban decay]] and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} Ramis said; \"Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?\".<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}} He said; \"cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to{{nbsp}}... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} The story evolved far from Ramis' and Aykroyd's combined efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year,<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/> and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nIn the years since the release of the more adult-oriented ''Ghostbusters'', its animated spin-off television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' had become popular with its target child audience. The team were tasked with balancing the needs of ''Ghostbusters'' fans and those of the cartoon's audience.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> According to Medjuck, the cartoon's success was influential in the return of [[Slimer]] for the sequel, and they aimed to avoid contradicting the cartoon where possible; he said although the Ghostbusters have been out of work for five years, they had to act as though the cartoon's events took place after the film.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/> \n\n===Cast===\n[[File:Max von Sydow Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A profile image of Max von Sydow.

He described ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt \"radioactive\" after the failure of his personal project ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"CSTEbert\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for \"greed\" or \"business\" reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence.

When he wrote the scene, Ramis expected the production to use a manhole, but the only available underground location was a telephone conduit.

Edlund's former ILM co-worker [[Dennis Muren]] served as the visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Despite the film's intentionally rushed schedule, Muren wanted to work on the film because it would let him design new creatures.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Muren admitted that his designs would not be as original as ''Ghostbusters''{{'}}, and instead wanted to make them more flexible and \"ghostly\".<ref name=\"NYTimesEffects\"/> The team were originally hired to provide 110 effects shots but this grew to 180.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nILM was also working on special effects for other 1989 releases; ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', and ''[[The Abyss]]'', but had the most difficulty with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' because designs and concepts were constantly changing and new scenes were being added. ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots,{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited [[Tippett Studio]].<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Slime===\nMethocel, a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]] mocked up differently colored batches and Reitman settled on pink.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The film required approximately {{convert|100,000|USgal|l|sp=us|abbr=off}} of slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} [[Mica]] dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}}\n\nThe river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough {{convert|1|foot|meter|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} long. It operated in a [[Pump#Gravity pumps|gravity pump]] and was fed from a large tank {{convert|15|feet|meters|abbr=on}} above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered [[Slosh dynamics|baffles]] were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=9, 10}} Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in's boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson's character being dragged away by the slime's current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river's natural movements.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Creature effects===\nThe returning Slimer ghost was re-developed to be more child-friendly like his popular ''The Real Ghostbusters'' incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in ''Ghostbusters'', was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=21}} \n\nThe Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis' father's store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film's scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters' evil rather than their pre-death appearances.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}} Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe ghosts' faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} The brothers' electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through [[mylar]] material that could be warped to affect the underlying image.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=18}} For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar's team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=13,14}} Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}} ''Ghostbusters'' storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he \"could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}}\n\n[[File:116 NYC (Liberty Island).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Statue of Liberty as seen from below. The green statue is a female figure wearing a toga and crowd, while holding a torch above in her right hand. There is a blue sky and white clouds behind it. |The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a prominent feature in the film's finale. [[Dan Aykroyd]] liked the idea of animating something otherwise immobile.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}]]\n\nThe animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] moving or [[Victoria Falls]] flowing in reverse.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The statue's role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=34}} The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue's crown\u2014 which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a [[gimbal]], allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=41}} Fye also portrayed the ghost of a [[Central Park]] jogger.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=20}}\n\nTo portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights off Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol's head while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol's gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The \"ghost nanny\" version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman's apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon\u2014an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal\u2014billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and [[Santa Claus]].{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} MacNicol wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost's extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=26,27}} \n\nWelch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman's apartment to scale; it was positioned {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}\n\nThe [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the ''Titanic'' with slightly modified aspects; the position of the ship's name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car but there was no time to find a suitable model and an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in [[stop motion]] by [[Phil Tippett]], who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}}\n\n===Vigo the Carpathian===\n[[File:Ghostbusters II Vigo Painting.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An image of Wilhelm von Homburg in character as Vigo the Carpathian.

Eytchison specialized in ''[[Tableau vivant]]s''\u2014the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said while they could have figured out the concept, they did not have enough time and needed an expert. The aim was to portray what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting's look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to \"[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan [the Barbarian]]]\".<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period's painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nEytchison's team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Eytchison's team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg's  costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nOnce the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch's department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=7\u20139}} Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg's disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Another concept had him \"peel\" from the canvas,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}} A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by [[Harold Weed]] as the possessed version of Aykroyd's character.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{see also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\n''Ghostbusters''{{'}} hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters' equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in an uncredited role. Dane revised the designs of the [[proton pack]] weapons, the ghost trap, and also revised the Ectomobile, which became the Ectomobile 1A. Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower\u2014a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle. He re-purposed leftover prop warning labels and symbols from his work on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) to make the equipment look more authentic.<ref name=\"BTMSep14Dane\"/>\n\nThe slime blower weapons were three times heavier than the proton packs; the tanks did not contain slime, which was pumped through the guns from off-camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}} The bulky proton packs, which were considered heavy and uncomfortable during the filming of ''Ghostbusters'', were redesigned to weigh {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in comparison with the {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}} versions used on the previous film. The new design offered more comfort while removing some of the powered effects.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Muren's team redesigned the proton pack neutrino wand beams to be multi-functional, allowing them to be used as lassos or fishing lines to capture ghosts instead of being straight beams.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Five remotely controlled baby strollers were used to create the possessed stroller in the film's opening; motors and driveshafts were concealed with the stroller's chrome body, and brakes that could stop it immediately or slow it gradually were used.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Gaspar employed two-time national miniature-car champion Jay Halsey to drive the stroller; he had to weave it between traffic from up to {{convert|75|feet|meters|abbr=on}} away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}}\n\n==Release==\nIn the late 1980s, film sequels were still quite rare, but the concept of the media franchise had quickly developed following the success of the original ''[[Star Wars Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' trilogy.<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/> In 1989, more sequels were released than in any previous year, including ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'', ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', and ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimesMay89\"/> Also released that year were original hits that would become popular classics like ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', and ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.<ref name=\"NYPostJul14\"/> That year's most anticipated film was ''Batman'', which was scheduled for release a week after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', and whose logo had become ubiquitous through a significant marketing campaign aided by its mega-congomlerate owner [[Time-Warner]].<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/><ref name=\"THRJun19\"/><ref name=\"MentalFlossMar19\"/> Shortly before its release, a \"major theater chain\" executive said they expected ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' to make approximately $150 million during its run, behind ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($225 million) and ''Batman'' ($175 million), and ahead of ''Lethal Weapon 2'' ($100 million).<ref name=\"LATimesJun81989\"/>\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was originally scheduled for release in July 1989 but less than three months before release, it was brought forward to June to avoid direct competition with ''Batman''.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The premiere of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' took place on June 15, 1989, at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], with an after-party that required payment to attend at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]; the entrance fees collected were donated to [[Saint John's Health Center]].<ref name=\"LATimesJun191989\"/> \n\n===Box office===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' received a wide release on June 16, 1989, in 2,410 theaters, compared with the original film's opening on 1,339.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"LATimesJun89\"/> Compared to ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} $13{{nbsp}}million opening weekend, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' film earned $29.5{{nbsp}}million\u2014an average of $12,229 per theater\u2014as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the action-adventure film ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($11.7{{nbsp}}million) which was in its fourth week of release and drama film ''Dead Poets Society'' ($9.1{{nbsp}}million), which was in its third.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"BOMOpeningWKND\"/> Based on its gross and an average increase in ticket price of 22% since ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} release, an estimated 2{{nbsp}}million more people went to see the film's opening.

Benson called them \"impressive\", and Caroll highlighted moments like the ghostly, resurrected ''Titanic'', but she felt that the creatures lacked any real menace.<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} ''Variety'' said the film's slime and visuals would appeal to children, while adults could appreciate the witty dialogue.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Ghostbusters'', reviewers were more conflicted over Murray's performance in the sequel.<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Kehr said that his performance retained \"bright\" moments, but he seemed less energetic than in his previous film ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/> Rosenbaum concurred, stating that the actor's trademark comedic indifference seemed to be lacking commitment, and Caroll said that his well-received performance in ''Ghostbusters'' had been replaced by a \"smug swagger and constant smirking\" that she found irritating.<ref name=\"RevChicagoReader\"/><ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/> ''Variety'' said that his character is central to the film because of his ad-libbed dialog, and Groen argued that Murray essentially carried the film alone.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Hinson said that Murray's comedic performance was vital to tempering the film from becoming over-sentimental when discussing battling negativity with positivity.<ref name=\"RevWaPo\"/>\n\nThomas said that the previous film had allowed his character to be aloof, selfish, and immature, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' pushed him towards being in a mature relationship and demonstrating genuine human warmth, which he felt did not work.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Others were critical of the relationship between Murray and Weaver, with Benson commenting that the characters felt unconnected and more like rivals than lovers.{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} Thomas and Siskel said that the film's emphasis on this romantic subplot was to its detriment, both occupying too much of its runtime and largely removing Murray from the action scenes.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/> Clark lamented that Weaver was underutilized in a stereotypical working mother role.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=1D}}\n\nMacNicol's performance was consistently praised.<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/><ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}}{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} Groen, who was critical of much of the cast for lackluster performances, said that his \"wickedly funny\" performance was the film's sole surprising feature.{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Canby and Kehr concurred on MacNicol being a highlight of the film, with Thomas saying that his character would be impersonated by children everywhere.<ref name=\"RevCanby\"/><ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/><ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Carroll called it a  \"deliriously over-the-top performance\".<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/> Moranis was also mentioned as a highlight for his comedic performance.

An older, caucasian male with short dark hair with slight greying on the sides. He is looking towards the camera with a slight smile. |Director [[Ivan Reitman]] in 2011. He blamed the film's perceived failure on audiences' desire for darker films.]]\n\nFinancially, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was a relative success but it failed to meet studio expectations as a sequel to the highest-grossing comedy of all time. Despite being predicted to outperform its rival films before its release it failed to do so.<ref name=\"LAtimesApr1990\"/><ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\"/> As a part of the most successful summer for film to that date, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as a critical and commercial failure; it also failed to garner the same passionate response from critics and fans as its predecessor.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> While Columbia did not comment, industry experts believed the film was undone, at least partly, by the combination of ''Batman'' attracting teenage audiences and ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' taking family audiences.<ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\"/> Another issue was the quantity of films being released close together and unexpected successes that meant films were staying in theaters longer than anticipated. By only mid-July, one theater was alternating ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''The Karate Kid III'' on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon 2'' on other screens.<ref name=\"LATimesGlut\"/>\n\nReitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He said he felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of ''Batman'', which had a darker tone whereas ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/><ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Reitman also felt the novelty of ''Ghostbusters'' could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In 2014, he said, \"It didn't all come together{{nbsp}}... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> It has also been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high. This period also allowed a potential cultural saturation of the brand through the cartoon series and merchandise.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/>\n\nReitman was disappointed with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'s}} performance and said making the film had not been as much fun an experience as working on ''Ghostbusters''. He told Columbia he would not be part of a third film, and intended to break from comedies altogether.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In a 2008 interview, Murray said, \"We did a sequel and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was{{nbsp}}... the real thing{{nbsp}}... They'd written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]. And the special-effects guys got it{{nbsp}}... There were a few great scenes in it, but it wasn't the same movie.\"<ref name=\"SciFi2008\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> Moranis said, \"To have something as offbeat, unusual, and unpredictable [as] the first ''Ghostbusters'', it's next to impossible to create something better. [And] with sequels{{nbsp}}... they want better.\"<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Much as with the first film, Hudson was disappointed his role was relatively small. In ''Ghostbusters'', many of his major scenes had been given to Murray who was better-known, and Hudson felt the sequel continued to marginalize his character. He affirmed that despite this, he appreciated the role because of the positive way in which fans have reacted to it.<ref name=\"EWNov2014\"/><ref name=\"HudsonGuardian\"/>\n\n===Home media===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on [[VHS]] on November 22, 1989, only shortly after the end of its theatrical run. Since the early 1980s, home media was normally released at least six months after films launched in theaters, and in the case of blockbusters like ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''Batman'', anywhere from nine to twelve months later. To take advantage of the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]], ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', ''Batman'', and ''When Harry Met Sally...'' were all released before the end of the year. The ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' VHS was priced at $90 and aimed towards rentals rather than individual purchases.<ref name=\"LAtimesOct201989\"/><ref name=\"LATIMESAug91989\"/><ref name=\"LATimesOct61989\"/> The film entered the rental chart at number 10 and by late December it peaked as the second top VHS rental behind ''Batman''.<ref name=\"LATimesVideo1\"/><ref name=\"LATImesVideo2\"/> The release was controversial for the use of [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] \u2014 the process of transferring a film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio \u2014 which cropped much of the video shown on screen.<ref name=\"HomeLaserDisc\"/> A [[DVD]] version was released in 1999.<ref name=\"HomeDVD\"/>\n\n[[Blu-ray]] disc editions were released to celebrate the film's 25th and 30th anniversaries in 2014 and 2019 respectively; the film was remastered and the releases feature [[4K resolution]] video, deleted scenes, alternate takes, and an interview with Aykroyd and Reitman. The 30th-anniversary version was packaged in a limited-edition steel book cover, and also included ''Ghostbusters'' and commentary by Reitman, Aykroyd, and producer Joe Medjuck.<ref name=\"ColliderSep14\"/><ref name=\"SyFyApr19\"/>\n\nThe original soundtrack of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was first released on [[compact disc]] in 1989.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Brown's song \"On Our Own\" was a number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] music chart for one week in early August before being replaced by ''Batman''{{'}}s own hit song \"[[Batdance]]\" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=\"BillboardRANDB\"/> \"On Our Own\" peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, again behind ''Batdance'', and later behind \"[[Right Here Waiting]]\" by [[Richard Marx]]. \"On Our Own\" spent 20 weeks on the chart.<ref name=\"Billboardoverview\"/><ref name=\"BillBoardPrince\"/><ref name=\"BillboardMarx\"/> The Run-DMC version of \"Ghostbusters\" failed to develop the same level of enduring fandom as Parker, Jr.'s original.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In 2014, the Run-DMC version was released on a special-edition, white [[vinyl record]] that was presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' respectively.<ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\nSeveral elements of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'' in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/>\n\nSimilarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a demi-god, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}}{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made prior to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attack]] had taken on darker, unintended meanings, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as \"hokey\" or false, now seemed \"touchingly real\".{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}} Murray described it as a \"story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people.\"{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=99}} Unlike ''Ghostbusters'', ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters' personal successes.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Indeed, the Ghostbusters' involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}} \n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included ''Three Men and a Baby'' (1987),  ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989), ''Uncle Buck'' (1989), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years' highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=102}} These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}} ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child's biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}} This focus is evident during the film's finale where Vigo's portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAs with the previous film, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people. Government representatives are shown to be more concerned with proper processes than the imminent threat of the ghosts.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> They are shown to be incompetent or pursuing an agenda of self-interest that means they cannot be trusted to protect the people they represent.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} The Ghostbusters' outspokenness results in them being sent to a psychiatric institution to silence them.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> The Ghostbusters are freed from the governmental bonds\u2014the legal requirements barring them from operating as paranormal exterminators\u2014but only while they are solving more problems than they create.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=212}} Christine Alice Corcos describes the courtroom scene, in which the executed Scoleri brothers' return to wreak havoc, as a demonstration of the failure of the legal system. The government must again empower the Ghostbusters to deal with the problem, reaffirming the team's personal liberty over government influence.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} Corcos also analyzed the slime as a symbol of pollution. The human soul is polluted by negativity, which is given a physical form as slime beneath the city until there is too much for the Earth to handle.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|pp=266\u2013267}} Zoila Clark considered the ghosts to represent immigrants to America.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=31, 37}} Several antagonists and ghostly forces are foreign\u2014the Scoleri brothers, the passengers of the Titanic, Janosz, and Vigo.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=37\u201338}} Vigo is compared to [[Count Dracula]], a threatening foreign entity that hypnotizes subjects with his eyes, and aims to take an American woman for his own.{{sfn|Clark|2015|p=37}} The Statue of Liberty is of French origin and although it is described as a symbol of purity, Murray's character sexualizes it, defining it outside the American stereotype of purity.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' has been labeled as the film that \"killed\" the franchise because it made less money from a larger budget than ''Ghostbusters'' and because the filming experience and resulting reception dissuaded Murray from involvement in a third film.<ref name=\"IndieJun14\"/><ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> While some modern critics continue to criticize it as a bad film or inferior to its predecessor, it may only seem that way in comparison with ''Ghostbusters'' and is otherwise above average.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> In a 2014 interview, Reitman defended the film, saying while it was unfairly compared with ''Batman'' at the time, he felt ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' still holds up well against the superhero film.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/>\n\n[[Digital Spy]] defended the film as being as good as or better than ''Ghostbusters''. It said the plot of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a \"seamless\" third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences. <ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> [[Den of Geek]] compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like ''Back to the Future Part II'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> ''[[Deadspin]]'' said that like those aforementioned films, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> [[Uproxx]] called it the ideal film to watch during the [[New Year]] period because it offers an unsubtle, but simple morality tale about treating others well.<ref name=\"LegacyUproxx\"/>\n\nContemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 53% approval rating from 38 critics\u2014an average rating of 5.32/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Thanks to the cast, ''Ghostbusters 2'' is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor\".<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.<ref name=\"DOG2009Best\"/>\n\n===Merchandise===\n{{see also|List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters II video game|l1=Ghostbusters video games}}\nFilm merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the ''Star Wars'' series. Merchandising for ''Ghostbusters'' was unsuccessful; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off ''The Real Ghostbusters''. Sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they are based on established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film including water guns, colored slimes,<ref name=\"NYTimesJun89\"/> [[coloring book]]s, comics, and children's meals.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers.<ref name=\"LATimesToys\"/> Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional [[noisemaker]] toy called the \"Ghostblaster\", which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant [[Hardee's]], were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries.<ref name=\"UPIHardees\"/><ref name=\"CSPCHardees\"/> [[Now Comics]] released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in ''The Real Ghostbusters'' cartoon universe.

''New Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.<ref name=\"ViceVideoGames\"/><ref name=\"EngagetNes\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' merchandise has included [[Playmobil]] sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A.<ref name=\"MerchPlaymobil\"/> A [[board game]], ''Ghostbusters: The Board Game II'', was released in 2017 by [[Cryptozoic Entertainment]].

The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/><ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In the years that followed the release of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', Aykroyd continued his attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent'', which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton\u2014a demonic version of Manhattan\u2014where they would encounter the demon [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton, was released. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"DOGJun14\"/><ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/> The game establishes that following the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters' firehouse.<ref name=\"DOGJul16Game\"/> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, [[Byron Preiss|iBooks]], went out of business.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/> Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have also continued the original characters' adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/><ref name=\"THRJan2019\"/>\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer serve as director for a potential third film.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"THRFeb14\"/> He decided the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights. Reitman spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said, \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children\u2019s lives\". He and Aykroyd set up a production company called [[Ghost Corps]] to continue and expand the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', which was directed by [[Paul Feig]]<ref name=\"VultureControl\"/> and starred [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as the Ghostbusters.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"BBCJan15\"/> Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was later considered a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"MSNBCMar16\"/><ref name=\"PolygonJul16\"/><ref name=\"FortuneJul16\"/><ref name=\"EsquireJun17\"/> A second, direct sequel to the original two films, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', was announced in January 2019, with Reitman's son [[Jason Reitman|Jason]] serving as director.

It stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, [[Sigourney Weaver]], Ramis, [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ernie Hudson]], and [[Annie Potts]]. It is the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the second film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the demi-god [[Gozer]]. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters reform to combat it and save the world.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of ''Ghostbusters'', [[Columbia Pictures]] wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30\u201340 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed compared to the original film's 13-month cycle; large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on June 16, 1989, to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of [[Peter MacNicol]] and Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original's $282.2 million, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, the effect of which dissuaded Murray from participating in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film. Its soundtrack single, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]]\" by [[Bobby Brown]], was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.\n\nThe film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Ghostbusters''. Although some retrospective audiences praised it, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is generally seen as a poor follow-up to ''Ghostbusters'' and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], music, toys, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]]. Despite the relative failure of ''Ghostbusters II'', a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. A financially unsuccessful and controversial [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 series reboot]] led to renewed efforts on a direct sequel, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', which is scheduled for release in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after saving New York City from destruction by the demigod [[Gozer]], the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Raymond Stantz owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children's entertainers. Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions, and Peter Venkman hosts a television show about psychics.\n\nDana Barrett, Peter's ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum cleaning paintings. She turns to the Ghostbusters for help after Oscar's [[baby transport|baby stroller]] rolls, seemingly by itself, into a busy road intersection. At the museum, a portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, a brutal, sixteenth-century tyrant and powerful magician, comes to life and enslaves Dana's boss Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar's stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system. Raymond obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally kicks a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. In the courtroom, the slime sample is presented as evidence. It responds physically to judge Wexler's angry tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, summoning the ghosts of two brothers he sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the revocation of the order banning them from operating.\n\nOne night, the slime invades Dana's apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner, Egon, Raymond, and Winston explore the underground river of slime and are pulled in. They begin fighting until Egon realizes they are being influenced by the slime. They determine that the river of slime flows to the museum.\n\nThe Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their suspicions but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's political interests. A spirit in the form of Janosz kidnaps Oscar and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime. On [[New Year's Eve]], the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread chaos. Learning of Hardemeyer's actions, the mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released. \n\nDetermining the need for a positive symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively charged slime to animate the [[Statue of Liberty]] and pilot it through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the museum's slime covering partially recedes and they use the Statue's torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from completing his possession of Oscar.\n\nThe ghostbusters rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", and their positivity weakens Vigo. He is forced to return to the painting and the Ghostbusters are freed. Vigo possesses Raymond, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and destroy Vigo, his portrait being replaced by their likenesses surrounding Oscar. In the aftermath, the Ghostbusters are cheered by the city and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.\n\n==Cast ==\n{{main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1989 Cast.png|thumb|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis|Stars of the film include (l\u2013r, top row) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], (bottom row) [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Rick Moranis]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz|Raymond Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Janosz Poha\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Jack Hardemeyer\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mayor Lenny Clotch\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Judge Stephen Wexler\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as the Prosecutor\n* William T.

The man is shown from his front-right profile, facing right and smiling away from the camera. |Then-[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[David Puttnam]] was blamed for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s lengthy production, though director [[Ivan Reitman]] said it was more the fault of the reluctant cast and crew.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/>]]\n\nAfter the massive success of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', a sequel was considered inevitable even though the film had been developed as a stand-alone project.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/><ref name=\"NYTDec88\"/> The development of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was arduous, and the behind-the-scenes conflicts were given as much coverage in the press as the film.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> When [[David Puttnam]] became chairman of [[Columbia Pictures]] in June 1986, he was not interested in developing an expensive sequel to ''Ghostbusters'' despite its success. He favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987) and the comedy film ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1989) over big-budget blockbusters. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the \"world market\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' was part of former Columbia executive [[Frank Price]]'s legacy, and Puttnam would have had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nReitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam's fault and that executives above Puttnam at Columbia's New York branch had attempted to work around him because they thought he was holding up the project, but they discovered they could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"VultureControl\"/>\n\nIn April 1987, Puttnam announced that ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script.<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/><ref name=\"LooperDunno\"/> Puttnam was removed from his job in September 1987. It was reported that this was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray for making millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving \"back to his art.

Ramis later said, \"there was a little air to clear\" before they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> In March 1988,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz's colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy's, a celebrity restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had experienced a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> \n\nMonths of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, \"it's a big one\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> This was done to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> After this, the film was rushed into production, with filming scheduled for summer 1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/> Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had a shorter schedule than its predecessor's one-year turnaround.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} [[Michael C.

Early on, they decided ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=57}} Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana's relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|pp=57,58}} Instead, they chose to have Peter's and Dana's relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}}\n\nThe river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the build-up of negative human emotions in large cities;{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}}{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} he considered it a metaphor for [[urban decay]] and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} Ramis said; \"Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?\".<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}} He said; \"cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to{{nbsp}}... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} The story evolved far from Ramis' and Aykroyd's combined efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year,<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/> and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nIn the years since the release of the more adult-oriented ''Ghostbusters'', its animated spin-off television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' had become popular with its target child audience.

He described ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt \"radioactive\" after the failure of his personal project ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"CSTEbert\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for \"greed\" or \"business\" reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence.

When he wrote the scene, Ramis expected the production to use a manhole, but the only available underground location was a telephone conduit. Space in the hole was limited, and the actors had to squeeze into it while covered in slime. Freezing temperatures combined with the liquid slime made the actors uncomfortable.

When they learned the superhero film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' was also being released that day, they asked to move to the 16th. According to Gross, \"Joe Medjuck and I were turning pale{{nbsp}}... it did not look possible{{nbsp}}... It was a real killer\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}}\n\nSeveral new scenes were added to increase the sense of urgency and threat to the Ghostbusters, including the underground ghost train sequence and the associated severed-heads scare. A scene showing the Ghostbusters' developed photographs of Vigo bursting into flames, threatening to immolate them, was also added. Reitman wanted these scenes added because he thought his previous cut of the film focused too much on the relationship between Murray's and Weaver's characters.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/> The ghost train scene was filmed at the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] night club in New York. It was added to create a sense of an unseen force trying to keep the Ghostbusters away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} Medjuck noted that the added scenes did not require extensive special effects.{{sfn|McCabe|2016B|pp=74,75}} Cheech Marin's cameo as a dock supervisor was also added in this period.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nThe additional content replaced some scenes and subplots that were far into completion and contained finished special effects.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Additional shooting was done in [[Washington Square Park]], which was used for the monster moving under the [[Washington Square Arch]]. The popularity of the film was evident at that time when thousands of people arrived after hearing ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was being filmed there. They took part in filming, screaming on cue and running to escape the monster.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The film's final battle with Vigo was reshot, and the way that Vigo left the painting to confront the Ghostbusters changed completely.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nOne of the cut scenes included a subplot in which the Raymond Stantz character is possessed by Vigo following his inspection of the Vigo painting. Raymond erratically drives the [[Ectomobile]] until he is freed of Vigo's control by Winston. This explained Raymond's possession in the finale. Some of this footage was repurposed into a montage.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/>{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} There were also scenes of Louis Tully attempting to capture Slimer, which test audiences found intrusive, and Slimer was reduced to two appearances.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} Gross said they retained some Slimer scenes for children but that audiences generally had no reaction to the character, which was not what they had expected.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=22}} Because the sequence in which Tully's cousin frees the Ghostbusters from the psychiatric hospital was removed, a scene showing a paranormal eclipse from the Mayor's office was added to explain the Mayor securing their release. Other removed scenes showed Raymond and Egon experimenting with the slime, which explained how they learned to manipulate it to control the Statue of Liberty. A ghost was also removed from the sequence in which the slime causes ghosts to rise across New York because Reitman felt it was not creepy enough.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> \n\n===Music===\n\n[[Ray Parker, Jr.]] helped develop an updated version of his hit song \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\", which was co-written and performed by [[Hip hop|hip hop group]] [[Run-DMC]].<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/><ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> Aiming to replicate the success of the original, soundtrack producer Peter Afterman wanted to hire Bobby Brown who had a recent succession of hit songs.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBobbyB\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\"/> To secure Brown's involvement, Afterman offered Brown's music label, [[MCA Records]], the rights to the soundtrack. Brown agreed in exchange for receiving a role in the film. Filming had nearly concluded at that time, but Reitman wrote Brown a cameo as the mayor's doorman.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\"/> The resulting song, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]],\" was written by [[L.A.

ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots,{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited [[Tippett Studio]].<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Slime===\nMethocel, a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]] mocked up differently colored batches and Reitman settled on pink.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The film required approximately {{convert|100,000|USgal|l|sp=us|abbr=off}} of slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} [[Mica]] dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}}\n\nThe river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough {{convert|1|foot|meter|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} long. It operated in a [[Pump#Gravity pumps|gravity pump]] and was fed from a large tank {{convert|15|feet|meters|abbr=on}} above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered [[Slosh dynamics|baffles]] were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=9, 10}} Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in's boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson's character being dragged away by the slime's current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river's natural movements.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Creature effects===\nThe returning Slimer ghost was re-developed to be more child-friendly like his popular ''The Real Ghostbusters'' incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in ''Ghostbusters'', was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=21}} \n\nThe Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis' father's store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film's scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters' evil rather than their pre-death appearances.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}} Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe ghosts' faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} The brothers' electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through [[mylar]] material that could be warped to affect the underlying image.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=18}} For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar's team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=13,14}} Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}} ''Ghostbusters'' storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he \"could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}}\n\n[[File:116 NYC (Liberty Island).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Statue of Liberty as seen from below.

[[Dan Aykroyd]] liked the idea of animating something otherwise immobile.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}]]\n\nThe animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] moving or [[Victoria Falls]] flowing in reverse.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The statue's role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=34}} The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue's crown\u2014 which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a [[gimbal]], allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=41}} Fye also portrayed the ghost of a [[Central Park]] jogger.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=20}}\n\nTo portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights off Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol's head while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol's gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The \"ghost nanny\" version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman's apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon\u2014an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal\u2014billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and [[Santa Claus]].{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} MacNicol wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost's extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=26,27}} \n\nWelch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman's apartment to scale; it was positioned {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}\n\nThe [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the ''Titanic'' with slightly modified aspects; the position of the ship's name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car but there was no time to find a suitable model and an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in [[stop motion]] by [[Phil Tippett]], who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}}\n\n===Vigo the Carpathian===\n[[File:Ghostbusters II Vigo Painting.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An image of Wilhelm von Homburg in character as Vigo the Carpathian.

Eytchison specialized in ''[[Tableau vivant]]s''\u2014the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said while they could have figured out the concept, they did not have enough time and needed an expert. The aim was to portray what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting's look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to \"[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan [the Barbarian]]]\".<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period's painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nEytchison's team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Eytchison's team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg's  costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nOnce the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch's department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=7\u20139}} Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg's disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Another concept had him \"peel\" from the canvas,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}} A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by [[Harold Weed]] as the possessed version of Aykroyd's character.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{see also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\n''Ghostbusters''{{'}} hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters' equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in an uncredited role.

Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower\u2014a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle. He re-purposed leftover prop warning labels and symbols from his work on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) to make the equipment look more authentic.<ref name=\"BTMSep14Dane\"/>\n\nThe slime blower weapons were three times heavier than the proton packs; the tanks did not contain slime, which was pumped through the guns from off-camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}} The bulky proton packs, which were considered heavy and uncomfortable during the filming of ''Ghostbusters'', were redesigned to weigh {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in comparison with the {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}} versions used on the previous film. The new design offered more comfort while removing some of the powered effects.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Muren's team redesigned the proton pack neutrino wand beams to be multi-functional, allowing them to be used as lassos or fishing lines to capture ghosts instead of being straight beams.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Five remotely controlled baby strollers were used to create the possessed stroller in the film's opening; motors and driveshafts were concealed with the stroller's chrome body, and brakes that could stop it immediately or slow it gradually were used.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Gaspar employed two-time national miniature-car champion Jay Halsey to drive the stroller; he had to weave it between traffic from up to {{convert|75|feet|meters|abbr=on}} away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}}\n\n==Release==\nIn the late 1980s, film sequels were still quite rare, but the concept of the media franchise had quickly developed following the success of the original ''[[Star Wars Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' trilogy.<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/> In 1989, more sequels were released than in any previous year, including ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'', ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', and ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimesMay89\"/> Also released that year were original hits that would become popular classics like ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', and ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.<ref name=\"NYPostJul14\"/> That year's most anticipated film was ''Batman'', which was scheduled for release a week after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', and whose logo had become ubiquitous through a significant marketing campaign aided by its mega-congomlerate owner [[Time-Warner]].<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/><ref name=\"THRJun19\"/><ref name=\"MentalFlossMar19\"/> Shortly before its release, a \"major theater chain\" executive said they expected ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' to make approximately $150 million during its run, behind ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($225 million) and ''Batman'' ($175 million), and ahead of ''Lethal Weapon 2'' ($100 million).<ref name=\"LATimesJun81989\"/>\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was originally scheduled for release in July 1989 but less than three months before release, it was brought forward to June to avoid direct competition with ''Batman''.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The premiere of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' took place on June 15, 1989, at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], with an after-party that required payment to attend at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]; the entrance fees collected were donated to [[Saint John's Health Center]].<ref name=\"LATimesJun191989\"/> \n\n===Box office===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' received a wide release on June 16, 1989, in 2,410 theaters, compared with the original film's opening on 1,339.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"LATimesJun89\"/> Compared to ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} $13{{nbsp}}million opening weekend, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' film earned $29.5{{nbsp}}million\u2014an average of $12,229 per theater\u2014as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the action-adventure film ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($11.7{{nbsp}}million) which was in its fourth week of release and drama film ''Dead Poets Society'' ($9.1{{nbsp}}million), which was in its third.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"BOMOpeningWKND\"/> Based on its gross and an average increase in ticket price of 22% since ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} release, an estimated 2{{nbsp}}million more people went to see the film's opening.

They said that ''Ghostbusters'' had succeeded by projecting childlike fantasies onto adult characters who snubbed authority and bonded in a clubhouse, but by taking a surreal comedic fantasy and adding humanity to the central characters, the sequel had become \"Four Ghostbusters and a Baby\", a reference to the 1987 comedy film ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=1D}}<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] called it a disappointment, saying he reviewed ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in a public screening and heard no laughter during the entire film.<ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/> \n\nSeveral reviewers criticized the film for too closely emulating the structure and story elements of its predecessor.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/>{{sfn|Schickel|1989|p=89}} [[Gene Siskel]] called it a poor copy that offered nothing new, as though they \"were filming the first draft of a script\".<ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/> [[Richard Schickel]] was critical of the glut of sequels in 1989 in his review.

By only mid-July, one theater was alternating ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''The Karate Kid III'' on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon 2'' on other screens.<ref name=\"LATimesGlut\"/>\n\nReitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He said he felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of ''Batman'', which had a darker tone whereas ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/><ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Reitman also felt the novelty of ''Ghostbusters'' could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In 2014, he said, \"It didn't all come together{{nbsp}}... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> It has also been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high.

He told Columbia he would not be part of a third film, and intended to break from comedies altogether.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In a 2008 interview, Murray said, \"We did a sequel and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was{{nbsp}}... the real thing{{nbsp}}...

The 30th-anniversary version was packaged in a limited-edition steel book cover, and also included ''Ghostbusters'' and commentary by Reitman, Aykroyd, and producer Joe Medjuck.<ref name=\"ColliderSep14\"/><ref name=\"SyFyApr19\"/>\n\nThe original soundtrack of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was first released on [[compact disc]] in 1989.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Brown's song \"On Our Own\" was a number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] music chart for one week in early August before being replaced by ''Batman''{{'}}s own hit song \"[[Batdance]]\" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=\"BillboardRANDB\"/> \"On Our Own\" peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, again behind ''Batdance'', and later behind \"[[Right Here Waiting]]\" by [[Richard Marx]]. \"On Our Own\" spent 20 weeks on the chart.<ref name=\"Billboardoverview\"/><ref name=\"BillBoardPrince\"/><ref name=\"BillboardMarx\"/> The Run-DMC version of \"Ghostbusters\" failed to develop the same level of enduring fandom as Parker, Jr.'s original.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In 2014, the Run-DMC version was released on a special-edition, white [[vinyl record]] that was presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' respectively.<ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\nSeveral elements of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'' in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/>\n\nSimilarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a demi-god, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}}{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made prior to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attack]] had taken on darker, unintended meanings, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as \"hokey\" or false, now seemed \"touchingly real\".{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}} Murray described it as a \"story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people.\"{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=99}} Unlike ''Ghostbusters'', ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters' personal successes.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Indeed, the Ghostbusters' involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}} \n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987),  ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989), ''[[Uncle Buck]]'' (1989), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years' highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=102}} These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}} ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child's biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}} This focus is evident during the film's finale where Vigo's portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAs with the previous film, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people. Government representatives are shown to be more concerned with proper processes than the imminent threat of the ghosts.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> They are shown to be incompetent or pursuing an agenda of self-interest that means they cannot be trusted to protect the people they represent.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} The Ghostbusters' outspokenness results in them being sent to a psychiatric institution to silence them.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> The Ghostbusters are freed from the governmental bonds\u2014the legal requirements barring them from operating as paranormal exterminators\u2014but only while they are solving more problems than they create.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=212}} Christine Alice Corcos describes the courtroom scene, in which the executed Scoleri brothers' return to wreak havoc, as a demonstration of the failure of the legal system. The government must again empower the Ghostbusters to deal with the problem, reaffirming the team's personal liberty over government influence.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} Corcos also analyzed the slime as a symbol of pollution. The human soul is polluted by negativity, which is given a physical form as slime beneath the city until there is too much for the Earth to handle.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|pp=266\u2013267}} Zoila Clark considered the ghosts to represent immigrants to America.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=31, 37}} Several antagonists and ghostly forces are foreign\u2014the Scoleri brothers, the passengers of the Titanic, Janosz, and Vigo.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=37\u201338}} Vigo is compared to [[Count Dracula]], a threatening foreign entity that hypnotizes subjects with his eyes, and aims to take an American woman for his own.{{sfn|Clark|2015|p=37}} The Statue of Liberty is of French origin and although it is described as a symbol of purity, Murray's character sexualizes it, defining it outside the American stereotype of purity.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' has been labeled as the film that \"killed\" the franchise because it made less money from a larger budget than ''Ghostbusters'' and because the filming experience and resulting reception dissuaded Murray from involvement in a third film.<ref name=\"IndieJun14\"/><ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> While some modern critics continue to criticize it as a bad film or inferior to its predecessor, it may only seem that way in comparison with ''Ghostbusters'' and is otherwise above average.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> In a 2014 interview, Reitman defended the film, saying while it was unfairly compared with ''Batman'' at the time, he felt ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' still holds up well against the superhero film.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/>\n\n[[Digital Spy]] defended the film as being as good as or better than ''Ghostbusters''. It said the plot of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a \"seamless\" third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences. <ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> [[Den of Geek]] compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like ''Back to the Future Part II'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> ''[[Deadspin]]'' said that like those aforementioned films, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> [[Uproxx]] called it the ideal film to watch during the [[New Year]] period because it offers an unsubtle, but simple morality tale about treating others well.<ref name=\"LegacyUproxx\"/>\n\nContemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 53% approval rating from 38 critics\u2014an average rating of 5.32/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Thanks to the cast, ''Ghostbusters 2'' is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor\".<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.<ref name=\"DOG2009Best\"/>\n\n===Merchandise===\n{{see also|List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters II video game|l1=Ghostbusters video games}}\nFilm merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the ''Star Wars'' series. Merchandising for ''Ghostbusters'' was unsuccessful; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off ''The Real Ghostbusters''. Sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they are based on established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film including water guns, colored slimes,<ref name=\"NYTimesJun89\"/> [[coloring book]]s, comics, and children's meals.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers.<ref name=\"LATimesToys\"/> Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional [[noisemaker]] toy called the \"Ghostblaster\", which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant [[Hardee's]], were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries.<ref name=\"UPIHardees\"/><ref name=\"CSPCHardees\"/> [[Now Comics]] released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in ''The Real Ghostbusters'' cartoon universe. The story included subplots from the film including Ray's possession while driving the Ectomobile and Tully trying to capture Slimer.{{sfn|ComicBookIssue1|1989|pp=1,2}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue2|1989|pp=1,2,21\u201324, 27}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue3|1989|pp=1,2}}\n\nSeveral video games were released around the release of the film; ''[[Ghostbusters II (computer video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' in 1989 for personal computers, ''[[Ghostbusters II (NES video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' (published by [[Activision]]) in 1990 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), and ''[[New Ghostbusters II]]'' (as ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''), also in 1990 for the Nintendo [[Game Boy]]. ''New Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.<ref name=\"ViceVideoGames\"/><ref name=\"EngagetNes\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' merchandise has included [[Playmobil]] sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A.<ref name=\"MerchPlaymobil\"/> A [[board game]], ''Ghostbusters: The Board Game II'', was released in 2017 by [[Cryptozoic Entertainment]]. Based on the film, it casts the players as the Ghostbusters and tasks them with defeating Vigo and his ghostly minions. The game's creation was [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]], raising over $760,000.<ref name=\"BoardGame1\"/><ref name=\"BoardGame2\"/><ref name=\"BoardGame3\"/> The 2019 [[Halloween Horror Nights]] event at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Studios Florida]] held a 'Ghostbusters-themed haunted maze that featured locations, characters, and ghosts from ''Ghostbusters'', and the Scoleri Brothers.<ref name=\"MazeIGN\"/>\n\n==Sequels and spin-offs==\n{{see also|Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}\n[[File:Men Women and Children 45 (15273754892).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A profile image of Jason Reitman.

He is seen from his right, smiling towards something off camera. |[[Jason Reitman]], director of  ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', a sequel to ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'']]\n\nDiscussion about a sequel took place during filming of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', but Ramis was dismissive because of both the actors' ages and the difficulty in getting all of the cast together.<ref name=\"NYTDec88\"/> Despite ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'s}} relative failure, the name recognition and popularity of the actors and their characters meant a third film was still pursued. The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/><ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In the years that followed the release of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', Aykroyd continued his attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent'', which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton\u2014a demonic version of Manhattan\u2014where they would encounter the demon [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton, was released. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"DOGJun14\"/><ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/> The game establishes that following the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters' firehouse.<ref name=\"DOGJul16Game\"/> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, [[Byron Preiss|iBooks]], went out of business.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/> Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have also continued the original characters' adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/><ref name=\"THRJan2019\"/>\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer serve as director for a potential third film.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"THRFeb14\"/> He decided the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights. Reitman spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said, \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children\u2019s lives\". He and Aykroyd set up a production company called [[Ghost Corps]] to continue and expand the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', which was directed by [[Paul Feig]]<ref name=\"VultureControl\"/> and starred [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as the Ghostbusters.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"BBCJan15\"/> Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was later considered a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"MSNBCMar16\"/><ref name=\"PolygonJul16\"/><ref name=\"FortuneJul16\"/><ref name=\"EsquireJun17\"/> A second, direct sequel to the original two films, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', was announced in January 2019, with Reitman's son [[Jason Reitman|Jason]] serving as director. This sequel was written by him and [[Gil Kenan]], and is scheduled for a March 2021 release.<ref name=\"EWJan19\"/> Several members of the original cast are set to appear in the film alongside new cast members [[Mckenna Grace]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Carrie Coon]], and [[Paul Rudd]].<ref name=\"GB2020Continued\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist||refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AICNOverview\">{{cite

{"title_page": "Noilly Prat", "text_new": "{{short description|Brand of French vermouth, now owned by Martini & Rossi}}\n[[Image:Vermouth.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A pre-2009 bottle of Noilly Prat]]\n'''Noilly Prat''' ({{IPA-fr|nwa.ji p\u0281at}}) is a [[brand]] of [[vermouth]] from France, owned by the Italian company [[Martini & Rossi]]. \"White\" Noilly Prat is the archetype of dry, straw-coloured French vermouth. Noilly Prat now makes Red and Ambre vermouths as well, introduced in the 1960s and 1980s, but they are less widely known. Noilly Prat Dry is 18% alcohol by volume. The Noilly Prat company is based in [[Marseillan, H\u00e9rault|Marseillan]], in the [[H\u00e9rault]] ''d\u00e9partement'' of southern [[France]], and is a subsidiary of [[Bacardi-Martini]]. Joseph Noilly, a herbalist, developed the first formula in 1813.\n\n==History==\nIt has long been known that leaving [[wine]] in a barrel alters its characteristics. Wine that was transported long distances in barrels and exposed to the weather became darker in colour and fuller-flavoured. It was to mimic this natural process that Joseph Noilly, in 1813, designed a process that made France's first vermouth. In 1855, his son Louis Noilly and son-in-law Claudius Prat set up the company that became Noilly Prat, moving the business to Marseillan where it remains to this day. The brand was acquired by its Italian competitor [[Martini & Rossi]] in 1971, which was merged into the [[Bacardi-Martini]] family of brands in 1992.\n\n==Manufacturing process==\n[[File:Noilly Prat Wine Barrels.JPG|thumb|right|Barrels for maturing the wine]]\nThe process used today is virtually unchanged since the 1850s. Noilly Prat is made exclusively from white grape varieties grown in the Marseillan area, principally ''[[Piquepoul|Picpoul de Pinet]]'' and ''[[Clairette blanche|Clairette]]''. These produce light, fruity wines which are matured in massive Canadian oak casks inside the original storerooms. The wine stays in these casks for 8 months, maturing and absorbing the flavour of the wood, before being transferred to smaller oak barrels which are taken outside and left for a year. Here they are exposed to the sun, wind, and low winter temperatures, while the wine is slowly changing. The result is a wine that is dry, full-bodied and amber coloured, similar to [[Madeira wine|Madeira]] or [[Sherry]]. During the year outside, 6 to 8% of the volume is lost to evaporation, the \"[[Angel's share|angels' share]]\".\n\nBrought back inside and left to rest for a few months, the wines are then blended together into oak casks. A small quantity of ''[[Mistelle]]'' (grape juice and alcohol) is added to the wines in order to soften them, along with a dash of fruit essence to accentuate their flavour.\n\nIn the oak casks, a process of ''[[maceration (wine)|maceration]]'', supposedly unique to Noilly Prat, takes place over a period of three weeks. A blend of some twenty herbs and spices is added by hand every day. The exact mix of herbs and spices that goes into Noilly Prat is a closely guarded secret, but includes [[camomile]], bitter [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] peel, [[nutmeg]], [[centaury]] (Yellow Gentian), [[coriander]], and [[cloves]]. After a further six weeks, the finished product is ready for bottling and is shipped in tankers to [[Beaucaire, Gard]], where it is bottled by [[Martini & Rossi]].\n\n==Variants==\nThe vast bulk of Noilly Prat wine is the Original French Dry vermouth. It is enjoyed as a chilled aperitif and in Martini Cocktails. However, three special variants have been made:\n\n*Red Noilly Prat is made in the same way, but with the addition of 30 flavourings, which produce the rich red colour. It is not sold in France, except from the Noilly Prat shop in Marseillan, being produced for export, principally to the USA.\n*Ambre Noilly Prat is available for purchase from the Noilly Prat shop in Marseillan and specialised stores.\n*(Colourless) Extra Dry Noilly Prat is a less complex wine formulated for the American extra-dry martini cocktail. Extra Dry is only shipped to North America, where it was available from 1979 until 2009. It returned late in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Blake|title=Noilly Prat brings back US-only dry vermouth formula|url=http://blog.wblakegray.com/2012/06/noilly-prat-brings-back-us-only-formula.html}}</ref> It has supplanted the French Dry, which is now unavailable in much of the United States.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Cocktails==\nNoilly Prat is often used in cocktails, the most common and well-known of which is probably the [[Martini (cocktail)|Martini]], consisting of one part Noilly Prat to one or more parts [[gin]] or [[vodka]], with a dash of [[orange bitters]], twist of lemon, or olive garnish. Over the years, the American preference for \"extra dry\" martinis led to the switch from gin to vodka, and to drastically reducing the flavour and quantity of the vermouth employed. However, in 2009, the extra-dry Noilly recipe exported to the USA was replaced by the original dry formula used worldwide. The change in recipe was accompanied by a change in the bottle's design.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123154573030469717\n | title = Don't Shoot the Messenger: Bad News for Martini Drinkers\n | first = Eric | last = Felten\n | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = 10 January 2009\n}}</ref> Some recipes substituted a vermouth from Dolin instead of Noilly Prat for making martinis,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://coudal.com/perfect.php\n | title = Perfect\n | first = Jim | last = Coudal\n}}</ref> which is said to be \"every bit as good as, although not by any means identical to, the old Noilly\".<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://coudal.com/archives/2010/12/perfect_remixed.php\n | title = Perfect Remixed\n | first = Jim | last = Coudal\n | date = 22 December 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Algonquin cocktail, named after the [[Algonquin Hotel]], is composed of [[rye whiskey]], Noilly Prat and [[pineapple]] juice.<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Rose\n | first =Anthony\n | title =101 cocktails that shook the world #17: The Algonquin\n | work=The Independent\n |location = London\n | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050514/ai_n14627112\n | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080505234032/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050514/ai_n14627112\n | url-status =dead\n | archivedate =5 May 2008\n | accessdate =16 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Cooking with Noilly Prat==\nNoilly Prat is widely used in cooking, and extensively used for sauces, especially to accompany fish.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open.<ref name=\"Cavill\" />\n\nA few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below.\n\n=== No toilet ===\n\n* Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live.<ref name=\"JMP2019\" /><ref name=\"Routray 880\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Routray P, Schmidt WP, Boisson S, Clasen T, Jenkins MW | title = Socio-cultural and behavioural factors constraining latrine adoption in rural coastal Odisha: an exploratory qualitative study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 15 | pages = 880 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26357958 | pmc = 4566293 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-015-2206-3 }}</ref>\n* Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms lead the people to defecate in the open.<ref name=\"Routray 880\" />\n* Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens.

If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting.

The path passes through [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] in northern [[Greece]], and [[Turkey]].\n\n==History==\nSultans Trail{{sic}} (''recte'' Sultan's) takes its name from sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|S\u00fcleyman Kanuni]], Suleiman the Magnificent, of the Ottoman Empire who led Ottoman armies to conquer [[Belgrade]] and most of Hungary before his invasion was checked at the [[Siege of Vienna]]. The main path follows the route of sultan Suleiman the Magnificent on his way to Vienna. He started on 10 May 1529 from Istanbul and arrived 23 September 1529 in Vienna (141 days). It was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious expedition to the west, but the Austrian garrison inflicted upon Suleiman his first defeat. A second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532. In 1566, at the age of 60, the sultan led his army for the last time; he died close to Szigetv\u00e1r in [[Hungary]].\n\nIn contrast to its past the Sultan's Trail nowadays forms a path of peace, a meeting place for people of all faiths and cultures. The trail starts at St. Stephen's Cathedral in the centre of Vienna; the bells of this church are made from the melted iron of Ottoman cannons. It ends at the tomb of the Sultan in Istanbul. The Sultan\u2019s Trail was developed by volunteers from the Netherlands-based NGO Sultans Trail - A European Cultural Route.\n\nApart from the Romanian and Bulgarian mountains, the trail can be walked all year round. Most parts of the route have ample accommodation such as hotels, pensions or private rooms. In parts of Hungary and Bulgaria a tent is necessary.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2020, [[BBC]] broadcast series three of ''Pilgrimage: The Road to Istanbul'' which was about the Sultans Trail.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC - Seven celebrities embark on a pilgrimage to Istanbul for BBC Two - Media Centre |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/pilgrimage

It is {{convert|2200|km}} long. The path passes through [[Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] in northern [[Greece]], and [[Turkey]].\n==History==\nSultans Trail{{sic}} (''recte'' Sultan's) takes its name from sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|S\u00fcleyman Kanuni]], Suleiman the Magnificent, of the Ottoman Empire who led Ottoman armies to conquer [[Belgrade]] and most of Hungary before his invasion was checked at the [[Siege of Vienna]]. The main path follows the route of sultan Suleiman the Magnificent on his way to Vienna. He started on 10 May 1529 from Istanbul and arrived 23 September 1529 in Vienna (141 days). It was to be the Ottoman Empire's most ambitious expedition to the west, but the Austrian garrison inflicted upon Suleiman his first defeat. A second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532. In 1566, at the age of 60, the sultan led his army for the last time; he died close to Szigetv\u00e1r in [[Hungary]].\n\nIn contrast to its past the Sultan's Trail nowadays forms a path of peace, a meeting place for people of all faiths and cultures. The trail starts at St. Stephen's Cathedral in the centre of Vienna; the bells of this church are made from the melted iron of Ottoman cannons. It ends at the tomb of the Sultan in Istanbul. The Sultan\u2019s Trail was developed by volunteers from the Netherlands-based NGO Sultans Trail - A European Cultural Route.\n\nApart from the Romanian and Bulgarian mountains, the trail can be walked all year round. Most parts of the route have ample accommodation such as hotels, pensions or private rooms. In parts of Hungary and Bulgaria a tent is necessary.\n==In popular culture==\nIn 2020, [[BBC]] broadcast series three of ''Pilgrimage: The Road to Istanbul'' which was about the Sultans Trail.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC - Seven celebrities embark on a pilgrimage to Istanbul for BBC Two - Media Centre |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/pilgrimage
