Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

ultimate power of the state that makes the constitution and basic laws, and supervise and elects all following organs;\n# [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC): the permanent legislative organ which makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervise all following organs;\n# [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], act as a ceremonial [[head of state]] in compliance with decisions made by the NPCSC, but exercises an independent power to nominate the Premier of the State Council; and the [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice-President]], who has no power itself, but assist the President.\n# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with \"Central People's Government\"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];\n# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC): the military branch, whose [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces including the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]];\n# [[National Supervisory Commission]] (NSC): the supervisory branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Court]] (SPC): the judicial branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (SPP): the prosecutorial branch.\n\nThe legal power of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] is guaranteed by [[Constitution of China|the PRC Constitution]] and its position as the supreme political authority in the PRC is realised through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.<ref>Ralph H. Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

The [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] special administrative regions (SARS) have some local autonomy since they have separate governments, legal systems, and basic constitutional laws, but they come under Beijing's control in matters of [[foreign policy]] and [[national security]], and their chief executives are handpicked by the central government. Below the provincial level in 2004 there were 50 rural prefectures, 283 prefecture-level cities, 374 county-level cities, 852 county-level districts under the jurisdiction of nearby cities, and 1,636 counties. There also were 662 cities (including those incorporated into the four centrally controlled municipalities), 808 urban districts, and 43,258 township-level regions. \n\nCounties are divided into townships and villages. While most have appointed officials running them, some lower-level jurisdictions have direct popular elections. The organs of self-governing ethnic autonomous areas (regions, prefectures, and counties)\u2014people's congresses and people's governments\u2014exercise the same powers as their provincial-level counterparts but are guided additionally by the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and require NPC Standing Committee approval for regulations they enact \"in the exercise of autonomy\" and \"in light of the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of the ethnic group or ethnic groups in the areas.\"{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nWhile operating under strict control and supervision by the central government, China's local governments manage relatively high share of fiscal revenues and expenditures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kadochnikov|first=Denis V.|date=2019-12-29|title=Fiscal decentralization and regional budgets' changing roles: a comparative case study of Russia and China|journal=Area Development and Policy|language=en|volume=|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1080/23792949.2019.1705171|issn=2379-2949}}</ref>\n\n== Civil service ==\n{{Main|Civil service of the People's Republic of China}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201354)]]\n* [[Government of the Republic of China|Five Yuans of the Republic of China]]\n* [[History of political parties in China]]\n* [[Political systems of Imperial China]]\n* [[Politics of China|Politics of the People's Republic of China]]\n** [[Elections in China]]\n** [[Orders of precedence in China]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Country study |country = China |abbr = cn |section = Government and Politics }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://english.gov.cn/ Official website of the Chinese Central Government] {{in lang|en}}  \n* [http://www.e-gov.org.cn/ China e-Government Network]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081224110923/http://www.chinainnovations.org/ China Government Innovation Network]\n* [http://www.ccgp.gov.cn/ China Government Procurement Information Network]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090504140432/http://govinfo.nlc.gov.cn/ Chinese Government Public Information Online Service Platform]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090830033427/http://www.prcgovernment.org/ Guide to Chinese Government Agencies]\n* [http://english.people.com.cn/data/organs/home.html Links to information regarding branches and departments of the PRC]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518042419/http://www.uschina.org/public/china/govstructure/ US-China Business Council's PRC Central Government Structure Report]\n\n{{-}}\n\n{{PRC State Organs}}\n{{Separation of powers}}\n{{People's Republic of China politics}}\n{{China topics |state = autocollapse }}\n{{Asia topic |Government of |title = Governments of Asia }}\n{{Portal bar|Politics|China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government Of The People's Republic Of China}}\n\n[[Category:Government of China| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China"}

{"title_page": "History of fair trade", "text_new": "The [[fair trade]] movement has undergone several important changes since its early days following [[World War II]]. Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.\n\n==The origins of fair trade==\n\nFair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.\n\nThe notion of the \u2018old moral economy\u2019 is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where \"notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market\".<ref name=\"Fridell, Gavin 2003\">Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.</ref> Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.<ref name=\"Fridell, Gavin 2003\"/>\n\nIn 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the \"Free Produce Society\", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.<ref>Newman, Richard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxN8GXEKspQC&pg=PA266 ''Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers''], NYU Press, 2008, p. 266. {{ISBN|0-8147-5826-6}}</ref> In 1830, African Americans formed the \"Colored Free Produce Society\", and women formed their own branch in 1831. In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of \"free produce\" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.<ref>Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor.

The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P.

Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).\n\nThe [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].<ref>International Fair Trade Association.

Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P.

The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.\n\nIn 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in \"underdeveloped regions\". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world's markets and consumers.\n\n==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==\nIn the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look \"tired and old fashioned\" in the marketplace.<ref name=\"Redfern A. 2002 p6\">Redfern A. & Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p6</ref> The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.\n\nIn the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}</ref> in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Caf\u00e9direct is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Caf\u00e9direct created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line \"We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop\".\n\nThe first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.<ref>International Fair Trade Association.

URL accessed on August 2, 2006.</ref>\n\nWhile a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm in 1992, in 2002 handcrafts accounted for 25.4% of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4%.<ref>Nicholls, A. & Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.</ref> The transition to agricultural commodities was further highlighted in 2002, when Oxfam decided to abandon its loss-making handcrafts trading program after 27 years of existence.

In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations \u2013 or \"LIs\" (for \"Labelling Initiatives\") \u2013 started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.\n\nIn 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.\n\nThe Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way \u2013 today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] & [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.\n\nIn January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.\n\nAt present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.\n\n== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==\nIn an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.\n\nThe FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.\n\n==Fair trade today==\nGlobal fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately \u20ac2.3 billion (US$3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.<ref>Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&cHash=d6f2e27d2c&tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.\n\n==The origins of fair trade==\n\nFair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.\n\nThe notion of the \u2018old moral economy\u2019 is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where \"notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market\".<ref name=\"Fridell, Gavin 2003\">Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.</ref> Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.<ref name=\"Fridell, Gavin 2003\"/>\n\nIn 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the \"Free Produce Society\", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.<ref>Newman, Richard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxN8GXEKspQC&pg=PA266 ''Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers''], NYU Press, 2008, p. 266. {{ISBN|0-8147-5826-6}}</ref> In 1830, African Americans formed the \"Colored Free Produce Society\", and women formed their own branch in 1831. In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of \"free produce\" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.<ref>Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor.

The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P.

Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).\n\nThe [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].<ref>International Fair Trade Association.

Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.<ref>Redfern A. & Snedker P.

The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.\n\nIn 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in \"underdeveloped regions\". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world's markets and consumers.\n\n==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==\nIn the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look \"tired and old fashioned\" in the marketplace.<ref name=\"Redfern A. 2002 p6\">Redfern A. & Snedker P.

International Labor Office. p6</ref> The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.\n\nIn the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}</ref> in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Caf\u00e9direct is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Caf\u00e9direct created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line \"We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop\".\n\nThe first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.<ref>International Fair Trade Association.

In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations \u2013 or \"LIs\" (for \"Labelling Initiatives\") \u2013 started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.\n\nIn 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.\n\nThe Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way \u2013 today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] & [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.\n\nIn January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.\n\nAt present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.\n\n== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==\nIn an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.\n\nThe FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.\n\n==Fair trade today==\nGlobal fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately \u20ac2.3 billion (US$3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.<ref>Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&cHash=d6f2e27d2c&tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

While at college Baird undertook a series of engineering apprentice jobs as part of his course. The conditions in industrial Glasgow at the time helped form his socialist convictions but also contributed to his ill health. He became an agnostic, though this did not strain his relationship with his father.<ref>R. W. Burns (2000). John Logie Baird, Television Pioneer. IET. p. 10. {{ISBN|9780852967973}}. \"Even Baird's conversion to agnosticism while living at home does not appear to have stimulated a rebuke from the Reverend John Baird. Moreover, Baird was freely allowed to try to persuade others\u2014including visiting clergy\u2014to his beliefs.\"</ref> His degree course was interrupted by the [[First World War]] and he never returned to [[college graduate|graduate]].\n\nAt the beginning of 1915 he volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty. Unable to go to the Front, he took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company, which was engaged in munitions work.<ref>T. McArthur and P. Waddell, ''Vision Warrior'', Orkney Press, 1990</ref>\n\n==Television experiments==\nThe development of television was the result of work by many inventors. Among them, Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field. Many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live, moving, [[greyscale]] television image from [[reflected light]]. Baird achieved this, where other inventors had failed, by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the [[signal conditioning]] from the photocell and the video amplifier.\n\n[[File:John Logie Baird, Apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|John Logie Baird with his television apparatus, circa 1925]]\nBetween 1902 and 1907, the German physicist [[Arthur Korn]] invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells. Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still [[fax]] pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification.<ref>T. Thorne Baker, ''Wireless Pictures and Television''. London: Constable & Company, 1926., pp. 28, 29, 81.</ref> Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.<ref>Terry and Elizabeth Korn. ''Trailblazer to Television: The Story of Arthur Korn''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1950.

He later rented a workshop in the Queen's Arcade in the town.

In addition, from 1933 Baird and the Baird Company were producing and broadcasting television programmes independently to the BBC, from Baird's studios and transmitter at the Crystal Palace in south London.<ref>Ray Herbert, ''The Crystal Palace Television Studios: John Logie Baird and British Television'', accessed online 6 January 2019 [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Link]</ref>\n\nOn 2 November 1936, from [[Alexandra Palace]] located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system, which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed and scanned. The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, due in part to a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail due in large part to the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.<ref>Kamm and Baird, ''John Logie Baird: A Life'', p. 286</ref>\n\nBaird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-[[Marconi Company|Marconi]] under [[Isaac Shoenberg]], which had access to patents developed by [[Vladimir Zworykin]] and [[RCA]]. Similarly, [[Philo T. Farnsworth]]'s electronic \"Image Dissector\" camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, the Image Dissector camera was found to be lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems. Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace]] laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete.<ref>Kamm and Baird, ''John Logie Baird: A Life'', pp. 286\u2013289.</ref>\n\n===Fully electronic===\n[[File:Baird first color photo.jpg|thumb|right|This live image of Paddy Naismith was used to demonstrate Baird's first all-electronic [[colour television]] system, which used two projection CRTs. The two-colour image would be similar to the basic telechrome system.]]\nBaird made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems had taken a back seat. In 1939, he showed a system known today as hybrid colour using a [[cathode ray tube]] in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by [[CBS]] and RCA in the United States.<ref name=\"Colour television\"/>\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \"[[Telechrome]]\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-colour image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). In 1941, he patented and demonstrated this system of three-dimensional television at a definition of 500 lines. On 16 August 1944, he gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic [[colour television]] display.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hempstead|first1=Colin|title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=824}}</ref> His 600-line colour system used triple [[Interlaced video|interlacing]], using six scans to build each picture.<ref name=\"Abramson\">Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13\u201314. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Colour television\">[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System]. McLean, p. 196.</ref> Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colours generated by the three guns. One of them, the [[Geer tube]], was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface.\n\nIn 1943, the Hankey Committee was appointed to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture resolution on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV ([[High-definition television|High Definition]] Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum partly due to the challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and ([[PAL]]) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Challenges of Three-Dimensional Television|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP173.pdf|agency=BBC|date=7 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Other inventions==\nSome of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful. In his twenties he tried to create [[diamonds]] by heating [[graphite]]. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst (years later this same idea was successfully adopted for [[Dr. Martens]] boots). He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.<ref name=AMH>American Media History, Fellow, p. 278</ref>\n\nIn 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed [[Phonovision]]. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved.<ref>[http://www.tvdawn.com/ \"The dawn of TV: Mechanical era of British television\"]. TVdawn.com.</ref>\n\nBaird's other developments were in [[Optical fiber|fibre-optics]], radio direction finding, [[infrared]] [[Night vision|night viewing]] and [[radar]]. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the [[UK government]]. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \"noctovision\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space.<ref>Russell Burns, John Logie Baird (N.C.: The Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2001), 119.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nFrom December 1944, Logie Baird lived at 1 Station Road, [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], East Sussex, immediately north of the station and subsequently died there on 14 June 1946 after suffering a stroke in February.<ref name=\"Hastings\">{{cite news|title=125th birthday of the inventor of television John Logie Baird|url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/local/125th-birthday-of-the-inventor-of-television-john-logie-baird-1-5436074|publisher=Hastings Observer|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref> The house was demolished in 2007 and the site is now apartments named Baird Court.<ref name=\"Hastings\"/> Logie Baird is buried beside his parents in [[Helensburgh Cemetery]], Argyll, Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnlogiebairdte0000burn/page/388 <!-- quote=Logie Baird helensburgh cemetery mother. --> ''John Logie Baird'']</ref>\n\n==Honours and portrayals==\n[[File:JOHN LOGIE BAIRD 1888-1946 Television pioneer lived here.jpg|thumb|upright|Blue plaque erected by Greater London Council at 3 Crescent Wood Road, Sydenham, London]]\nAustralian television's [[Logie Award]]s were named in honour of John Logie Baird's contribution to the invention of the television. \n\nBaird became the only deceased subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' when he was honoured by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Logie BAIRD (1888\u20131946)|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/john_logie_baird.html|website=The Big Red Book|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe was played by [[Michael Gwynn]] (and also by [[Andy Irvine (musician)#Early life and acting career|Andrew Irvine]], who played him as a boy) in the 1957 TV film ''A Voice in Vision''<ref name=\"IMDb3\">{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b802e3d5c |title=A Voice in Vision (1957) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> and by Robert McIntosh in the 1986 TV drama ''The Fools on the Hill''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164978/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title=The Fools on the Hill |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) inducted Logie Baird into The Honor Roll, which \"posthumously recognizes individuals who were not awarded Honorary Membership during their lifetimes but whose contributions would have been sufficient to warrant such an honor\".<ref>{{cite web|title=SMPTE\u00ae Announces 2014 Honorees and Award Winners |publisher=Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers|url=https://www.smpte.org/news-events/news-releases/2014honorsandawards|accessdate=10 November 2014|ref=31}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 January 2016, the search engine Google released a [[List of Google Doodles in 2016#January 26|Google Doodle]] to mark the 90th anniversary of Logie Baird's first public demonstration of live television.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Who invented the television?

While at college Baird undertook a series of engineering apprentice jobs as part of his course. The conditions in industrial Glasgow at the time helped form his socialist convictions but also contributed to his ill health. He became an agnostic, though this did not strain his relationship with his father.<ref>R. W. Burns (2000). John Logie Baird, Television Pioneer. IET. p. 10. {{ISBN|9780852967973}}. \"Even Baird's conversion to agnosticism while living at home does not appear to have stimulated a rebuke from the Reverend John Baird. Moreover, Baird was freely allowed to try to persuade others\u2014including visiting clergy\u2014to his beliefs.\"</ref> His degree course was interrupted by the [[First World War]] and he never returned to [[college graduate|graduate]].\n\nAt the beginning of 1915 he volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty. Unable to go to the Front, he took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company, which was engaged in munitions work.<ref>T. McArthur and P. Waddell, ''Vision Warrior'', Orkney Press, 1990</ref>\n\n==Television experiments==\nThe development of television was the result of work by many inventors. Among them, Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field. Many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live, moving, [[greyscale]] television image from [[reflected light]]. Baird achieved this, where other inventors had failed, by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the [[signal conditioning]] from the photocell and the video amplifier.\n\n[[File:John Logie Baird, Apparatus.jpg|thumb|left|John Logie Baird with his television apparatus, circa 1925]]\nBetween 1902 and 1907, the German physicist [[Arthur Korn]] invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells. Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still [[fax]] pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification.<ref>T. Thorne Baker, ''Wireless Pictures and Television''. London: Constable & Company, 1926., pp. 28, 29, 81.</ref> Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.<ref>Terry and Elizabeth Korn. ''Trailblazer to Television: The Story of Arthur Korn''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1950.

[[Paul Gottlieb Nipkow]] had invented this scanning disc system in 1884.<ref name=Ambramson87>Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland, 1987, pp. 13\u201315.</ref> Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow's patent \"the master television patent\".<ref name=Abramson87/> Nipkow's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium.\n[[Image:John Logie Baird and Stooky Bill.png|thumb|left|Baird in 1926 with his televisor equipment and dummies \"James\" and \"Stooky Bill\"]]\nIn early 1923, and in poor health, Baird moved to 21 Linton Crescent, [[Hastings]], on the south coast of England. He later rented a workshop in the Queen's Arcade in the town. Baird built what was to become the world's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that he purchased.<ref name=AMH/> In February 1924, he demonstrated to the ''Radio Times'' that a semi-mechanical [[analogue television]] system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Russell|title=John Logie Baird, television pioneer|date=2000|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers|location=London|isbn=9780852967973|page=[https://archive.org/details/johnlogiebairdte0000burn/page/50 50]|url=https://archive.org/details/johnlogiebairdte0000burn|url-access=registration|quote=john logie baird 1924 demonstration radio times.}}</ref> In July of the same year, he received a 1000-volt electric shock, but survived with only a burnt hand, and as a result his landlord, Mr Tree, asked him to vacate the premises.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=R.W.|title=John Logie Baird: Television Pioneer|date=2000|publisher=IET|page=59}}</ref> Baird gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at [[Selfridges]] department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Lez|title=British Television Drama: A History|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=9}}</ref>\n\nIn his laboratory on 2 October 1925, Baird successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: the head of a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed \"[[Stooky Bill]]\" in a 30-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second.<ref>R.

In addition, from 1933 Baird and the Baird Company were producing and broadcasting television programmes independently to the BBC, from Baird's studios and transmitter at the Crystal Palace in south London.<ref>Ray Herbert, ''The Crystal Palace Television Studios: John Logie Baird and British Television'', accessed online 6 January 2019 [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Link]</ref>\n\nOn 2 November 1936, from [[Alexandra Palace]] located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system, which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed and scanned. The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, due in part to a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail due in large part to the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.<ref>Kamm and Baird, ''John Logie Baird: A Life'', p. 286</ref>\n\nBaird's television systems were replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-[[Marconi Company|Marconi]] under [[Isaac Shoenberg]], which had access to patents developed by [[Vladimir Zworykin]] and [[RCA]]. Similarly, [[Philo T. Farnsworth]]'s electronic \"Image Dissector\" camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, the Image Dissector camera was found to be lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems. Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's [[Crystal Palace School|Crystal Palace]] laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete.<ref>Kamm and Baird, ''John Logie Baird: A Life'', pp. 286\u2013289.</ref>\n\n===Fully electronic===\n[[File:Baird first color photo.jpg|thumb|right|This live image of Paddy Naismith was used to demonstrate Baird's first all-electronic [[colour television]] system, which used two projection CRTs. The two-colour image would be similar to the basic telechrome system.]]\nBaird made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems had taken a back seat. In 1939, he showed a system known today as hybrid colour using a [[cathode ray tube]] in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by [[CBS]] and RCA in the United States.<ref name=\"Colour television\"/>\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \"[[Telechrome]]\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-colour image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time). In 1941, he patented and demonstrated this system of three-dimensional television at a definition of 500 lines. On 16 August 1944, he gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic [[colour television]] display.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hempstead|first1=Colin|title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=824}}</ref> His 600-line colour system used triple [[Interlaced video|interlacing]], using six scans to build each picture.<ref name=\"Abramson\">Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13\u201314. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Colour television\">[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System]. McLean, p. 196.</ref> Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colours generated by the three guns. One of them, the [[Geer tube]], was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface.\n\nIn 1943, the Hankey Committee was appointed to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture resolution on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV ([[High-definition television|High Definition]] Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum partly due to the challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and ([[PAL]]) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Challenges of Three-Dimensional Television|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP173.pdf|agency=BBC|date=7 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Other inventions==\nSome of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful. In his twenties he tried to create [[diamonds]] by heating [[graphite]]. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst (years later this same idea was successfully adopted for [[Dr. Martens]] boots). He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.<ref name=AMH>American Media History, Fellow, p. 278</ref>\n\nIn 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed [[Phonovision]]. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved.<ref>[http://www.tvdawn.com/ \"The dawn of TV: Mechanical era of British television\"]. TVdawn.com.</ref>\n\nBaird's other developments were in [[Optical fiber|fibre-optics]], radio direction finding, [[infrared]] [[Night vision|night viewing]] and [[radar]]. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the [[UK government]]. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \"noctovision\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space.<ref>Russell Burns, John Logie Baird (N.C.: The Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2001), 119.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nFrom December 1944, Logie Baird lived at 1 Station Road, [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], East Sussex, immediately north of the station and subsequently died there on 14 June 1946 after suffering a stroke in February.<ref name=\"Hastings\">{{cite news|title=125th birthday of the inventor of television John Logie Baird|url=http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/local/125th-birthday-of-the-inventor-of-television-john-logie-baird-1-5436074|publisher=Hastings Observer|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref> The house was demolished in 2007 and the site is now apartments named Baird Court.<ref name=\"Hastings\"/> Logie Baird is buried beside his parents in [[Helensburgh Cemetery]], Argyll, Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnlogiebairdte0000burn/page/388 <!-- quote=Logie Baird helensburgh cemetery mother. --> ''John Logie Baird'']</ref>\n\n==Honours and portrayals==\n[[File:JOHN LOGIE BAIRD 1888-1946 Television pioneer lived here.jpg|thumb|upright|Blue plaque erected by Greater London Council at 3 Crescent Wood Road, Sydenham, London]]\nAustralian television's [[Logie Award]]s were named in honour of John Logie Baird's contribution to the invention of the television. \n\nBaird became the only deceased subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' when he was honoured by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC Television Theatre in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Logie BAIRD (1888\u20131946)|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/john_logie_baird.html|website=The Big Red Book|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe was played by [[Michael Gwynn]] (and also by [[Andy Irvine (musician)#Early life and acting career|Andrew Irvine]], who played him as a boy) in the 1957 TV film ''A Voice in Vision''<ref name=\"IMDb3\">{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b802e3d5c |title=A Voice in Vision (1957) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> and by Robert McIntosh in the 1986 TV drama ''The Fools on the Hill''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164978/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title=The Fools on the Hill |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) inducted Logie Baird into The Honor Roll, which \"posthumously recognizes individuals who were not awarded Honorary Membership during their lifetimes but whose contributions would have been sufficient to warrant such an honor\".<ref>{{cite web|title=SMPTE\u00ae Announces 2014 Honorees and Award Winners |publisher=Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers|url=https://www.smpte.org/news-events/news-releases/2014honorsandawards|accessdate=10 November 2014|ref=31}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 January 2016, the search engine Google released a [[List of Google Doodles in 2016#January 26|Google Doodle]] to mark the 90th anniversary of Logie Baird's first public demonstration of live television.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Who invented the television?
