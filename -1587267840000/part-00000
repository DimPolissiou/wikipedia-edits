He studied violin, piano and guitar as a child and learned to play various other instruments, including the mandolin, but he concentrated on the guitar throughout his professional career. \"There was music all around us,\" he recalled, \"and in my family you'd better play something, even if you just banged on a tin can.\"<ref>Welding, Pete; Byron, Toby, eds.

As with many other early blues artists, information on Mary Johnson is often contradictory and confusing. Various online sources give her name before marriage as Mary Smith and state that she began performing in her teens. However, the writer [[James Sallis]]<ref>Sallis, James (1982). ''The Guitar Players''. Bison Books. University of Nebraska.</ref> gave her original name as Mary Williams and stated that her interest in writing and performing blues began when she started helping Lonnie write songs and developed from there.

He later said, \"I guess I would have done anything to get recorded \u2013 it just happened to be a blues contest, so I sang the blues.\"<ref name=\"manheim\"/> Between 1925 and 1932 he made about 130 recordings for Okeh, many of which sold well (making him one of the most popular OKeh artists). He was called to New York to record with the leading blues singers of the day, including [[Victoria Spivey]] and the [[country blues]] singer [[Alger \"Texas\" Alexander]]. He also toured with [[Bessie Smith]], a top attraction of the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]].<ref name=barlow/>\n\nIn December 1927, Johnson recorded in Chicago as a guest artist with [[Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five]], paired with the banjoist [[Johnny St. Cyr]]. He played on the sides \"I'm Not Rough\", \"Savoy Blues\", and \"Hotter Than That.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section2 |title=The Louis Armstrong Discography |publisher=Michaelminn.net |accessdate=30 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902201730/http://michaelminn.net/armstrong/index.php?section2 |archivedate=September 2, 2011  }}</ref> In an unusual move, he was invited to sit in with many OKeh jazz groups.

He pioneered the guitar solo on the 1927 track \"6/88 Glide\",<ref name=cohassey/> and on many of his early recordings he played [[12-string guitar]] solos in a style that influenced such future jazz guitarists as [[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] and gave the instrument new meaning as a jazz voice. He excelled in purely instrumental pieces, some of which he recorded with the white jazz guitarist [[Eddie Lang]], with whom he teamed in 1929. These recordings were among the first to feature black and white musicians performing together, although Lang was credited as Blind Willie Dunn to disguise the fact.<ref name=\"manheim\"/>\n\nMuch of Johnson's music featured experimental improvisations that would now be categorized as jazz rather than blues. According to the blues historian G\u00e9rard Herzhaft,<ref name=\"Herzhaft\"/> Johnson was \"undeniably the creator of the guitar solo played note by note with a pick, which has become the standard in jazz, blues, country, and rock\". Johnson's style reached both the [[Delta blues]]men and urban players who would adapt and develop his one-string solos into the modern electric blues style.<ref name=cohassey/> However, the writer [[Elijah Wald]]<ref>Wald, Elijah (2004). ''Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues''. {{ISBN|978-0-06-052427-2}}.</ref> declared that in the 1920s and 1930s Johnson was best known as a sophisticated and urbane singer rather than an instrumentalist: \"Of the forty ads for his records that appeared in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' between 1926 and 1931, not one even mentioned that he played guitar.\"\n\nJohnson's compositions often depicted the social conditions confronting urban African Americans (\"Racketeers' Blues\", \"Hard Times Ain't Gone Nowhere\", \"Fine Booze and Heavy Dues\").<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In his lyrics he captured the nuances of male-female love relationships in a way that went beyond [[Tin Pan Alley]] sentimentalism.<ref name=\"Devil\"/> His songs displayed an ability to understand the heartaches of others, which Johnson saw as the essence of his blues.<ref name=barlow/>\n\nAfter touring with [[Bessie Smith]] in 1929, Johnson moved to Chicago and recorded for Okeh with the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]. However, with the temporary demise of the recording industry in the [[Great Depression]], he was compelled to make a living outside music, working at one point in a steel mill in [[Peoria, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In 1932 he moved again, to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where he lived for the rest of the decade. There he performed on radio programs and intermittently played with the band backing the singer Putney Dandridge.<ref name=cohassey/>\n\nBy the late 1930s, he was recording and performing in Chicago for [[Decca Records]], working with [[Roosevelt Sykes]] and [[Blind John Davis]], among others. In 1939, during a session for [[Bluebird Records]] with the pianist [[Joshua Altheimer]], Johnson used an electric guitar for the first time.<ref name=\"manheim\"/> He recorded 34 tracks for Bluebird over the next five years, including the hits \"He's a Jelly Roll Baker\"<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=13|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and \"In Love Again\".<ref name=cohassey/>\n\n===Later career===\n [[File:Lonnie Johnson at my place 1960.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lonnie Johnson posing with his guitar|Johnson in 1960]]\nAfter World War II, Johnson made the transition to [[rhythm and blues]], recording for [[King Records (USA)|King]] in Cincinnati and having a hit in 1948 with \"[[Tomorrow Night (Coslow and Grosz song)|Tomorrow Night]]\" written by [[Sam Coslow]] and [[Wilhelm Grosz|Will Grosz]]. The topped the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Race Records]] chart for 7 weeks and reached number 19 on the pop chart with sales of three million copies.<ref name=\"manheim\"/> A [[blues ballad]] with piano accompaniment and background singers, the song bore little resemblance to much of Johnson's earlier blues and jazz material.

''Top R&B Singles 1942\u20131995''. {{ISBN|0-89820-115-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Johnson toured England.

These recordings were among the first to feature black and white musicians performing together, although Lang was credited as Blind Willie Dunn to disguise the fact.<ref name=\"manheim\"/>\n\nMuch of Johnson's music featured experimental improvisations that would now be categorized as jazz rather than blues. According to the blues historian G\u00e9rard Herzhaft,<ref name=\"Herzhaft\"/> Johnson was \"undeniably the creator of the guitar solo played note by note with a pick, which has become the standard in jazz, blues, country, and rock\". Johnson's style reached both the [[Delta blues]]men and urban players who would adapt and develop his one-string solos into the modern electric blues style.<ref name=cohassey/> However, the writer [[Elijah Wald]]<ref>Wald, Elijah (2004). ''Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues''. {{ISBN|978-0-06-052427-2}}.</ref> declared that in the 1920s and 1930s Johnson was best known as a sophisticated and urbane singer rather than an instrumentalist: \"Of the forty ads for his records that appeared in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' between 1926 and 1931, not one even mentioned that he played guitar.\"\n\nJohnson's compositions often depicted the social conditions confronting urban African Americans (\"Racketeers' Blues\", \"Hard Times Ain't Gone Nowhere\", \"Fine Booze and Heavy Dues\").<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In his lyrics he captured the nuances of male-female love relationships in a way that went beyond [[Tin Pan Alley]] sentimentalism.<ref name=\"Devil\"/> His songs displayed an ability to understand the heartaches of others, which Johnson saw as the essence of his blues.<ref name=barlow/>\n\nAfter touring with [[Bessie Smith]] in 1929, Johnson moved to Chicago and recorded for Okeh with the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]. However, with the temporary demise of the recording industry in the [[Great Depression]], he was compelled to make a living outside music, working at one point in a steel mill in [[Peoria, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Devil\"/> In 1932 he moved again, to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where he lived for the rest of the decade.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Their work renewed interest in biolinguistics, catalysing many linguists to look into biolinguistics with their colleagues in adjacent scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Sciullo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=The Biolinguistic Enterprise: New Perspectives on the Evolution and Nature of the Human Language Faculty Volume 1 of Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2011 |isbn=9780199553273 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6REUDAAAQBAJ&dq=origins+of+biolinguistics}}</ref> Both Jenkins and Uriagereka stressed the importance of addressing the emergence of the language faculty in humans. At around the same time, [[geneticist]]s discovered a link between the language deficit manifest by the [[KE family]] members and the gene [[FOXP2]]. Although FOXP2 is not the gene responsible for language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why Only Us|date=2016|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262333351|doi = 10.7551/mitpress/10684.001.0001}}</ref> this discovery brought many linguists and scientists together to interpret this data, renewing the interest of biolinguistics.\n\nAlthough many linguists have differing opinions when it comes to the history of biolinguistics, Chomsky believes that its history was simply that of [[transformational grammar]]. While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Blackwell Publishers</ref>\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\".

[[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>.\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n==== Chomsky's Theories ====\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values). It also contends that humans possess generative grammar, which is hard-wired into the human brain in some ways and makes it possible for young children to do the rapid and universal acquisition of speech.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert K |title=The extended mind : the emergence of language, the human mind, and culture |date=2007 |publisher=Toronto : University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802093035 }}</ref> Elements of linguistic variation then determine the growth of language in the individual, and variation is the result of experience, given the genetic endowment and independent principles reducing complexity.\n\n=====Language Acquisition Device=====\n\n{{Main|Language Acquisition}}\n\nProposed by Chomsky in the 1960s, the [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was purported to be an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Proponents\nof the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being\nexposed to a rich linguistic environment.\n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Blackwell Publishers</ref>\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP |last=Soschen |first=Alona |date=2006 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nRecent work in [[theoretical linguistics]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive studies]] construes human language as a highly non-redundant species-specific system. [[Noam Chomsky]]'s latest contribution to the study of language is his minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by Elizabeth Wates and Brian MacWhinney, the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representatonal character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

This human biological endowment for language acquisition is known as [[Universal Grammar|Universal Grammar (UG)]], which is also considered as the initial state of the Language Acquisition Device.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crain |first1=Stephen |last2=Koring |first2=Loes |last3=Thornton |first3=Rosalind |title=Language acquisition from a biolinguistic perspective |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2017 |volume=81 |issue=Pt B |pages=120\u2013149 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.004|pmid=27633153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Berwick |first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky |first2=Noam |title=Why only us: Language and evolution |date=2016 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=9780262034241 |pages=89\u2013108}}</ref> UG contains core principles that are common to all languages and information on the ways that each language differs, and information on the language variations are encoded in parameters. As a result, UG can be summed up as a system of [[principles and parameters]], a model proposed by Chomsky. The goal of biolinguists, with regard to language acquisition, is to come up with the formulation of genetic principles of UG narrowly enough constrained to account for the child\u2019s ability to learn structural properties of grammar of great subtlety from impoverished linguistic data and at the same time, find parameters that can account for manifest variations among different languages.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Lyle |title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the biology of language |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York, NY |pages=76\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nSome of the areas of study of language acquisition include:\n\n*Determine what the set of parameters are that are found in UG\n*[[Word order]]\n\nIn language acquisition, one of the arguments supporting the biolinguistic view is [[poverty of the stimulus]],<ref name=\"project muse\" /><ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> a term coined by Chomsky in 1980, which contends that the linguistic environment that children are exposed to is not rich enough to account for all the information that they have acquired. In other words, children have only heard a finite number of sentences, but they are able to comprehend and produce an infinite number of sentences. This argument is often used to argue against the [[usage-based linguistics|usage-based]] approach of language acquisition, which denies the necessity of UG and argues children can learn languages through their general cognitive and social skills,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomasello|first=Michael|date=2005-01-12|title=Beyond formalities: The case of language acquisition|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2\u20134|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.183|issn=0167-6318}}</ref> as it is able to account for the use of grammar that the child is not exposed to.\n\nIn the following sections, some of the aspects of language that develop will be discussed from a biolinguistic stand-point. These areas will draw similarities to language acquisition and UG.\n\n===Typology===\n\n{{Main|Linguistic typology}}\n\nLinguistic typology is the analysis, comparison, and classification of languages according to their common structural features and forms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Linguistic typology |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-linguistic-typology-1691129 |date=19 February 2019}}</ref> Linguistic typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features, and it aims to describe and explain the structural diversity and similarity in the languages of the world.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=English Language and Linguistics Online |title=Linguistic typology & typological universals |url=http://www.ello.uos.de/field.php/CognitiveApproaches/LinguisticTypologyAndTypologicalUniversals}}</ref>\n\nThe study of linguistic typology is thus in line with the goal of biolinguists in language acquisition as mentioned previously. It also draws comparisons with UG in the sense that they both seek to identify the similarities and differences in the languages of the world. There is some evidence from this field that suggests that the structure of the world's languages may not be completely random from a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistc]] point of view <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trudgill |first1=Peter |title=The impact of language contact and social structure on linguistic structure: Focus on the dialects of modern Greek |journal=Dialectology Meets Typology: Dialect Grammar from a Cross-linguistic Perspective |date=2004 |volume=153 |pages=435\u2013452}}</ref> and this supports the view of UG.\n\nSome of the areas that linguistic typology looks at are:\n*[[Phonology|Phonological systems]]\n*Word order\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*Semantics<ref>Kemp, Charles & Xu, Yang & Regier, Terry (2018). \"Semantic Typology and Efficient Communication\". ''Annual Review of Linguistics''. '''4''': 109-128.</ref>\n\n===Syntax===\n\n{{Main|Syntax}}\n\nSyntax is the part of the language that includes the rules that govern the grammatical organization of words and phrases. [[Generative grammar]] considers it the central object of the study and this is the only component of the human language that allows for creative properties.<ref name=Scianna>{{cite journal |last1=Scianna |first1=Caterina |title=The biolinguistic approach to the study of language nature |url=https://www.academia.edu/8452191}}</ref> It is because of this creativity allowed by syntax that provided the phrase, famously used by Chomsky, ''[[Colourless green ideas sleep furiously]]'' in his book [[Syntactic Structures]] which demonstrated a grammatically correct phrase that made no sense. This example provided by Chomsky is also evidence of poverty of the stimulus because this phrase is one that most likely did not exist in his environment, yet he was able to produce it.\n\nThis idea, which is a syntactic principle in UG, is called [[Dependency grammar|structure-dependency]]. Structure-dependency means that the sentence is influenced by its structure and not just the order of words.<ref name=\"Scianna\" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordguist |first1=Richard |title=Structure dependency and linguistics |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/structure-dependency-grammar-1691997 |date=4 March 2019}}</ref> This ability to understand and use structure-dependency is not derived from experience and is instead a set of principles that regulate the acquisition of language.\n\n===Artificial Grammar Learning===\n[[Artificial grammar learning]] (AGL) lies in the intersection between cognitive psychology and linguistics. AGL tests are administered to evaluate humans' cognitive process and pattern-detection in a language learning context. Participants are required to learn a made-up grammar in a sterile setting and sounds, symbols, or both are used to represent\ngrammar structures. Results of AGL tests are used to gain an insight to how humans learn and interpret grammar.\n\n=== Biolinguistics: challenging the Usage-Based approach ===\nAs mentioned above, Biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the Biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078}}</ref>.\n\n==Researchers in Biolinguistics==\n\n*[[Alec Marantz]], [[NYU]]/[[MIT]]\n*[[Andrew Carnie]], [[University of Arizona]]\n*[[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]], [[University of Quebec at Montreal]]\n*[https://antoniobenitez.wixsite.com/benitez-burraco Antonio-Benitez Burraco], [[University of Seville]]\n*[https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/cedric-boeckx--493 Cedric Boeckx], [[Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies|Catalan institute for Advanced Studies]]\n*[[Charles Reiss]], [[Concordia University]]\n*[[David Berlinski]], [[Discovery Institute]]\n*[[David Poeppel]], [[NYU]]\n*[[Derek Bickerton]], [[University of Hawaii]]\n*[[Marc D.
