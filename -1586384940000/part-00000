While primarily a first baseman, Branyan was capable of playing [[third base]] and the [[outfield]], as well. \n\nBranyan began his professional career in the Cleveland Indians minor league system. He made his big league debut with the Indians, on September 26, 1998. Ranked as the Indians' top prospect in 1999 by ''[[Baseball America]]''. Though he demonstrated the ability to hit [[home run]]s with Cleveland, his [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]] was low. Indians' manager [[Charlie Manuel]] suggested in 2002 that Branyan could benefit from more playing time, but he was traded to the Reds for prospect [[Ben Broussard]] during the season. Excited to have a \"clean slate,\" as he put it, Branyan hit 16 home runs with the Reds in 2002 but struggled with injuries in the 2003 campaign. Allowed to become a [[free agent]], he spent 2004 in the minor leagues for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and Cleveland before Milwaukee picked him up on July 26. In 51 games for the Brewers, Branyan hit 11 home runs. He competed with [[Wes Helms]] for the starting spot at third base in 2005 but again battled injuries much of the season. Branyan signed with the Devil Rays in 2006 and spent most of the year on their roster, but he expressed concern at the fact that he was not an everyday player with Tampa Bay. Traded to the Padres in August, he hit what was at the time the longest home run in [[Petco Park]] history, measured at 453 feet. He batted .197 for the Padres in 2007 and was released July 28. Branyan spent brief stints with the Phillies and Cardinals that season before becoming a free agent at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2008, Branyan split the season between Milwaukee and the minor leagues, hitting 12 home runs at both destinations while serving in a [[Platoon (sports)|platoon]] role with [[Bill Hall (utility player)|Bill Hall]] in Milwaukee. With the Mariners in 2009, Branyan started doing eye exercises with an ophthalmologist. He attributed them to his most successful year in the major leagues thus far, when he hit a career-high 31 home runs while serving as an everyday player much of the season. Branyan signed with the Indians again in 2010. After starting the year on the disabled list, he hit 10 home runs for them before getting traded back to Seattle. With 15 home runs for the Mariners, Branyan finished the year with 25. He signed with the Diamondbacks in 2011, but only batted .197 with them and the Angels, with whom he finished the year. Branyan played in the minor leagues in 2012, did not play at all in 2013, and finished his career with time in the [[Mexican League]] and the Indians' system in 2014.\n\n==Baseball career==\n\n===High school===\nBranyan was a 1994 graduate from [[Stratford Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|title=Baseball: Eagles in College/Pros|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025094134/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|archivedate=October 25, 2007}}</ref> His high school fostered such athletic talent like professional football player [[Le Kevin Smith]] and professional golfer [[Peter Persons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|title=Stratford Athletic Hall of Fame|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124083226/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Branyan was selected as an All-Georgia State player in both 1993 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|title=All State Players|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716004102/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> He was drafted out of Stratford Academy in the [[1994 Major League Baseball draft]] by the Cleveland Indians in the seventh round (185th pick overall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/draft.jsp?year=1994|title=1994 Draft \u2013 June Regular Phase|author=|date=|work=Major League Baseball|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nBranyan began his professional career with the rookie-level [[Burlington Indians]] of the [[Appalachian League]] in {{baseball year|1994}}.

While primarily a first baseman, Branyan was capable of playing [[third base]] and the [[outfield]], as well. \n\nBranyan began his professional career in the Cleveland Indians minor league system. He made his big league debut with the Indians, on September 26, 1998. Ranked as the Indians' top prospect in 1999 by ''[[Baseball America]]''. Though he demonstrated the ability to hit [[home run]]s with Cleveland, his [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]] was low. Indians' manager [[Charlie Manuel]] suggested in 2002 that Branyan could benefit from more playing time, but he was traded to the Reds for prospect [[Ben Broussard]] during the season. Excited to have a \"clean slate,\" as he put it, Branyan hit 16 home runs with the Reds in 2002 but struggled with injuries in the 2003 campaign. Allowed to become a [[free agent]], he spent 2004 in the minor leagues for the [[Atlanta Braves]] and Cleveland before Milwaukee picked him up on July 26. In 51 games for the Brewers, Branyan hit 11 home runs. He competed with [[Wes Helms]] for the starting spot at third base in 2005 but again battled injuries much of the season. Branyan signed with the Devil Rays in 2006 and spent most of the year on their roster, but he expressed concern at the fact that he was not an everyday player with Tampa Bay. Traded to the Padres in August, he hit what was at the time the longest home run in [[Petco Park]] history, measured at 453 feet. He batted .197 for the Padres in 2007 and was released July 28. Branyan spent brief stints with the Phillies and Cardinals that season before becoming a free agent at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2008, Branyan split the season between Milwaukee and the minor leagues, hitting 12 home runs at both destinations while serving in a [[Platoon (sports)|platoon]] role with [[Bill Hall (utility player)|Bill Hall]] in Milwaukee. With the Mariners in 2009, Branyan started doing eye exercises with an ophthalmologist. He attributed them to his most successful year in the major leagues thus far, when he hit a career-high 31 home runs while serving as an everyday player much of the season. Branyan signed with the Indians again in 2010. After starting the year on the disabled list, he hit 10 home runs for them before getting traded back to Seattle. With 15 home runs for the Mariners, Branyan finished the year with 25. He signed with the Diamondbacks in 2011, but only batted .197 with them and the Angels, with whom he finished the year. Branyan played in the minor leagues in 2012, did not play at all in 2013, and finished his career with time in the [[Mexican League]] and the Indians' system in 2014.\n\n==Baseball career==\n\n===High school===\nBranyan was a 1994 graduate from [[Stratford Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|title=Baseball: Eagles in College/Pros|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025094134/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=316|archivedate=October 25, 2007}}</ref> His high school fostered such athletic talent like professional football player [[Le Kevin Smith]] and professional golfer [[Peter Persons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|title=Stratford Athletic Hall of Fame|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124083226/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=1688|archivedate=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Branyan was selected as an All-Georgia State player in both 1993 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|title=All State Players|work=Stratford Academy|publisher=stratford.org|accessdate=January 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716004102/http://www.stratford.org/page.cfm?p=501|archivedate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> He was drafted out of Stratford Academy in the [[1994 Major League Baseball draft]] by the Cleveland Indians in the seventh round (185th pick overall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/draft.jsp?year=1994|title=1994 Draft \u2013 June Regular Phase|author=|date=|work=Major League Baseball|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nBranyan began his professional career with the rookie-level [[Burlington Indians]] of the [[Appalachian League]] in {{baseball year|1994}}.

It is squeezed out of a tube directly into the mouth, instead of being eaten with a spoon.  It was introduced by the [[General Mills]]-licensed brand [[Yoplait]] in 1998, as the first yogurt made specifically for children. DANIMALS IS BETTER< YOU TWINK\n\n==Background==\nStephen Kaufman of Green Bay, WI, a food scientist, and Jim McGuire, a research and development technician, came up with the invention while working for General Mills in the late 1980s, after Kaufman was browsing through a women's magazine and seeing shampoo samples inserts.<ref name=\"citypages\">{{cite news|last1=Kaufman |first1=Jared |title=The St. Paul-based inventor of Go-Gurt tells the dramatic story of his totally tubular idea |url=http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/the-st-paul-based-inventor-of-go-gurt-tells-the-dramatic-story-of-his-totally-tubular-idea/492530701 |magazine=City Pages |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> The original idea was based off frozen ice pops. Kaufman told the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] magazine ''[[City Pages]]'' that the original conception was for the yogurt to be firm, so the tube would stand straight up \u2014 like an ice pop \u2014 but when that didn't work out, they shifted toward a creamy  yogurt.\n\nThe original idea faced internal opposition at General Mills. Kaufman used hotel shampoo pouches as an inspiration to create prototypes of Go-Gurt, which he made himself on a personal-care product pouching machine he rented, to convince General Mills engineers of the idea's worthiness.<ref name=citypages/>\n\nGo-Gurt became a side option in [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]s in 2014 in strawberry flavor<ref>https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2014/05/20/McDonald-s-Happy-Meal-Go-GURT-deal-great-opportunity-General-Mills</ref>.\n\nAnthropologist Susan Squires claims that her ethnographic research in U.S. American families led her client to the development of Go-GURT.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Squires, Susan & Byrne, Bryan |title= Creating Breakthrough Ideas: The Collaboration of Anthropologists and Designers in the Product Development Industry|date= 2002}} 239 pages.</ref>\n\n==Sub-brands==\nIn June 2006, '''frubes Fizzix''', a carbonated yogurt snack, was released under the Yoplait brand.

It was introduced by the [[General Mills]]-licensed brand [[Yoplait]] in 1998, as the first yogurt made specifically for children.\n\n==Background==\nStephen Kaufman of Green Bay, WI, a food scientist, and Jim McGuire, a research and development technician, came up with the invention while working for General Mills in the late 1980s, after Kaufman was browsing through a women's magazine and seeing shampoo samples inserts.<ref name=\"citypages\">{{cite news|last1=Kaufman |first1=Jared |title=The St. Paul-based inventor of Go-Gurt tells the dramatic story of his totally tubular idea |url=http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/the-st-paul-based-inventor-of-go-gurt-tells-the-dramatic-story-of-his-totally-tubular-idea/492530701 |magazine=City Pages |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> The original idea was based off frozen ice pops. Kaufman told the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] magazine ''[[City Pages]]'' that the original conception was for the yogurt to be firm, so the tube would stand straight up \u2014 like an ice pop \u2014 but when that didn't work out, they shifted toward a creamy  yogurt.\n\nThe original idea faced internal opposition at General Mills. Kaufman used hotel shampoo pouches as an inspiration to create prototypes of Go-Gurt, which he made himself on a personal-care product pouching machine he rented, to convince General Mills engineers of the idea's worthiness.<ref name=citypages/>\n\nGo-Gurt became a side option in [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]]s in 2014 in strawberry flavor<ref>https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2014/05/20/McDonald-s-Happy-Meal-Go-GURT-deal-great-opportunity-General-Mills</ref>.\n\nAnthropologist Susan Squires claims that her ethnographic research in U.S. American families led her client to the development of Go-GURT.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Squires, Susan & Byrne, Bryan |title= Creating Breakthrough Ideas: The Collaboration of Anthropologists and Designers in the Product Development Industry|date= 2002}} 239 pages.</ref>\n\n==Sub-brands==\nIn June 2006, '''frubes Fizzix''', a carbonated yogurt snack, was released under the Yoplait brand.
