Police brutality is often catalyzed by the aim to achieve political desirable ends. Over the recent past police use of excessive force has been a subject of public dissertation. This paper will explore the causes of police brutality, effects and how to curb them. This will help to minimize police brutality.\nCauses of police brutality\nPolice officers have authority to use force, therefore their superiors and the general public expects them to do so. This is in regards to dealing with disorderly individuals and groups at societal level. Due to this police believe that they are way above the laws of the land in many countries as provided by use of continuum. This refers to customary that provides police officers and civilians with guidelines on how force should be applied against the counterattacking subjects in diverse circumstances. This power is typically approved by the respective governments with few limits set out from the common law. Based on this continuum police officers are likely to misinterpret the law and apply excessive force on civilians leading to injuries of civilians and even deaths, police will then justify their brutal acts by claiming that it is provided by the use of force continuum hence use of force continuum justifies the use of force by police.\n\n Psychopathy makes some police officers use unrestrained force. This refers to people with personality disorder indicated by a pattern of arrogance, disregard for morality, lack of acceptance of responsibility, lack of empathy, such people are prone to violence. In the case police officers based on this factor of psychopathy they are likely to disregard the law that safeguard the civilians and the law guiding them and go ahead with harming the civilians with use of excessive force on civilians, they will also disregard the general morality of the society and show sense of arrogance with the use of excessive force. Therefore psychopathy is one of the causes of police brutality.\n\tAmong the police, there are aspects that police are expect themselves to conform to. Conformity to police culture is also another cause of police brutal acts. Example of police culture is \u2018\u2019 the blue code of silence\u2019\u2019, this refers to the informal rule among the police officers not to take legal action against their fellow officers in service due to crimes they committed and police misconducts. This will enable police officers who are on duty not to report their fellow police officers in case of misconduct such as brutal force application. They are likely to claim that they are ignorant of what other officers have done or make a claim that they didn\u2019t see anything. Due to this factor police officers will engage in application of excessive force against the civilians knowing that they are protected by their fellow colleagues in service or they will not be  witness against them, thus giving them justification of using excessive force against the civilians, hence brutal actions of police are caused by conformity to police culture.\nDuring high-speed pursuit of suspects, police officers are likely to be filled with adrenaline when they become angry; this is likely to affect their judgment when they have the ability to confront the suspect after tiresome and time consuming pursuit chase. The resulting loss of proper judgment and heightened emotion will be likely to result in an inappropriate application of force on the suspects, this effects has been termed as high-speed pursuit syndrome. Thus anger leads to police brutality.\nSome of the police brutality is based on racial differentiation. Some police officers treat civilians based on their races, some of these officers develop hatred against other races. Due to this police officers are likely to use torturous means when confronting an individual from a different race from his/her own race. Therefore racial differentiation is a cause of police brutality.\nStress among police officers also contributes to brutal acts. According to minaar and misty (2006) police torturous ways is mostly related to officer\u2019s wellbeing for example stress, in the interview they conducted at Gauteng province found out that the reason why police use force is due to underlying stress. When an individual is under the effects of stress he/she is likely to use force unwittingly. This case is not different in police officers also thus they use excessive force due to underlying stress.\nEffects of police brutality on civilians\n\nPolice brutality leads to severe mental and physical injury. Due to use of force, civilians are likely to sustain physical injuries such as those that results in crimes like assault and homicide. These injuries usually results due to baton beatings, shootings and whippings. Examples of physical injuries that occur due to police brutality include skin abrasion, bone fracturing, nerve injuries, skull fracturing. These injuries will result to further complications in future including post-traumatic cerebral edema, epilepsy, paralysis, permanent disability and even death.\nThe damage caused by police brutality can prolong beyond physical injury manifestations. Victims are likely to be faced with trauma which manifests itself in myriad ways, these include stress, anxiety, fear, distrust, depression and insomnia. These psychological effects caused by police brutality can manifest further as acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, this stress will further consume facets of victim\u2019s lives affecting the job performance and ability to sustain his/ her employment. Therefore police brutality extends beyond physical manifestations.\n\tPolice brutality also creates tidal waves of chaos. As a result of police violence in presence civilians, police officers will be confronted by the civilians. Civilians will tend to confront police using crude weapons such as throwing stones and vandalizing property to use as weapons to attack them. This will have fueled community war against the police; hence police use of force will create tidal waves of chaos.\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to curb police brutality and its effects\n\tUnderstand civilian rights. If a civilian doesn\u2019t understand his/her right, they will be forced to believe that many wrong doing misconducts of police officers are right. In this case civilians won\u2019t even know that they are being victimized. Knowing rights as a civilian will help you take further steps against police brutality. For a civilian to know his/her rights, they can visit police department and inquire about citizens\u2019 rights. Or they can get a copy of constitution and criminal law code for your state and country. This act of equipping yourself with knowledge of rights is the defense against police brutality.\nTo restrain psychopathy and stress among the police officers. Police officers should be taken through guidance and counseling sessions. During training of police officers, a counselor should be made available for them, in order to provide them with adequate knowledge of curing their personality when in service. Police officers who are undergoing stress should also be taken through counseling services to curb their stress this will limit the police use of excessive force brought about by stress and psychopathy.\nIn order to reduce violence among the police officers, the force continuum should provide clear ways of handling civilians in different situations. These situations include how to deal with individuals who are rioting, in case of theft and during high speed pursuit of individuals. If law enforcement is clearly stated the police officers are likely to follow these rules and it will also allow for the judgment of police against brutality.\nConclusion\nPolice brutality is seen as an act where police officers apply excessive force against the civilians. This application of excessive force is caused by underlying factors among the police officers such as use of force continuum, stress psychopathy and anger. Due to this application of excessive force it leads to physical injuries such as skin bruises, skull damage and even limbs fracturing. These physical injuries might further lead to stresses among the individuals. To curb this police should be provided with guidance and counseling therapy sessions during their service and when they are undergoing training this will help to curb psychopathy and stress among them.\n\n== History ==\nThe term \"police brutality\" was first used by American newspapers in 1872, when the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Police Brutality: A Prisoner was shamefully beaten by Officers, he was Kicked and Pounded in a Cell ---Probably Fatally Injured|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=October 12, 1872}}</ref> reported the beating of a civilian under arrest at the Harrison Street Police Station.\n\nThe origin of modern policing (based on the authority of the [[nation-state]]) can be traced back to 18th century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in many nations by the 19th and early 20th centuries. Early records suggest that labor strikes were the first large-scale incidents of police brutality in the United States, including events like the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919|Great Steel Strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.\n\nIn the United States, it is common for marginalized groups to perceive the police as [[oppression|oppressors]], rather than protectors or enforcers of the law, due to the statistically disproportionate number of minority incarcerations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Mary D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=56\u201360|chapter=Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>\n\nHubert Locke wrote:\n\n<blockquote>When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as \"alley court\"\u2014the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[Police station|station house]].<ref>{{cite journal|volume=44|publisher=J.

This incident led to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] commenced and resulted in 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing a federal trial, two of the four officers were convicted and received 32-month prison sentences. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011) showed that from 2003 to 2009 at least 4,813 people died while being arrested by local police. Of the deaths classified as [[law enforcement]] homicides, there were 2,876 deaths; of those, 1,643 or 57.1% of the deaths were \"people of color\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Being Arrested can be Hazardous to your Health, Especially if you are a Person of Color|url=http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/being-arrested-can-be-hazardous-your-health-especially-if-you-are-person-color}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Main|List of cases of police brutality}}\n\n===Austria===\nIn Vienna, there is an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants, which have led to African migrants being racially profiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|title=Reactions to Police Brutality|access-date=2016-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818090904/http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere have been a number of highly publicized incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people{{emdash}}in some cases to the point of death.

Amnesty suggested that while the involvement of NGOs is valuable, more work needs to be done by the government to reduce negative social stereotypes that lead to prejudice, racial profiling, and hatred that leads to police brutality. One suggestion is to disband the ''Bereitschaftspolizei'', Vienna's riot police, as they have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality.<ref name=\":16\" /> Amnesty also suggested that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action){{emdash}}something which they have previously refused to do.<ref name=\"amnestyusa1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-austria-2013|title=Annual Report: Austria 2013|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}\nMany people have been viciously beaten by police in [[Bangladesh]].

The Carabineros special forces team '''Comando Jungla''' was in the [[Araucan\u00eda Region]] searching for terrorists. After seeing Camilo \"attacking\" policemen with a gun in an attempt to escape, the Carabineros shot Camilo in the head and killed him. It was later discovered that this was not what happened; a partner of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he drove a tractor. Carabineros was asked why they did not have a recording of the officer being shot at by Camilo.

One of the first documented incidents dates back to 1976, where 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. In 1980, 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou died at the hands of the Greek police. He was beaten to death by police officers during a demonstration commemorating the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]]. The protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. The protests are still commonly affected police brutality around the time of the event.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fragkiska-megaloudi/growing-police-brutality-in-greece_b_2636529.html|title=Growing Police Brutality in Greece: The Hidden Face of the Crisis|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-22|date=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\n====Increase====\nThe level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years have been profound. Due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. Greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. It was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the police's press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection{{emdash}}Nikos Dendias{{emdash}}supported the police and claimed that they needed to use Photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/> In October 2012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party \"Golden Dawn\". Victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the Attica General Police Directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. Dendias countered by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on the Guardian report the next day were fired.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Recent instances====\nPolice brutality in Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which took place on November 17, 2014.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/amnesty-international-condemns-greek-police-brutality|title=Amnesty International condemns Greek police brutality {{!}}thetoc.gr|date=2014-11-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref> Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range \u2013 in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in the hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they laughed.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\nVideo footage confirmed that on 13 November 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/> Amnesty International called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of \"abuse and impunity\" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\nA German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. The student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/> The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\n====Examples====\n* '''May 2011''': student Yannis Kafkas suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n* '''June 2011''': Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade at him and caused him to suffer from permanent hearing loss.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n*'''February 2012''': photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery done after being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was allegedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nThere have been instances where protesters were used as human shields \u2013 a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nNone of the cases of police brutality above resulted in any prosecution of police force members. One case that sparked nationwide riots was the death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens.

Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Protestors and non-violent civilians passing by were targeted, tackled, and injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man and raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters and paramedics.\n\n====Prevention====\nHungarian Spectrum blogger Eva S. Bologh suggest that rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to the proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force.

Given this state of events, the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections.<ref>Conway, V & Walshe, D  'Current Developments in Police Governance and Accountability in Ireland [[Crime, Law and Social Change]], Published online, 9 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\n[[Latvia]] became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, consisting of a group of volunteers to protect public order.<ref>Melnis, E, Garonskis, A & Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija''</ref> Policing during this period was quite successful and was assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1991, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were overruled by the Communist Regime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Melnis | first1 = E | last2 = Garonskis | first2 = A | last3 = Matvejevs | first3 = A | year = 2006 | title = Development of the Policing in Latvia | url = | journal = Jurisprudencija | volume = 1 | issue = 79| pages = 72\u201384 }}</ref> Due to Soviet ideals on policing that considered criminals to be the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist ideologies. During this time, an imbalance existed between police actions and citizens' rights. Despite the lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue, as illustrated by the case where the former head of police Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment in this time period for genocide against the Latvian people.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 190.</ref>\n\nIn 1991, independence of the state of Latvia was restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the ''Law on Police'' on June 5. This restructured the police into State, Security, and Local Government levels. The ''Law on Police'' reiterated ethical requirements, where police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to \"torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment\". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose among the Russian population living in Latvia; in 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 192.</ref> This hostility towards Russians remained in the following years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after Latvia's independence.\n\nIn 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies (LCHRES) found some instances of brutality and \"severe abuse\" within police authorities, especially on persons in custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm|title=Latvia|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> Reports showed high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">U.S Department of State: Diplomacy in Action, 2006, Latvia, accessed 19 July 2016 <nowiki>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm United States Department of State]</nowiki>.</ref> For the Latvian community, this meant that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.\n\nReports from Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study where it set up an anonymous hotline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/en/projects/prevention-of-torture/|title=Prevention of Torture {{!}} Latvian Centre for Human Rights|website=cilvektiesibas.org.lv|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.\n\nSince joining the European Union in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system a number of times. While the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities did not enact any of their 2007 recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/news-2013/-/asset_publisher/TEHtOeUO1Ozc/content/latvia-should-address-ill-treatment-by-police-and-improve-detention-conditions|title=Latvia should address ill-treatment by police and improve detention conditions|website=www.coe.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> Their 2011 report outlined some cases of police brutality within the prison system, with allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly while being apprehended or at the police station (including during questioning).\n\nDespite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for poor treatment is decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states \"a police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim.

The first anniversary of his death in June 2019 provided a catalyst for protests against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European background. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, which led some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest.

Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes. \n\nA recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named \"Rao Anwar\".

[[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]] writes in regards to dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|author2=Fyfe, James D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=45\u201355|chapter=Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>\n\nThere are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more inclined to use excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists surveyed officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. These include personality disorders; previous traumatic job-related experience; young, inexperienced, or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles; and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorized these groups and separated the group that was the most likely to use excessive force.<ref>Scrivner, 1994: 3\u20136</ref> However, this \"bad apple paradigm\" is considered by some to be an \"easy way out\".

This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].\n\nViolence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Police brutality is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).\n\nStudies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as \"vigilantism\", where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.<ref>Chevigny, P. (2008). \"Police Brutality\", In Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict. oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology, 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally apprehend the suspect. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force.

As a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the black society created many social organizations, such as the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement founded in 2013, which made a social impact on the world in response to the violent and systematic racism that black people still face by police officers.\n\nWhile the Justice Department reported that Cleveland police officers used \"excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists\" on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hines|first=Sandra|date=2017-09-21|chapter=Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality|publisher=Policy Press|doi=10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019|isbn=9781447327868|title=Why Detroit Matters}}</ref>\n\n==== Black Americans and the US police ====\n\nIn a report released concerning the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown shooting]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], the Justice Department admitted to the Ferguson's police department's pattern of racial bias. The department argued that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. The Justice Department explained police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers becomes disrespectful or challenges their authority.\n\nThe Department of Justice also released a statement that confronted police officers\u2019 susceptibility to implicit bias: One of the things they looked was \"threat perception failure\", where an officer may believe that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case.

The US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body cameras into their departments so further investigation will be possible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|date=2015|newspaper=}}</ref>\n\n== How it is measured ==\nPolice brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases, as there is no objective method to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. In 1985, only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation: it depends on if the suspect is resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Justice Statistics|title=Use of Force|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=703|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can.

These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.\n\nUmbrella organizations and justice committees usually support those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is \"to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated\".\n\nTools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite news|title=YouTube.com prompts police beating probe |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |agency=Associated Press |last=Veiga |first=Alex |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130233223/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archivedate=November 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nCivilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct.

Early records suggest that labor strikes were the first large-scale incidents of police brutality in the United States, including events like the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919|Great Steel Strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.\n\nIn the United States, it is common for marginalized groups to perceive the police as [[oppression|oppressors]], rather than protectors or enforcers of the law, due to the statistically disproportionate number of minority incarcerations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Mary D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=56\u201360|chapter=Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>\n\nHubert Locke wrote:\n\n<blockquote>When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as \"alley court\"\u2014the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[Police station|station house]].<ref>{{cite journal|volume=44|publisher=J.

This incident led to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] commenced and resulted in 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing a federal trial, two of the four officers were convicted and received 32-month prison sentences. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011) showed that from 2003 to 2009 at least 4,813 people died while being arrested by local police. Of the deaths classified as [[law enforcement]] homicides, there were 2,876 deaths; of those, 1,643 or 57.1% of the deaths were \"people of color\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Being Arrested can be Hazardous to your Health, Especially if you are a Person of Color|url=http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/being-arrested-can-be-hazardous-your-health-especially-if-you-are-person-color}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Main|List of cases of police brutality}}\n\n===Austria===\nIn Vienna, there is an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants, which have led to African migrants being racially profiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|title=Reactions to Police Brutality|access-date=2016-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818090904/http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|archive-date=18 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere have been a number of highly publicized incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people{{emdash}}in some cases to the point of death.

Amnesty suggested that while the involvement of NGOs is valuable, more work needs to be done by the government to reduce negative social stereotypes that lead to prejudice, racial profiling, and hatred that leads to police brutality. One suggestion is to disband the ''Bereitschaftspolizei'', Vienna's riot police, as they have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality.<ref name=\":16\" /> Amnesty also suggested that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action){{emdash}}something which they have previously refused to do.<ref name=\"amnestyusa1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-austria-2013|title=Annual Report: Austria 2013|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}\nMany people have been viciously beaten by police in [[Bangladesh]].

After seeing Camilo \"attacking\" policemen with a gun in an attempt to escape, the Carabineros shot Camilo in the head and killed him. It was later discovered that this was not what happened; a partner of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he drove a tractor.

One of the first documented incidents dates back to 1976, where 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. In 1980, 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou died at the hands of the Greek police. He was beaten to death by police officers during a demonstration commemorating the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]]. The protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. The protests are still commonly affected police brutality around the time of the event.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fragkiska-megaloudi/growing-police-brutality-in-greece_b_2636529.html|title=Growing Police Brutality in Greece: The Hidden Face of the Crisis|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-22|date=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\n====Increase====\nThe level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years have been profound. Due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. Greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. It was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the police's press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection{{emdash}}Nikos Dendias{{emdash}}supported the police and claimed that they needed to use Photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/> In October 2012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party \"Golden Dawn\". Victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the Attica General Police Directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. Dendias countered by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on the Guardian report the next day were fired.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Recent instances====\nPolice brutality in Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, which took place on November 17, 2014.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/amnesty-international-condemns-greek-police-brutality|title=Amnesty International condemns Greek police brutality {{!}}thetoc.gr|date=2014-11-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}</ref> Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range \u2013 in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in the hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they laughed.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\nVideo footage confirmed that on 13 November 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/> Amnesty International called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of \"abuse and impunity\" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\nA German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. The student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/> The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.<ref name=\"thetoc.gr\"/>\n\n====Examples====\n* '''May 2011''': student Yannis Kafkas suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n* '''June 2011''': Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade at him and caused him to suffer from permanent hearing loss.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n*'''February 2012''': photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery done after being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was allegedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nThere have been instances where protesters were used as human shields \u2013 a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.co.uk\"/>\n\nNone of the cases of police brutality above resulted in any prosecution of police force members. One case that sparked nationwide riots was the death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens.

Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Protestors and non-violent civilians passing by were targeted, tackled, and injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man and raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters and paramedics.\n\n====Prevention====\nHungarian Spectrum blogger Eva S. Bologh suggest that rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to the proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force.

Given this state of events, the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections.<ref>Conway, V & Walshe, D  'Current Developments in Police Governance and Accountability in Ireland [[Crime, Law and Social Change]], Published online, 9 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\n[[Latvia]] became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, consisting of a group of volunteers to protect public order.<ref>Melnis, E, Garonskis, A & Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija''</ref> Policing during this period was quite successful and was assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1991, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were overruled by the Communist Regime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Melnis | first1 = E | last2 = Garonskis | first2 = A | last3 = Matvejevs | first3 = A | year = 2006 | title = Development of the Policing in Latvia | url = | journal = Jurisprudencija | volume = 1 | issue = 79| pages = 72\u201384 }}</ref> Due to Soviet ideals on policing that considered criminals to be the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist ideologies. During this time, an imbalance existed between police actions and citizens' rights. Despite the lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue, as illustrated by the case where the former head of police Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment in this time period for genocide against the Latvian people.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 190.</ref>\n\nIn 1991, independence of the state of Latvia was restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the ''Law on Police'' on June 5. This restructured the police into State, Security, and Local Government levels. The ''Law on Police'' reiterated ethical requirements, where police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to \"torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment\". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose among the Russian population living in Latvia; in 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality.<ref>Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 192.</ref> This hostility towards Russians remained in the following years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after Latvia's independence.\n\nIn 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies (LCHRES) found some instances of brutality and \"severe abuse\" within police authorities, especially on persons in custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm|title=Latvia|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> Reports showed high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">U.S Department of State: Diplomacy in Action, 2006, Latvia, accessed 19 July 2016 <nowiki>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm United States Department of State]</nowiki>.</ref> For the Latvian community, this meant that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.\n\nReports from Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study where it set up an anonymous hotline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/en/projects/prevention-of-torture/|title=Prevention of Torture {{!}} Latvian Centre for Human Rights|website=cilvektiesibas.org.lv|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.\n\nSince joining the European Union in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system a number of times. While the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities did not enact any of their 2007 recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/news-2013/-/asset_publisher/TEHtOeUO1Ozc/content/latvia-should-address-ill-treatment-by-police-and-improve-detention-conditions|title=Latvia should address ill-treatment by police and improve detention conditions|website=www.coe.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> Their 2011 report outlined some cases of police brutality within the prison system, with allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly while being apprehended or at the police station (including during questioning).\n\nDespite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for poor treatment is decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states \"a police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim.

The first anniversary of his death in June 2019 provided a catalyst for protests against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European background. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, which led some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest.

Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes. \n\nA recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named \"Rao Anwar\".

[[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]] writes in regards to dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|author2=Fyfe, James D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=978-1-56510-262-0|pages=45\u201355|chapter=Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality}}</ref>\n\nThere are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more inclined to use excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists surveyed officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. These include personality disorders; previous traumatic job-related experience; young, inexperienced, or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles; and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorized these groups and separated the group that was the most likely to use excessive force.<ref>Scrivner, 1994: 3\u20136</ref> However, this \"bad apple paradigm\" is considered by some to be an \"easy way out\".

This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].\n\nViolence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Police brutality is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).\n\nStudies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as \"vigilantism\", where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.<ref>Chevigny, P. (2008). \"Police Brutality\", In Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict. oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology, 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally apprehend the suspect. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force.

As a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the black society created many social organizations, such as the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement founded in 2013, which made a social impact on the world in response to the violent and systematic racism that black people still face by police officers.\n\nWhile the Justice Department reported that Cleveland police officers used \"excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists\" on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hines|first=Sandra|date=2017-09-21|chapter=Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality|publisher=Policy Press|doi=10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019|isbn=9781447327868|title=Why Detroit Matters}}</ref>\n\n==== Black Americans and the US police ====\n\nIn a report released concerning the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown shooting]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], the Justice Department admitted to the Ferguson's police department's pattern of racial bias. The department argued that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. The Justice Department explained police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers becomes disrespectful or challenges their authority.\n\nThe Department of Justice also released a statement that confronted police officers\u2019 susceptibility to implicit bias: One of the things they looked was \"threat perception failure\", where an officer may believe that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case.

The US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body cameras into their departments so further investigation will be possible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|date=2015|newspaper=}}</ref>\n\n== How it is measured ==\nPolice brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases, as there is no objective method to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. In 1985, only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation: it depends on if the suspect is resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Justice Statistics|title=Use of Force|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=703|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about the police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jefferis|first1=Eric|last2=Butcher|first2=Fredrick|last3=Hanley|first3=Dena|title=Measuring perceptions of police use of force|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2012|volume=13|issue=6|pages=81\u201396}}</ref>\n\n== Independent oversight ==\nVarious community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.\n\nUmbrella organizations and justice committees usually support those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is \"to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated\".\n\nTools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite news|title=YouTube.com prompts police beating probe |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |agency=Associated Press |last=Veiga |first=Alex |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130233223/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archivedate=November 30, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nCivilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct.

She is known for being a former member of girl groups [[3LW]] and [[The Cheetah Girls (group)|The Cheetah Girls]].\n\n==Career==\n===1999\u20132002: Career beginnings and 3LW===\nIn 1999, Williams along with [[Adrienne Bailon]] and [[Naturi Naughton]] formed the girl group [[3LW]]. The initial formation of the 3LW was pulled together by Williams' mother, who also managed the group. 3LW was signed to [[Epic Records]] and work on their debut album began in 1999. Their first single, \"[[No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)]]\", was released in the fall of 2000. \"No More\" was a chart success, and was followed by \"[[Playas Gon' Play]]\" in early 2001.\n\nThe group's [[3LW (album)|self-titled debut album]], 3LW was released on December 5, 2000. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA, selling 1.3 million copies in the US. \nIn the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the [[MTV]] ''[[Total Request Live]]'' tour along with [[Destiny's Child]], [[Dream (American group)|Dream]], [[Nelly]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], and [[Jessica Simpson]]. In 2001, 3LW recorded a song with various artists including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Usher (entertainer)]], [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Mariah Carey]] in response to the 9/11 attacks called \"[[What More Can I Give]]\". In late 2001 they collaborated with [[Romeo Miller|Lil' Romeo]] and Nick Cannon for \"[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]\" on the ''Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius'' soundtrack. Also in 2001, Williams played herself in an episode of ''[[The Jersey]]'' called \"Speaking of Coleman\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-jersey/speaking-of-coleman-220552/|title=The Jersey Season 2 Speaking of Coleman (via TV.COM)|accessdate=2018-08-21}}</ref> where after freaking out at a debate competition, Coleman Galloway (played by [[Jermaine Williams]]) gets a lesson in handling [[stage fright]] as he uses a magical jersey by jumping into her body backstage during a half-time show.\n\n3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled ''Same Game, Different Rules''. The album and its intended lead single \"Uh Oh\" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from ''Same Game, Different Rules'' were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' after their song \"Never Let Go\" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"[[I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)]]\", featuring [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]]. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on [[Nickelodeon]] titled ''Live on Sunset''. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, ''[[A Girl Can Mack]]'', when member Naughton had left the group for good after heated arguments. The album's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing debuting at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week. Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management.\n\n===2003\u20132008: ''The Cheetah Girls'', 3LW disbandment, and acting career===\nWilliams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the \"3LW\" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as \"2LW\". According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of ''Sister 2 Sister'' magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, \"Neva Get Enuf\", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Jessica, the group might have had to split due to \"bankruptcy\". Jessica's first performance was on ''[[Live with Regis & Kelly]]'', followed by a performance on ''[[Soul Train]]''. In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with [[Jermaine Dupri]]'s [[So So Def]] label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album.\n\nWhile working on the album, both Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the [[Disney Channel]] film ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]]''. They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] and [[Sabrina Bryan]] portraying the final two members. The movie was released in August 2003 and was a ratings success. The Cheetah Girls soundtrack debuted at No. 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was later certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. [[Walt Disney Records]] soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Kiely, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series ''[[That's So Raven]]''. The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled ''[[Cheetah-licious Christmas]]'', was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to [[Hollywood Records]] in 2006.\n\nThe Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel ''[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]''. Though she was absent from the main group, Raven-Symon\u00e9 did return to film the sequel. The movie premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' films. The soundtrack to the movie released on August 15, 2006, and debuted at No. 5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year. The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. \"We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack\", Bailon said. Their debut album ''[[TCG (album)|TCG]]''<ref name=tommy>[http://www.tommy2.net www.tommy2.net]. www.tommy2.net. Retrieved on 2012-06-18.</ref> was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single \"[[Fuego (The Cheetah Girls song)|Fuego]]\",<ref name=\"radiodisney_kiely\">Kiely Williams via Radio Disney Uncut Interview Podcast recorded 2007-07-10</ref> which charted on [[Hot Dance Club Play]]'s chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and ''[[MTV Tr3s]]''.\n\nThough they were heavily involved with The Cheetah Girls, Kiely and Adrienne were still members of 3LW, though progress on their fourth album had halted due to their work with The Cheetah Girls. The group's fourth studio album was originally called ''Phoenix Rising'', but was renamed ''Point of No Return''. The lead-off single, \"Feelin' You\", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Kiely's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Williams decided to then pursue The Cheetah Girls franchise full-time.\n[[File:Cheetah Girls.jpg|left|thumb|Kiely (right) performing with the Cheetah Girls on \"One World Tour\"]]\nIn 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled ''[[The Cheetah Girls: One World]]'' was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production. Like ''The Cheetah Girls 2'', it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. However, Raven-Symon\u00e9 later confirmed that she would not return for this film. The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere. In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000. Williams recorded a solo song for the film's soundtrack album entitled \"Circle Game\".\n\nIn November 2008, Williams confirmed in an interview with In Touch Weekly that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are \"open\" to working with one another again.\n\n===2009\u20132013: Continued acting and solo music ===\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, Williams began quietly working on a solo singing project separate from work in The Cheetah Girls. Following the breakup of The Cheetah Girls, she filmed the music video for her song \"Make Me a Drink\" in New York City in November 2008.\n\nIn August 2009, a preview of what was expected to be Williams debut solo single \"Make Me a Drink\" (which was written by [[Young Money Entertainment]] recording artist [[Shanell (singer)|Shanell]]) appeared on [[YouTube]], \"Make Me A Drink\"  but never officially released, and leaked to the internet in late 2018.\n\nShe completed a starring role in the independent film ''[[Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale]]''. In late 2009, Kiely began work on ''[[Stomp the Yard: Homecoming]]''. The role of Kandi Kane, in Elle, required Kiely to record several songs for the film and the accompanying soundtrack and learn extensive choreography. ''Stomp the Yard: Homecoming'' and ''Elle'' were both released in 2010.\n\nOn October 28, 2009, Williams official website released the instrumentals of her first single, titled \"Spectacular\", a song written by Williams and produced by [[Mike City]]. The single was released exclusively to club DJs the first week on November. The single was released to the public on January 15, 2010, and the accompanying music video was released to YouTube on April 5, 2010, to mostly negative reviews. The video caused so much controversy that Williams opted to respond to its negative YouTube reviews on her website as well as on ''[[Joy Behar: Say Anything!|The Joy Behar Show]]'' on [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]].\n\n===2014: Internet series ===\nKiely Williams and [[Sabrina Bryan]] co-starred on the web series \"Dinner With Friends\", \"March Moms\", and \"Bad Sex With Good People\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Ashley-Park-Signs-on-for-Web-Series-BAD-SEX-WITH-GOOD-PEOPLE-20160315|title=Ashley Park Signs on for Web Series 'Bad Sex with Good People'|first=TV News|last=Desk}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilliams married Brandon \"BJ\" Cox in December 2016, in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]].

In late 2001 they collaborated with [[Romeo Miller|Lil' Romeo]] and Nick Cannon for \"[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]\" on the ''Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius'' soundtrack. Also in 2001, Williams played herself in an episode of ''[[The Jersey]]'' called \"Speaking of Coleman\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-jersey/speaking-of-coleman-220552/|title=The Jersey Season 2 Speaking of Coleman (via TV.COM)|accessdate=2018-08-21}}</ref> where after freaking out at a debate competition, Coleman Galloway (played by [[Jermaine Williams]]) gets a lesson in handling [[stage fright]] as he uses a magical jersey by jumping into her body backstage during a half-time show.\n\n3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled ''Same Game, Different Rules''. The album and its intended lead single \"Uh Oh\" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from ''Same Game, Different Rules'' were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' after their song \"Never Let Go\" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"[[I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)]]\", featuring [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]]. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on [[Nickelodeon]] titled ''Live on Sunset''. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, ''[[A Girl Can Mack]]'', when member Naughton had left the group for good after heated arguments. The album's release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing debuting at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week. Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management.\n\n===2003\u20132008: ''The Cheetah Girls'', 3LW disbandment, and acting career===\nWilliams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the \"3LW\" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as \"2LW\". According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of ''Sister 2 Sister'' magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, \"Neva Get Enuf\", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Jessica, the group might have had to split due to \"bankruptcy\". Jessica's first performance was on ''[[Live with Regis & Kelly]]'', followed by a performance on ''[[Soul Train]]''. In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with [[Jermaine Dupri]]'s [[So So Def]] label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album.\n\nWhile working on the album, both Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the [[Disney Channel]] film ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]]''. They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] and [[Sabrina Bryan]] portraying the final two members. The movie was released in August 2003 and was a ratings success. The Cheetah Girls soundtrack debuted at No. 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was later certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. [[Walt Disney Records]] soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Kiely, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series ''[[That's So Raven]]''. The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled ''[[Cheetah-licious Christmas]]'', was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to [[Hollywood Records]] in 2006.\n\nThe Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel ''[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]''. Though she was absent from the main group, Raven-Symon\u00e9 did return to film the sequel. The movie premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' films. The soundtrack to the movie released on August 15, 2006, and debuted at No. 5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year. The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. \"We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack\", Bailon said. Their debut album ''[[TCG (album)|TCG]]''<ref name=tommy>[http://www.tommy2.net www.tommy2.net]. www.tommy2.net. Retrieved on 2012-06-18.</ref> was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single \"[[Fuego (The Cheetah Girls song)|Fuego]]\",<ref name=\"radiodisney_kiely\">Kiely Williams via Radio Disney Uncut Interview Podcast recorded 2007-07-10</ref> which charted on [[Hot Dance Club Play]]'s chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and ''[[MTV Tr3s]]''.\n\nThough they were heavily involved with The Cheetah Girls, Kiely and Adrienne were still members of 3LW, though progress on their fourth album had halted due to their work with The Cheetah Girls. The group's fourth studio album was originally called ''Phoenix Rising'', but was renamed ''Point of No Return''. The lead-off single, \"Feelin' You\", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Kiely's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in Girls Life magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Williams decided to then pursue The Cheetah Girls franchise full-time.\n[[File:Cheetah Girls.jpg|left|thumb|Kiely (right) performing with the Cheetah Girls on \"One World Tour\"]]\nIn 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled ''[[The Cheetah Girls: One World]]'' was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production. Like ''The Cheetah Girls 2'', it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. However, Raven-Symon\u00e9 later confirmed that she would not return for this film. The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere. In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000. Williams recorded a solo song for the film's soundtrack album entitled \"Circle Game\".\n\nIn November 2008, Williams confirmed in an interview with In Touch Weekly that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are \"open\" to working with one another again.\n\n===2009\u20132013: Continued acting and solo music ===\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, Williams began quietly working on a solo singing project separate from work in The Cheetah Girls. Following the breakup of The Cheetah Girls, she filmed the music video for her song \"Make Me a Drink\" in New York City in November 2008.\n\nIn August 2009, a preview of what was expected to be Williams debut solo single \"Make Me a Drink\" (which was written by [[Young Money Entertainment]] recording artist [[Shanell (singer)|Shanell]]) appeared on [[YouTube]], \"Make Me A Drink\"  but never officially released, and leaked to the internet in late 2018.\n\nShe completed a starring role in the independent film ''[[Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale]]''. In late 2009, Kiely began work on ''[[Stomp the Yard: Homecoming]]''. The role of Kandi Kane, in Elle, required Kiely to record several songs for the film and the accompanying soundtrack and learn extensive choreography. ''Stomp the Yard: Homecoming'' and ''Elle'' were both released in 2010.\n\nOn October 28, 2009, Williams official website released the instrumentals of her first single, titled \"Spectacular\", a song written by Williams and produced by [[Mike City]]. The single was released exclusively to club DJs the first week on November. The single was released to the public on January 15, 2010, and the accompanying music video was released to YouTube on April 5, 2010, to mostly negative reviews. The video caused so much controversy that Williams opted to respond to its negative YouTube reviews on her website as well as on ''[[Joy Behar: Say Anything!|The Joy Behar Show]]'' on [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]].\n\n===2014: Internet series ===\nKiely Williams and [[Sabrina Bryan]] co-starred on the web series \"Dinner With Friends\", \"March Moms\", and \"Bad Sex With Good People\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Ashley-Park-Signs-on-for-Web-Series-BAD-SEX-WITH-GOOD-PEOPLE-20160315|title=Ashley Park Signs on for Web Series 'Bad Sex with Good People'|first=TV News|last=Desk}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWilliams married Brandon \"BJ\" Cox in December 2016, in [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]]. [[Sabrina Bryan]] served as a bridesmaid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://on.mtv.com/2hMAE9M|title=Kiely Williams Got Married With A Fellow Cheetah Girl As Her Maid of Honor}}</ref> The couple announced they were expecting their first child in October 2017.<ref>https://www.essence.com/celebrity/3lw-kiely-williams-expecting-baby-girl/</ref> Their child, a daughter name Rowan, arrived in March 2018.<ref>https://people.com/parents/sabrina-bryan-kiely-williams-sing-cheetah-girls-lullaby-baby-video/</ref>\n\n==Discography==\nSee also: [[3LW discography]] and [[The Cheetah Girls discography]]\n\nSolo Discography:\n\n2008: Circle Game\n\n2009: Make Me a Drink (Snippet)\n\n2010: Spectacular\n\n2018: Make Me a Drink (Full)\n\n==Filmography==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Television roles\n!

Infection may be limited to the cavity and wall of her [[uterus]], or it may spread beyond to cause [[septicaemia]] (blood poisoning) or other illnesses, especially when her resistance has been lowered by a long labour or severe bleeding. Puerperal infection is most common on the raw surface of the interior of the uterus after separation of the [[placenta]] (afterbirth); but [[pathogenic]] organisms may also affect [[lacerations]] of any part of the genital tract. By whatever portal, they can invade the [[bloodstream]] and [[lymph system]] to cause [[sepsis]], [[cellulitis]] (inflammation of connective tissue), and pelvic or generalized [[peritonitis]] (inflammation of the abdominal lining). The severity of the illness depends on the [[virulence]] of the infecting organism, the resistance of the invaded tissues, and the general health of the woman. Organisms commonly producing this infection are ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''; [[staphylococci]] (inhabitants of the skin and of [[pimples]], [[carbuncles]], and many other [[pustular]] eruptions); the [[Peptostreptococcus|anaerobic streptococci]], which flourish in devitalized tissues such as may be present after long and injurious labour and unskilled instrumental delivery; ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (inhabitants of the lower bowel); and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.\n\n===Risk factors===\nCauses (listed in order of decreasing frequency) include [[endometritis]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[pneumonia]]/[[atelectasis]], [[wound infection]], and [[septic pelvic thrombophlebitis]]. Septic risk factors for each condition are listed in order of the [[postpartum]] day (PPD) on which the condition generally occurs.\n* PPD 0: [[atelectasis]] risk factors include [[general anesthesia]], [[cigarette smoking]], and [[obstructive lung disease]].\n* PPD 1\u20132: urinary tract infections risk factors include multiple [[catheterization]] during labor, multiple [[vaginal examination]]s during labor, and untreated [[bacteriuria]].\n* PPD 2\u20133: endometritis ( the most common cause ) risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examinations during labor.\n* PPD 4\u20135: wound infection risk factors include emergency [[cesarean section]], prolonged [[membrane rupture]], prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examination during labor.\n* PPD 5\u20136: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and diffuse difficult vaginal childbirth.\n* PPD 7\u201321: [[mastitis]] risk factors include nipple trauma from [[breastfeeding]].\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nPuerperal fever is diagnosed when:\n* A temperature rise above {{convert|38|C|F|1|abbr=on}} maintained over 24 hours or recurring during the period from the end of the first to the end of the 10th day after childbirth or abortion. (ICD-10)\n* Oral temperature of {{convert|38|C|F|1|abbr=on}} or more on any two of the first ten days postpartum.

Rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy, is shown for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784-1849|view rates]]). His efforts were futile, however.]]\nFrom the 1600s through the mid-to-late 1800s, the majority of childbed fever cases were caused by the doctors themselves. With no knowledge of [[Microorganism|germs]], doctors did not believe hand washing was needed.\n\nHospitals for childbirth became common in the 17th century in many European cities. These \"lying-in\" hospitals were established at a time when there was no knowledge of [[antisepsis]] or [[epidemiology]], and women were subjected to crowding, frequent vaginal examinations, and the use of contaminated instruments, dressings, and bedding. It was common for a doctor to deliver one baby after another, without washing his hands or changing clothes between patients.\n\nThe first recorded epidemic of puerperal fever occurred at the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris]] in 1646. Hospitals throughout Europe and America consistently reported death rates between 20% to 25% of all women giving birth, punctuated by intermittent epidemics with up to 100% fatalities of women giving birth in childbirth wards.<ref>Loudon I.

Semmelweis also noticed that puerperal fever was rare in women who gave birth before arriving at the hospital. Semmelweis noted that doctors in First Division performed autopsies each morning on women who had died the previous day, but the midwives were not required or allowed to perform such autopsies. He made the connection between the autopsies and puerperal fever after a colleague, [[Jakob Kolletschka]], died of sepsis after accidentally cutting his hand while performing an autopsy.\n\nSemmelweis began experimenting with various cleansing agents and, from May 1847, ordered all doctors and students working in the First Division wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before starting ward work, and later before each vaginal examination.

Infection may be limited to the cavity and wall of her [[uterus]], or it may spread beyond to cause [[septicaemia]] (blood poisoning) or other illnesses, especially when her resistance has been lowered by a long labour or severe bleeding. Puerperal infection is most common on the raw surface of the interior of the uterus after separation of the [[placenta]] (afterbirth); but [[pathogenic]] organisms may also affect [[lacerations]] of any part of the genital tract. By whatever portal, they can invade the [[bloodstream]] and [[lymph system]] to cause [[sepsis]], [[cellulitis]] (inflammation of connective tissue), and pelvic or generalized [[peritonitis]] (inflammation of the abdominal lining). The severity of the illness depends on the [[virulence]] of the infecting organism, the resistance of the invaded tissues, and the general health of the woman. Organisms commonly producing this infection are ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''; [[staphylococci]] (inhabitants of the skin and of [[pimples]], [[carbuncles]], and many other [[pustular]] eruptions); the [[Peptostreptococcus|anaerobic streptococci]], which flourish in devitalized tissues such as may be present after long and injurious labour and unskilled instrumental delivery; ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (inhabitants of the lower bowel); and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.\n\n===Risk factors===\nCauses (listed in order of decreasing frequency) include [[endometritis]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[pneumonia]]/[[atelectasis]], [[wound infection]], and [[septic pelvic thrombophlebitis]].

With no knowledge of [[Microorganism|germs]], doctors did not believe hand washing was needed.\n\nHospitals for childbirth became common in the 17th century in many European cities. These \"lying-in\" hospitals were established at a time when there was no knowledge of [[antisepsis]] or [[epidemiology]], and women were subjected to crowding, frequent vaginal examinations, and the use of contaminated instruments, dressings, and bedding. It was common for a doctor to deliver one baby after another, without washing his hands or changing clothes in between.\n\nThe first recorded epidemic of puerperal fever occurred at the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris]] in 1646. Hospitals throughout Europe and America consistently reported death rates between 20% to 25% of all women giving birth, punctuated by intermittent epidemics with up to 100% fatalities of women giving birth in childbirth wards.<ref>Loudon I.

These numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of ''The Downward Spiral''. Promotional-only releases do not have their own numbers, although the promotional singles for \"Piggy\" and \"Hurt\" were both labeled as \"Halo Ten\", a title later officially used for ''Further Down the Spiral''. A US promo for \"Into the Void\" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the ''Things Falling Apart'' remix album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n;''Pretty Hate Machine'' era (1989\u20131990)\n{{Further|Halo I\u2013IV}}\n* Halo 1: \"[[Down in It]]\" (1989)\n* Halo 2: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989)\n** Halo 2R: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine#Reissue|Pretty Hate Machine: Remastered]]''  (2010)\n* Halo 3: \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\" (1990)\n* Halo 4: \"[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]\" (1990)\n\n;''Broken'' era (1992)\n* Halo 5: ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''\n* Halo 6: ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]''\n\n;''The Downward Spiral'' era (1994\u20131997)\n* Halo 7: \"[[March of the Pigs]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 8: ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994)\n** Halo 8 DE: ''The Downward Spiral: Deluxe Edition'', reissue (2004)\n** Halo 8 DVD-A: ''The Downward Spiral: [[DualDisc]]'', reissue (2004)\n* Halo 9: \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 10: ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' (1995)\n** Halo 10 v2: ''Further Down the Spiral'', European/Australian/Japanese release\n* Halo 11: \"[[The Perfect Drug]]\" (1997)\n* Halo 12: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997)\n\n;''The Fragile'' era (1999\u20132002)\n* Halo 13: \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\" (1999)\n* Halo 14: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]'' (1999)\n** Halo 30: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)#The Fragile: Deviations 1|The Fragile: Deviations 1]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 15: \"[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 a: \"[[We're in This Together|We're in This Together CD1]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 b: \"We're in This Together CD2\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 c: \"We're in This Together CD3\" (1999)\n* Halo 16: ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' (2000)\n* Halo 17: ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2002), limited edition packaged with Halo 17b\n** Halo 17a: ''And All That Could Have Been'', live CD\n** Halo 17b: ''Still'', limited edition bonus CD\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n;''With Teeth'' era (2005\u20132007)\n* Halo 18: \"[[The Hand That Feeds]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 19: ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005)\n** Halo 19 DVD-A: ''With Teeth'', DualDisc release\n* Halo 20: \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 21: \"[[Every Day Is Exactly the Same]]\" (2006)\n* Halo 22: ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007)\n** Halo 22 HD: ''Beside You in Time'', Live Blu-ray\n\n;''Year Zero'' era (2007)\n* Halo 23: \"[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]\" \n* Halo 24: ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]''\n* Halo 25: ''[[Year Zero Remixed]]''\n\n;''Ghosts I\u2013IV'' era (2008)\n* Halo 26: ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'', digital download\n** Halo 26 CD: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 2\u00d7 CD\n** Halo 26 V: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 4\u00d7 vinyl\n** Halo 26 DE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Deluxe Edition\n** Halo 26 LE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition\n\n;''The Slip'' era (2008)\n* Halo 27: ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]''\n** Halo 27 CD-LE: ''The Slip'', Limited Edition CD with bonus DVD\n\n;''Hesitation Marks'' era (2013)\n* Halo 28: ''[[Hesitation Marks]]''\n** Halo 28dcd: ''Hesitation Marks'', Deluxe Edition\n\n;The Trilogy era (2016\u20132018)\n* Halo 29: ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 31: ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017)\n* Halo 32: ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018)\n\n;''Ghosts V\u2013VI'' era (2020)\n* Halo 33: ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' (2020)\n* Halo 34: ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]]'' (2020)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n<!--This section is for ORIGINAL Nine Inch Nails material created specifically for movies or other media.

These numbers are sometimes modified for alternate versions of a release, such as the multiple releases of ''The Downward Spiral''. Promotional-only releases do not have their own numbers, although the promotional singles for \"Piggy\" and \"Hurt\" were both labeled as \"Halo Ten\", a title later officially used for ''Further Down the Spiral''. A US promo for \"Into the Void\" is mislabeled as Halo 16 because this number actually belongs to the ''Things Falling Apart'' remix album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n;''Pretty Hate Machine'' era (1989\u20131990)\n{{Further|Halo I\u2013IV}}\n* Halo 1: \"[[Down in It]]\" (1989)\n* Halo 2: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989)\n** Halo 2R: ''[[Pretty Hate Machine#Reissue|Pretty Hate Machine: Remastered]]''  (2010)\n* Halo 3: \"[[Head Like a Hole]]\" (1990)\n* Halo 4: \"[[Sin (Nine Inch Nails song)|Sin]]\" (1990)\n\n;''Broken'' era (1992)\n* Halo 5: ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]''\n* Halo 6: ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]''\n\n;''The Downward Spiral'' era (1994\u20131997)\n* Halo 7: \"[[March of the Pigs]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 8: ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994)\n** Halo 8 DE: ''The Downward Spiral: Deluxe Edition'', reissue (2004)\n** Halo 8 DVD-A: ''The Downward Spiral: [[DualDisc]]'', reissue (2004)\n* Halo 9: \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\" (1994)\n* Halo 10: ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' (1995)\n** Halo 10 v2: ''Further Down the Spiral'', European/Australian/Japanese release\n* Halo 11: \"[[The Perfect Drug]]\" (1997)\n* Halo 12: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997)\n\n;''The Fragile'' era (1999\u20132002)\n* Halo 13: \"[[The Day the World Went Away]]\" (1999)\n* Halo 14: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]'' (1999)\n** Halo 30: ''[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)#The Fragile: Deviations 1|The Fragile: Deviations 1]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 15: \"[[Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)|Into the Void]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 a: \"[[We're in This Together|We're in This Together CD1]]\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 b: \"We're in This Together CD2\" (1999)\n** Halo 15 c: \"We're in This Together CD3\" (1999)\n* Halo 16: ''[[Things Falling Apart]]'' (2000)\n* Halo 17: ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2002), limited edition packaged with Halo 17b\n** Halo 17a: ''And All That Could Have Been'', live CD\n** Halo 17b: ''Still'', limited edition bonus CD\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n;''With Teeth'' era (2005\u20132007)\n* Halo 18: \"[[The Hand That Feeds]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 19: ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005)\n** Halo 19 DVD-A: ''With Teeth'', DualDisc release\n* Halo 20: \"[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]\" (2005)\n* Halo 21: \"[[Every Day Is Exactly the Same]]\" (2006)\n* Halo 22: ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007)\n** Halo 22 HD: ''Beside You in Time'', Live Blu-ray\n\n;''Year Zero'' era (2007)\n* Halo 23: \"[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]\" \n* Halo 24: ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]''\n* Halo 25: ''[[Year Zero Remixed]]''\n\n;''Ghosts I\u2013IV'' era (2008)\n* Halo 26: ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'', digital download\n** Halo 26 CD: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 2\u00d7 CD\n** Halo 26 V: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', 4\u00d7 vinyl\n** Halo 26 DE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Deluxe Edition\n** Halo 26 LE: ''Ghosts I\u2013IV'', Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition\n\n;''The Slip'' era (2008)\n* Halo 27: ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]''\n** Halo 27 CD-LE: ''The Slip'', Limited Edition CD with bonus DVD\n\n;''Hesitation Marks'' era (2013)\n* Halo 28: ''[[Hesitation Marks]]''\n** Halo 28dcd: ''Hesitation Marks'', Deluxe Edition\n\n;The Trilogy era (2016\u20132018)\n* Halo 29: ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016)\n* Halo 31: ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017)\n* Halo 32: ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018)\n\n;''Ghosts V\u2013VI'' era (2020)\n* Halo 33: ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' (2020)\n* Halo 34: ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]]'' (2020)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Other appearances==\n<!--This section is for ORIGINAL Nine Inch Nails material created specifically for movies or other media.
