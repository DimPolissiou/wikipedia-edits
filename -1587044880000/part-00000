The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible [[civil liberties]] and ethical implications of using such technology.\n\n==Plot Summary==\nWhen the United States [[National Security Agency]]'s code-breaking [[supercomputer]] TRANSLTR encounters a revolutionary new code, ''Digital Fortress,'' that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in head cryptographer Susan Fletcher to crack it. She is informed by Strathmore that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's intrusion into people's private lives. If the NSA doesn't reveal TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, \"North Dakota\", release it for free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. Strathmore tells Susan that Tankado has in fact died in [[Seville]], of what appears to be a heart attack. Strathmore intends to keep the death a secret because if Tankado's partner finds out, he will upload the code. The agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.\n\nStrathmore asks Susan's fianc\u00e9 David Becker to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Ceelo Green gave the ring away just before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious deaf assassin.\n\nMeanwhile, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka (chairman of the Japanese computer company Numatech) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). And to save the TRANSLTR  he decides to shut it down but is murdered after being pushed off the catwalk in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.\n\nHale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains that the e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was actually in his inbox because he was snooping on Strathmore, who was also watching Tankado's e-mail account. After the encounter, Hale's name is cleared when Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are actually the same person, as \"NDAKOTA\" is an anagram of \"Tankado.\" Then she realises that the thing that has been run by TRANSLTR for hours is actually a virus as it is impossible to write an unbreakable code and the only other thing that could be run by TRANSLTR for hours is a virus.\n\nStrathmore exposes himself when he fatally shoots Hale and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Susan later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker later kills Hulohot in a violent confrontation.\n\nChapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA could spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would \"eat away\" at the NSA databank's security and allow \"any third-grader with a modem\" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.\n\n===Characters===\n*'''Susan Fletcher''' \u2013 The NSA's Head Cryptographer, and the story's lead character\n*'''David Becker''' \u2013 A Professor of Modern Languages and the fianc\u00e9 of Susan Fletcher\n*'''Ensei Tankado''' \u2013 The author of ''Digital Fortress'' and a disgruntled former NSA employee.\n*'''Commander Trevor Strathmore''' \u2013 NSA Deputy Director of Operations\n*'''Phil Chartrukian''' \u2013 Sys-Sec Technician\n*'''Greg Hale''' \u2013 NSA Cryptographer\n*'''Leland Fontaine''' \u2013 Director of NSA\n*'''Hulohot''' \u2013 an assassin hired by Strathmore to locate the Passkey\n*'''Midge Milken''' \u2013 Fontaine's internal security analyst\n*'''Chad Brinkerhoff''' \u2013 Fontaine's personal assistant\n*'''\"Jabba\"''' \u2013 NSA's senior System Security Officer\n*'''Soshi Kuta''' \u2013 Jabba's head technician and assistant\n*'''Tokugen Numataka''' \u2013 Japanese Executive attempting to purchase ''Digital Fortress''\n*'''Peter McCuffin''' \u2013 Worker at the NSA, Part of the Crypto Team\n\n==Inaccuracies and criticism==\nThe book was criticized by ''GCN'' for portraying facts about the NSA incorrectly and for misunderstanding the technology in the book, especially for the time when it was published.<ref>{{cite news |last=Breen II |first=John |title=Why can't novels get technology right? |work=GCN |publisher=Public Sector Media Group |location=United States |date=2011-08-02 |url= https://gcn.com/articles/2011/08/02/why-dont-authors-get-technology-right.aspx |accessdate=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the town hall of the Spanish city of Seville invited Dan Brown to visit the city, in order to dispel the inaccuracies about Seville that Brown represented within the book.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nash |first=Elizabeth |title=Dan Brown: Seville smells and is corrupt.

However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would \"eat away\" at the NSA databank's security and allow \"any third-grader with a modem\" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.\n\n===Characters===\n*'''Susan Fletcher''' \u2013 The NSA's Head Cryptographer, and the story's lead character\n*'''David Becker''' \u2013 A Professor of Modern Languages and the fianc\u00e9 of Susan Fletcher\n*'''Ensei Tankado''' \u2013 The author of ''Digital Fortress'' and a disgruntled former NSA employee.\n*'''Commander Trevor Strathmore''' \u2013 NSA Deputy Director of Operations\n*'''Phil Chartrukian''' \u2013 Sys-Sec Technician\n*'''Greg Hale''' \u2013 NSA Cryptographer\n*'''Leland Fontaine''' \u2013 Director of NSA\n*'''Hulohot''' \u2013 an assassin hired by Strathmore to locate the Passkey\n*'''Midge Milken''' \u2013 Fontaine's internal security analyst\n*'''Chad Brinkerhoff''' \u2013 Fontaine's personal assistant\n*'''\"Jabba\"''' \u2013 NSA's senior System Security Officer\n*'''Soshi Kuta''' \u2013 Jabba's head technician and assistant\n*'''Tokugen Numataka''' \u2013 Japanese Executive attempting to purchase ''Digital Fortress''\n*'''Peter McCuffin''' \u2013 Worker at the NSA, Part of the Crypto Team\n\n==Inaccuracies and criticism==\nThe book was criticized by ''GCN'' for portraying facts about the NSA incorrectly and for misunderstanding the technology in the book, especially for the time when it was published.<ref>{{cite news |last=Breen II |first=John |title=Why can't novels get technology right? |work=GCN |publisher=Public Sector Media Group |location=United States |date=2011-08-02 |url= https://gcn.com/articles/2011/08/02/why-dont-authors-get-technology-right.aspx |accessdate=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the town hall of the Spanish city of Seville invited Dan Brown to visit the city, in order to dispel the inaccuracies about Seville that Brown represented within the book.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nash |first=Elizabeth |title=Dan Brown: Seville smells and is corrupt.

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]]) in the United States.\n\nThe use of digital sampling and [[Loop (music)|looping]] in popular music was pioneered by Japanese [[electronic music]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO).<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo city guide|author=Mayumi Yoshida Barakan & Judith Connor Greer|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0-8048-1964-5|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJbd43uxLiMC&pg=PA144|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref><ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\">{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You\u2019re Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"condry_59\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> Their approach to sampling was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology.<ref name=\"condry_59\">{{cite book|last=Condry|first=Ian|title=Hip-hop Japan: rap and the paths of cultural globalization|year=2006|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=0-8223-3892-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37QWE3yRY-4C&pg=PA59|page=60}}</ref> \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game/Firecracker]]\" (1978) interpolated a [[Martin Denny]] melody,<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica&nbsp;\u2013 and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=4 July 2008|location=London}}</ref> and sampled ''[[Space Invaders]]''<ref name=\"wire_2002\">{{citation|title=The Wire, Issues 221\u2013226|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|year=2002|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyFMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> [[Video game music|video game sounds]].<ref name=\"guardian_ymo\"/> ''[[Technodelic]]'' (1981) introduced the use of digital sampling in popular music, as the first album consisting of mostly samples and [[Loop (music)|loops]].<ref name=\"thevinyldistrict\"/><ref name=\"rockin\"/> The album was produced using [[Toshiba-EMI]]'s LMD-649 digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], which engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO.<ref name=\"rockin\">''[[:nl:Rockin'f|Rockin'f]]'', March 1982, [http://tokyosky.sub.jp/tokyosky_webmasters_blog/2011/02/f-19823-lmd-649-1982.html pages 140\u2013141]{{Better source|date=April 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The LMD-649 was also used for sampling by other Japanese [[synthpop]] artists in the early 1980s, including YMO-associated acts such as [[:ja:\u771f\u934b\u3061\u3048\u307f|Chiemi Manabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Chiemi-Manabe-%E4%B8%8D%E6%80%9D%E8%AD%B0%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-/release/4389700|title=Chiemi Manabe \u2013 \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u30fb\u5c11\u5973|website=Discogs}}</ref> and [[Hideki Matsutake|Logic System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Logic-System-Orient-Express/release/703523|title=Logic System \u2013 Orient Express|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 1980s===\n{{See also|New school hip hop|Miami bass|Freestyle music|Hip house|Latin house|Industrial dance music}}\n\nThe emergence of electronic dance music in the 1980s was shaped by the development of several new [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly those from the Japanese [[Roland Corporation]].

This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s.

These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

The report also identified several emerging markets for electronic dance music, including [[East Asia]], [[India]], and [[South Africa]], credited primarily to investment by domestic, as well as American and European interests.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol. In the genre's early days, hardware electronic musical instruments were used and the focus in production was mainly on manipulating MIDI data as opposed to manipulating audio signals. Since the late 1990s the use of [[software]] has increased. A modern electronic music production studio generally consists of a computer running a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW), with various [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] installed such as software synthesizers and effects units, which are controlled with a MIDI controller such as a [[MIDI keyboard]].

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415923736|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> Another drug [[para-Methoxyamphetamine]] (4-MA) also known as pink ecstasy, PMA, \"Death\" or \"Dr. Death\", it is similar to MDMA but they can take up to an hour to produce effects, which can result in hyperthermia and subsequently, organ failure.

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the \"[[Krautrock]]\" of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.\n\nEarly synth-pop pioneers included Japanese group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and British bands [[Ultravox]], [[the Human League]] and [[Berlin Blondes]]{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; proof needed that they are regarded as pioneers.|date=May 2018}}. [[The Human League]] used [[monophonic synthesizer]]s to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], and newcomers such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Eurythmics]]. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synth-pop bands such as [[P-Model]], [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]], and [[Hikashu]]. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop.

Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, [[Tech trance]] is a mixture of trance and techno, and [[Vocal trance]] \"combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music\".<ref name=\"tranceexperience\" /> The [[dream trance]] genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by [[Robert Miles]].\n\n[[AllMusic]] states on progressive trance: \"the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound, since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place.

This music, much like [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] before it, combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats or break beats, other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. Relative to earlier styles of dance music such as house and techno, so called 'rave music' tended to emphasise bass sounds and use faster tempos, or [[Tempo|beats per minute]] (BPM). This subgenre was known as \"hardcore\" rave, but from as early as 1991, some musical tracks made up of these high-tempo break beats, with heavy basslines and samples of older Jamaican music, were referred to as \"jungle [[techno]]\", a genre influenced by [[Jack Smooth]] and Basement Records, and later just \"jungle\", which became recognized as a separate musical genre popular at raves and on [[pirate radio]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is important to note when discussing the history of drum & bass that prior to jungle, rave music was getting faster and more experimental.\n\nBy 1994, jungle had begun to gain mainstream popularity and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the ecstasy-fuelled rave scene, Jungle also inherited some associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dance hall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dance music in the 21st century===\n{{See also|Bass music|Crunk|Trap music|Trap music (EDM)|Footwork (genre)|Electroclash|Moombahton|Microgenres}}\n\n====Dubstep====\n{{Main|Dubstep}}\nDubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in [[South London]] in the late 1990s. It is generally characterized by sparse, [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]] with [[bass line]]s that contain prominent [[sub-bass]] frequencies.

These tracks were darker, more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals, and attempted to incorporate elements of [[breakbeat]] and [[drum and bass]] into 2-step. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition, and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].<ref>IMO Records [http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ \"Hatcha Biography\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122021/http://www.imorecords.co.uk/dubstep/hatcha-biography/ |date=12 January 2012 }}, ''[[IMO Records]]'', London, 17 October 2011.

Former Universal Music executive Eric Zho, inspired by the US growth, made the first significant investments in electronic music in China, including the organisation of [[Shanghai]]'s inaugural Storm festival in 2013, the reaching of a [[title sponsor]]ship deal for the festival with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser brand, a local talent search, and organising collaborations between EDM producers and Chinese singers, such as [[Avicii]] and [[Wang Leehom]]'s \"Lose Myself\". In the years following, a larger number of EDM events began to appear in China, and Storm itself was also preceded by a larger number of pre-parties in 2014 than its inaugural year. A new report released during the inaugural International Music Summit China in October 2015 revealed that the Chinese EDM industry was experiencing modest gains, citing the larger number of events (including new major festival brands such as Modern Sky and YinYang), a 6% increase in the sales of electronic music in the country, and the significant size of the overall market. Zho also believed that the country's \"hands-on\" political climate, as well as investments by China into cultural events, helped in \"encouraging\" the growth of EDM in the country.<ref name=wsj-china>{{cite news|author1=Hannah Karp|title=In China, Concert Promoter Wants EDM in the Mix|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-china-concert-promoter-wants-edm-in-the-mix-1412351903 |work = Wall Street Journal|date=October 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=thump-chinapopoff>{{cite web|title=Is the EDM Scene in China about to Pop Off?|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/is-the-edm-scene-in-china-about-to-pop-off|website=Thump|publisher=Vice Media|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was used in the United States as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term <sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-99|[95]]].</sup> Writing in ''The Guardian'', journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-Definition-4|[4]]]</sup>What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-genres-100|[96]]]</sup> Until the late 1990s, when the larger US music industry created music charts for \"dance\" (''Billboard'' magazine has maintained a \"dance\" chart since 1974 and it continues to this day).<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-atlantic-96|[93]]]</sup> In July 1995, [[Nervous Records]] and ''Project X Magazine'' hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".<sup>[[Electronic dance music#cite note-98|[Note 4]]]</sup>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Friend's home studio (by David J).jpg|thumb|right|A typical [[home studio]] setup for EDM production with computer, audio interface and various MIDI instruments.]]\n\nElectronic dance music is generally composed and produced in a [[recording studio]] with specialized equipment such as [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[effects unit]]s and [[MIDI controller]]s all set up to interact with one another using the [[MIDI]] protocol.

This combination is probably the main reason why it is generally seen an increase in toxicity events at rave parties since all these factors are thought to induce or enhance the toxicity (particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.&nbsp;... Another report showed that MDMA users displayed multiple regions of grey matter reduction in the neocortical, bilateral cerebellum, and midline brainstem brain regions, potentially accounting for previously reported neuropsychiatric impairments in MDMA users (Cowan et al. 2003). Neuroimaging techniques, like PET, were used in combination with a 5-HTT ligand in human ''ecstasy'' users, showing lower density of brain 5-HTT sites (McCann et al. 1998, 2005, 2008). Other authors correlate the 5-HTT reductions with the memory deficits seen in humans with a history of recreational MDMA use (McCann et al. 2008). A recent study prospectively assessed the sustained effects of ''ecstasy'' use on the brain in novel MDMA users using repeated measurements with a combination of different neuroimaging parameters of neurotoxicity. The authors concluded that low MDMA dosages can produce sustained effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation, and possibly axonal damage (de Win et al. 2008).}}</ref> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic amphetamine quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeals to users in the \"rave\" setting.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II, while Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been developed for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Hawker Siddeley]]''' (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the \"Violet Banner\" PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been developed for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBlue Vesta", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}
