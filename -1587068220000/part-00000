He played [[college football]] at [[Arizona State University]] and was drafted by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the second round of the [[2012 NFL Draft]].\n\nDuring his fourth year with the Broncos, Osweiler was a member of the team that won [[Super Bowl 50]] over the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. That season marked his first appearance as a starter when he relieved an injured [[Peyton Manning]], to whom he had served as a backup in his first three years, although Manning would resume his starting duties during the postseason. After the Broncos' title victory, Osweiler signed a four-year, $72 million deal with the [[Houston Texans]], but he struggled with the team and threw a franchise-record 16 interceptions. He was traded to the [[Cleveland Browns]] but was subsequently released before the 2017 season and re-signed with the Broncos, with whom he then started five games. Osweiler then played 2018 with the [[Miami Dolphins]], appearing in seven games.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Kalispell,Montana]] on November 22, 1990, Osweiler was raised by his parents, Kathy and John Osweiler, in [[Kalispell, Montana]].

He played [[college football]] at [[Arizona State University]] and was drafted by the [[Denver Broncos]] in the second round of the [[2012 NFL Draft]].\n\nDuring his fourth year with the Broncos, Osweiler was a member of the team that won [[Super Bowl 50]] over the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. That season marked his first appearance as a starter when he relieved an injured [[Peyton Manning]], to whom he had served as a backup in his first three years, although Manning would resume his starting duties during the postseason. After the Broncos' title victory, Osweiler signed a four-year, $72 million deal with the [[Houston Texans]], but he struggled with the team and threw a franchise-record 16 interceptions. He was traded to the [[Cleveland Browns]] but was subsequently released before the 2017 season and re-signed with the Broncos, with whom he then started five games. Osweiler then played 2018 with the [[Miami Dolphins]], appearing in seven games.\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] on November 22, 1990, Osweiler was raised by his parents, Kathy and John Osweiler, in [[Kalispell, Montana]].

To protect the rights of the copyright holders, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] requires Course Hero to expeditiously remove content when it is flagged as infringing its copyright.

He acquired a home in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and made himself an important player on [[Wall Street]], where his success eclipsed even that of the renowned stock speculator [[Jesse Livermore]], with whom he often battled as a bull vs. the often bearish short seller Livermore.  In the crash of 1929, Livermore's fortune reached new heights, while Cutten's dwindled (but Livermore died broke several years later). In 1925, farm prices began a steady fall, from which they would not permanently recover for more than 15 years.  Nevertheless, at the time Arthur Cutten remained optimistic about the American economy and was featured in a cover story of the December 10, 1928 issue of [[Time magazine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19281210,00.html |title=Time magazine |date=10 December 1928 |publisher=Time-Life, Inc. |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> in a profile as one of the leading market \"[[bull market|Bulls]]\" of the Big Bull Market of the 1920s.  However, less than a year later Cutten had lost more than $50 million as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929.  The ensuing investigation of the crash by the [[United States Senate|United States Senate's]] [[Pecora Commission]] brought a public outcry over rich speculators such as Cutten who had made huge amounts of money by forming trading pools to manipulate market prices.  New legislation was introduced to end [[market manipulation]], and the U.S. government targeted certain of the high-profile speculators.[[File:Guelph Cutten Obelisk Base.jpg|thumb|left|The base of Cutten's monument]]\n\n[[Henry A. Wallace]], the then [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] charged Cutten with improper trading activities and tried to have him barred from trading on all [[futures exchange]]s in the United States. This ultimately went to the US Supreme Court in the case of [[Wallace v. Cutten]], 298 U.S. 229 (1936)\n\nThe government then went after him for [[income tax]] evasion. The tax suit would only be settled by the executors of his estate, because Arthur Cutten, his fortune vastly depleted by the stock market crash and the cost of [[lawyer]]s to defend him from the government lawsuits, died in Chicago of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] a few weeks short of his sixty-sixth birthday.  His body was brought back to his Canadian birthplace and interred in the family plot in Guelph's Woodlawn Cemetery.<ref>{{cite news|last1=CP|title=Simple Service Held For Arthur Cutten: Men Prominent From All Walks of Life Attend His Funeral|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=27 June 1936|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[http://www.wampumkeeper.com/cutten.html \"Guelph's Wheat King: Arthur Cutten,]\" by Pat Montague, originally published in ''The Wellington Business Digest'', Vol. 1, Issue 5, April 1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''The story of a speculator'', by Arthur W.

In the crash of 1929, Livermore's fortune reached new heights, while Cutten's dwindled (but Livermore died broke several years later). In 1925, farm prices began a steady fall, from which they would not permanently recover for more than 15 years.  Nevertheless, at the time Arthur Cutten remained optimistic about the American economy and was featured in a cover story of the December 10, 1928 issue of [[Time magazine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19281210,00.html |title=Time magazine |date=10 December 1928 |publisher=Time-Life, Inc. |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> in a profile as one of the leading market \"[[bull market|Bulls]]\" of the Big Bull Market of the 1920s.  However, less than a year later Cutten had lost more than $50 million as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929.  The ensuing investigation of the crash by the [[United States Senate|United States Senate's]] [[Pecora Commission]] brought a public outcry over rich speculators such as Cutten who had made huge amounts of money by forming trading pools to manipulate market prices.  New legislation was introduced to end [[market manipulation]], and the U.S. government targeted certain of the high-profile speculators.[[File:Guelph Cutten Obelisk Base.jpg|thumb|left|The base of Cutten's monument]]\n\n[[Henry A. Wallace]], the then [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] charged Cutten with improper trading activities and tried to have him barred from trading on all [[futures exchange]]s in the United States. This ultimately went to the US Supreme Court in the case of [[Wallace v. Cutten]], 298 U.S. 229 (1936)\n\nThe government then went after him for [[income tax]] evasion. The tax suit would only be settled by the executors of his estate, because Arthur Cutten, his fortune vastly depleted by the stock market crash and the cost of [[lawyer]]s to defend him from the government lawsuits, died in Chicago of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] a few weeks short of his sixty-sixth birthday.  His body was brought back to his Canadian birthplace and interred in the family plot in Guelph's Woodlawn Cemetery.<ref>{{cite news|last1=CP|title=Simple Service Held For Arthur Cutten: Men Prominent From All Walks of Life Attend His Funeral|publisher=Globe and Mail|date=27 June 1936|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[http://www.wampumkeeper.com/cutten.html \"Guelph's Wheat King: Arthur Cutten,]\" by Pat Montague, originally published in ''The Wellington Business Digest'', Vol. 1, Issue 5, April 1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''The story of a speculator'', by Arthur W.
