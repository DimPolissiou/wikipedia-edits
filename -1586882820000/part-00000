ACC is supported by the SB710 and the SB750 southbridges, and available through BIOS settings on some motherboards and AMD OverDrive utility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/2573/2 |title=AMD's SB750: Enabling Higher Phenom Overclocks? |publisher=AnandTech |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>\n\nIt was later discovered that this functionality has the possibility of unlocking the supposedly disabled cores of some Phenom II X2/X3 processors.

While NVIDIA also has a similar technology for its [[nForce 700#nForce 780a|nForce 780a]] motherboards, called NVCC (NVIDIA Clock Calibration) with very similar functionality.\n\n===Energy efficiency===\nOne of the major focus of the chipset series is the energy efficiency of the chipsets. The need for energy-efficient chipsets have risen since chipsets starts including more features and more [[PCI Express]] lanes, to provide better system scalability by using PCI-E add-on cards.\n\nBut one issue is that chipset circuitries were usually made on a larger fabrication process nodes compared with the latest CPU process node, making recent chipsets consume more and more power than their predecessors.

Although the aforementioned figures may be small compared to the TDP figures of a performance CPU, there is a growing demand for computer systems with higher performance and lower power consumption. While Intel focuses only on the energy efficiency of its processors, NVIDIA's [[nForce 700#nForce 7xx|nForce 780i]] chipset requires an overall power consumption of 48 W with the northbridge, southbridge and the nForce 200 PCI-E bridge.<ref name=\"AMD790FX_NV780i_TDP\" />\n\nIn response to this, all discrete northbridges of the chipset series were designed on a [[65 nm]] [[CMOS]] process, manufactured by [[TSMC]], aimed at lowering power consumptions of chipsets.

Alternatively, systems with multiple video card CrossFire X setup will support multiple [[Computer display|display monitors]] up to eight.\n\nFor the AMD 790FX chipset, the [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire X]] technology allows up to 4 video cards to be connected, made possible as the chipset supports four physical [[PCI-E]] x16 slots.<ref name=\"Chile2\"/> The [[PCI-E]] lanes can be configured for 4 slots at x8 bandwidth or 2 slots at x16 bandwidth (16x-16x, 8x-8x-8x or 8x-8x-8x-8x CrossFire X setup). Reports indicate 2.6 times the performance with triple-card CrossFire than that of a single card,<ref name=\"fud1\" /> and more than 3.3 times the performance increase for quad-card CrossFire. [[Gigabyte Technology|Gigabyte]] have revealed in a leaked product presentation that the four card CrossFire X setup does not require CrossFire connectors; the data will be exchanged among the PCI-E slots which is monitored and controlled by Catalyst drivers.\n\nFor the performance segment, CrossFire on the AMD 790X chipset has two physical [[PCI-E]] x16 slots<ref name=\"Chile2\"/> with one operating at x8 bandwidth (dual-card 8x-8x CrossFire), supporting up to four [[Computer display|display monitors]].\n\nMulti-graphics is also supported for the 790GX IGP chipset, named as [[AMD Hybrid Graphics#Hybrid CrossFire / Hybrid CrossFireX / Dual Graphics|Hybrid CrossFire X]].\n\n===AMD OverDrive===\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = AMD OverDrive\n| title                  = AMD OverDrive\n| logo                   = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| screenshot             = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| caption                = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = \n| developer              = [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]\n| released               = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 4.2.6.0638\n| latest release date    = 2013 February 6 <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| programming language   = \n| operating system       = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| status                 = \n| genre                  = Performance tuning\n| license                = Proprietary\n| website                = {{URL|https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/amd-overdrive}}\n}}\nAnother feature is AMD OverDrive, an application designed to boost system performance through a list of items in real-time, without a system reboot, as listed below:\n\n*Real-time Overclocking:\n**Novice mode for users not familiar with system tuning, includes a slider of level 0 to 10 for easy system tuning\n**Advanced mode for more familiar enthusiasts to fine tune various system parameters including: Clock frequencies &ndash; independent clock frequencies for independent processor cores (Phenom processors only), [[PCI Express|PCI-E]] lanes, system bus frequency; Multipliers for each of the CPU cores and [[HyperTransport]] links (downward direction only except Black Edition processors); And voltages for CPU ([[Voltage Identification Digital|VID]] and V<sub>DDC</sub>), CPU [[HyperTransport]], DDR2 Memory (V<sub>DDQ</sub> and V<sub>TT</sub>), [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] core (V<sub>Core</sub>) and Northbridge [[PCI Express|PCI-E]].

ACC is supported by the SB710 and the SB750 southbridges, and available through BIOS settings on some motherboards and AMD OverDrive utility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/2573/2 |title=AMD's SB750: Enabling Higher Phenom Overclocks? |publisher=AnandTech |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>\n\nIt was later discovered that this functionality has the possibility of unlocking the supposedly disabled cores of some Phenom II X2/X3 processors. In normal cases, it is not possible to use or unlock any of those hidden cores because originally those cores were disabled: a technique called \"chip harvesting\" or \"feature binning\" used by AMD to sell parts with one or two defective cores which will cause system instability if not disabled.\n\nThe following are available through the Advanced Clock Calibration feature:\n# Auto or manual settings\n# Allow separate settings for each of the CPU cores\n# Allowed range: -12% to +12%\n# Possibility of unlocking AMD Phenom II X2/X3, AMD Athlon II X2/X3 and AMD Sempron locked cores / cache.

While NVIDIA also has a similar technology for its [[nForce 700#nForce 780a|nForce 780a]] motherboards, called NVCC (NVIDIA Clock Calibration) with very similar functionality.\n\n===Energy efficiency===\nOne of the major focus of the chipset series is the energy efficiency of the chipsets. The need for energy-efficient chipsets have risen since chipsets starts including more features and more [[PCI Express]] lanes, to provide better system scalability by using PCI-E add-on cards.\n\nBut one issue is that chipset circuitries were usually made on a larger fabrication process nodes compared with the latest CPU process node, making recent chipsets consume more and more power than their predecessors. Recent examples including the [[Intel G33|Intel X38 chipset]] Northbridge (MCH), labelling 26.5 [[Watt|W]] [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] with a maximum idle power of 12.3 W,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/designex/31761201.pdf |title=Intel Thermal and Mechanical Design Guidelines &ndash; For the Intel 82X38 Memory Controller Hub (MCH).

Although the aforementioned figures may be small compared to the TDP figures of a performance CPU, there is a growing demand for computer systems with higher performance and lower power consumption. While Intel focuses only on the energy efficiency of its processors, NVIDIA's [[nForce 700#nForce 7xx|nForce 780i]] chipset requires an overall power consumption of 48 W with the northbridge, southbridge and the nForce 200 PCI-E bridge.<ref name=\"AMD790FX_NV780i_TDP\" />\n\nIn response to this, all discrete northbridges of the chipset series were designed on a [[65 nm]] [[CMOS]] process, manufactured by [[TSMC]], aimed at lowering power consumptions of chipsets.

The other part is a [[flash controller]] on an [[AT Attachment|ATA]] connector, with similar [[latch (electronics)|latch]]es/socket ejectors as SO-DIMM sockets.
