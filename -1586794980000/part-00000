{"title_page": "Armagil Waad", "text_new": "'''Armagil Waad''' (or '''Armigill Wade''') (ca. 1511 \u2013 20 June 1568) was a chief clerk of the Privy Council, servant of government and an English parliamentarian.\n\n==Early life==\nHe is said to have been born at [[Kilnsey]], [[Yorkshire]], near [[Conistone]], and his mother\u2019s maiden name is given as Comyn.  On the dissolution of the monasteries Kilnsey was granted to Sir [[Richard Gresham]], to whom Armagil may have owed his introduction at court.\n\nWaad was educated at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], whence he graduated B.A. on 23 January 1531-2.<ref>Oxford Univ. Reg. i. 167</ref><ref>Fasti, p. 86</ref>  He is then said to have entered some inn, possibly the Middle Temple, as his name does occur in the registers of the other three principal inns of court.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Exploration===\nIn 1536 he joined as an adventurer in [[Richard Hore]]\u2019s voyage to North America; he sailed with [[Oliver Daubeney]], \u2018Mr. Joy, afterwards gentleman of the king\u2019s chapel,\u2019 and others in the Minion from [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], towards the end of April. After about two months\u2019 sailing they reached [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]; they also visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Penguin Island (now known as [[Funk Island]]). They steered a northerly course home, fell in with icebergs, though it was the middle of summer, and reached [[St Ives, Cornwall]] about the end of October. Waad is said to have written an account of this voyage, which was afterwards printed. No such work has been traced, and it is not in [[Richard Hakluyt#Works|Hakluyt]], which, however, contains an account of the voyage furnished by one of Waad\u2019s companions, Thomas Butts, son of Sir [[William Butts]].<ref>Hakluyt, iii. 129-31</ref><ref>BROWN, Genesis U.S.A. i 2</ref><ref>Harrisse, John Cabot and his Son, 1896, pp. 123, 340</ref> Sir William Waad\u2019s description of his father as the first English explorer of America, subsequently paraphrased into \u2018the English Columbus\u2019 rests on this voyage. It has little justification. Waad has no more title to the name than his companions on the Minion, and infinitely less than the sixteen Englishmen who accompanied [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], not to mention the possibility that were English sailors among Columbus\u2019s crews.\n\n===Public service===\nAfter his return Waad seems to have entered the service of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VIII]], probably as a messenger. In 1540, on the recommendation of [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Lord Maltravers]], the lord deputy, Waad was promoted clerk of the council at Calais. He was promoted third clerk of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#History|privy council]] in London at midsummer 1547, serving at first without a regular salary, though he was paid for special services, like arresting a Frenchman (probably Jean Ribauld) when he tried to escape to France.<ref>[[#Acts|''Acts P.C.'']] 1547-50, pp. 113, 184</ref> On 22 September 1547 he was elected member of parliament for [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Chipping Wycombe]], and on 17 April 1548 began to draw a regular salary of fifty marks as third clerk of the council. Four years later he had risen to be [[Clerk of the Privy Council (United Kingdom)|chief clerk]], in which capacity he was paid 50''l''. a year. In July 1550 he was employed as the channel of communication with the French and Spanish ambassadors, on 20 December 1551 he was ordered to make an inventory of [[Cuthbert Tunstall]]\u2019s goods, in April 1552 he brought certain accusations against the [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex#Marriages and children|Countess of Sussex]] and was himself instructed to examine her in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], and on 31 May following he was commissioned to procure [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Paget]]\u2019s signature to the articles against him.<ref>[[#Acts|''Acts P.C.'']] 1550-2, pp. 82, 324, 449, 1552-4 pp.20, 65</ref>\n\nThe last mention of him as clerk occurs on 13 June 1553, and there can be little doubt that he lost his office on [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]\u2019s accession. He also lost his seat in parliament, and possibly a post in the customs which he had bought, and of which, as he subsequently complained to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Cecil]], he was deprived without compensation. In 1554 he was, however, granted by the crown the manor of [[Milton Grange]], Bedfordshire, in [[Milton Bryan]]. He also acquired lands in [[Kentish Town]] and at [[Lydd]], Kent, and subsequently leased [[Belsize Park]], Hampstead, which he made his home, from the dean and chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. On 17 December 1555 he was summoned to account for 800''l''. paid him by Sir Andrew Judd. Waad does not appear to have been restored to the clerkship of the council on the accession of Elizabeth; but on 15 April 1559 he was sent on a mission as ambassador to the Duke of [[Holstein]].<ref>[[#Sloane|Index to Sloane MS]]</ref> He was instructed to seek increased facilities for English merchants in the duke\u2019s dominions, to report on his relations with the free cities in his duchy, to offer [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]\u2019s aid in repressing the attempts of the said \u2018stades\u2019 to recover their liberties and to suggest \u2018some further intelligence\u2019 between the duke and England for the purpose of maintaining the [[Augsburg Confession]].<ref>Harl. MC. 36, No. 15</ref><ref>Addit. MS. 5935, f. 198</ref><ref>[[#CSPF|Cal. State Papers Foreign]] 1558-1559, Nos. 531, 541</ref>  In June 1562 he was sent to Rye to muster six hundred men for service at Havre, and to collect information about the movements of French parties and the readiness of the Huguenots to accept English help. In December he requested a grant of the salt marshes between Lydd and the mouth of the Camber, with license to enclose them. In 1566 he was engaged in examining at the Tower Cornelius de Alneto or Lannoy, an alchemist who had failed to redeem his promise of manufacturing gold for the queen\u2019s service.<ref>Hatfield MSS. Vol. i. passim</ref><ref>[[#CSPD|Cal. State Papers Domestic]] i. 275-7</ref>\n\n==Family and later life==\nWaad died at Belsize on 20 June 1568, and was buried in [[Hampstead]] church, where an alabaster monument, with a long inscription was erected to his memory by his son William. Owing to the rebuilding of Hampstead church in 1745 and three subsequent restorations, no trace of the monument remains. His will was proved in the prerogative court of the archbishop of Canterbury.<ref>[[#TNAwill|TNA probate]]</ref>\n\nWaad was twice married; firstly, to Alice, daughter of Richard Patten (d. 1536), widow of Thomas Searle, and sister of [[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]], the historian of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset\u2019s]] 1547 expedition into Scotland, and secondly to Anne Marbury, the widow of Edward Bradley (d.1558), a London haberdasher. According to Waad's epitaph he had 20 children by his two wives, 14 of whom predeceased him. All his surviving children were from his first marriage. The eldest surviving son was [[William Wade (English politician)|Sir William Waad]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hicks|2008}}.</ref>\n\nHe was also a good Spanish scholar.<ref>[[#CSPF|Cal. State Papers Foreign]], 1563, No. 545</ref>\n\n==Waad's writings==\nBesides the \u2018Observations\u2019 on his travels attributed to him, Waad was author of:\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=7&CATID=-4316353 ''The Distresses of the Commonwealth, with the Means to remedy them''], an elaborate treatise preserved at the record office.<ref>[[#CSPD|Cal.

On the dissolution of the monasteries Kilnsey was granted to Sir [[Richard Gresham]], to whom Armagil may have owed his introduction at court.\n\nWaad was educated at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], whence he graduated B.A. on 23 January 1531-2.<ref>Oxford Univ. Reg. i. 167</ref><ref>Fasti, p. 86</ref>  He is then said to have entered some inn, possibly the Middle Temple, as his name does occur in the registers of the other three principal inns of court.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Exploration===\nIn 1536 he joined as an adventurer in [[Richard Hore]]\u2019s voyage to North America; he sailed with [[Oliver Daubeney]], \u2018Mr. Joy, afterwards gentleman of the king\u2019s chapel,\u2019 and others in the Minion from [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], towards the end of April. After about two months\u2019 sailing they reached [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]; they also visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Penguin Island (now known as [[Funk Island]]). They steered a northerly course home, fell in with icebergs, though it was the middle of summer, and reached [[St Ives, Cornwall]] about the end of October. Waad is said to have written an account of this voyage, which was afterwards printed. No such work has been traced, and it is not in [[Richard Hakluyt#Works|Hakluyt]], which, however, contains an account of the voyage furnished by one of Waad\u2019s companions, Thomas Butts, son of Sir [[William Butts]].<ref>Hakluyt, iii. 129-31</ref><ref>BROWN, Genesis U.S.A. i 2</ref><ref>Harrisse, John Cabot and his Son, 1896, pp. 123, 340</ref> Sir William Waad\u2019s description of his father as the first English explorer of America, subsequently paraphrased into \u2018the English Columbus\u2019 rests on this voyage. It has little justification. Waad has no more title to the name than his companions on the Minion, and infinitely less than the sixteen Englishmen who accompanied [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], not to mention the possibility that were English sailors among Columbus\u2019s crews.\n\n===Public service===\nAfter his return Waad seems to have entered the service of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VIII]], probably as a messenger. In 1540, on the recommendation of [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Lord Maltravers]], the lord deputy, Waad was promoted clerk of the council at Calais. He was promoted third clerk of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#History|privy council]] in London at midsummer 1547, serving at first without a regular salary, though he was paid for special services, like arresting a Frenchman (probably Jean Ribauld) when he tried to escape to France.<ref>[[#Acts|''Acts P.C.'']] 1547-50, pp. 113, 184</ref> On 22 September 1547 he was elected member of parliament for [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Chipping Wycombe]], and on 17 April 1548 began to draw a regular salary of fifty marks as third clerk of the council. Four years later he had risen to be [[Clerk of the Privy Council (United Kingdom)|chief clerk]], in which capacity he was paid 50''l''. a year. In July 1550 he was employed as the channel of communication with the French and Spanish ambassadors, on 20 December 1551 he was ordered to make an inventory of [[Cuthbert Tunstall]]\u2019s goods, in April 1552 he brought certain accusations against the [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex#Marriages and children|Countess of Sussex]] and was himself instructed to examine her in the [[Tower of London|Tower]], and on 31 May following he was commissioned to procure [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Paget]]\u2019s signature to the articles against him.<ref>[[#Acts|''Acts P.C.'']] 1550-2, pp. 82, 324, 449, 1552-4 pp.20, 65</ref>\n\nThe last mention of him as clerk occurs on 13 June 1553, and there can be little doubt that he lost his office on [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]\u2019s accession. He also lost his seat in parliament, and possibly a post in the customs which he had bought, and of which, as he subsequently complained to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Cecil]], he was deprived without compensation. In 1554 he was, however, granted by the crown the manor of [[Milton Grange]], Bedfordshire, in [[Milton Bryan]]. He also acquired lands in [[Kentish Town]] and at [[Lydd]], Kent, and subsequently leased [[Belsize Park]], Hampstead, which he made his home, from the dean and chapter of St. Paul\u2019s. On 17 December 1555 he was summoned to account for 800''l''. paid him by Sir Andrew Judd. Waad does not appear to have been restored to the clerkship of the council on the accession of Elizabeth; but on 15 April 1559 he was sent on a mission as ambassador to the Duke of [[Holstein]].<ref>[[#Sloane|Index to Sloane MS]]</ref> He was instructed to seek increased facilities for English merchants in the duke\u2019s dominions, to report on his relations with the free cities in his duchy, to offer [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]\u2019s aid in repressing the attempts of the said \u2018stades\u2019 to recover their liberties and to suggest \u2018some further intelligence\u2019 between the duke and England for the purpose of maintaining the [[Augsburg Confession]].<ref>Harl. MC. 36, No. 15</ref><ref>Addit. MS. 5935, f. 198</ref><ref>[[#CSPF|Cal. State Papers Foreign]] 1558-1559, Nos. 531, 541</ref>  In June 1562 he was sent to Rye to muster six hundred men for service at Havre, and to collect information about the movements of French parties and the readiness of the Huguenots to accept English help. In December he requested a grant of the salt marshes between Lydd and the mouth of the Camber, with license to enclose them. In 1566 he was engaged in examining at the Tower Cornelius de Alneto or Lannoy, an alchemist who had failed to redeem his promise of manufacturing gold for the queen\u2019s service.<ref>Hatfield MSS. Vol. i. passim</ref><ref>[[#CSPD|Cal. State Papers Domestic]] i. 275-7</ref>\n\n==Family and later life==\nWaad died at Belsize on 20 June 1568, and was buried in [[Hampstead]] church, where an alabaster monument, with a long inscription was erected to his memory by his son William. Owing to the rebuilding of Hampstead church in 1745 and three subsequent restorations, no trace of the monument remains. His will was proved in the prerogative court of the archbishop of Canterbury.<ref>[[#TNAwill|TNA probate]]</ref>\n\nWaad was twice married; firstly, to Alice, daughter of Richard Patten (d. 1536), widow of Thomas Searle, and sister of [[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]], the historian of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset\u2019s]] 1547 expedition into Scotland, and secondly to Anne Marbury, the widow of Edward Bradley (d.1558), a London haberdasher. According to Waad's epitaph he had 20 children by his two wives, 14 of whom predeceased him. All his surviving children were from his first marriage. The eldest surviving son was [[William Wade (English politician)|Sir William Waad]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hicks|2008}}.</ref>\n\nHe was also a good Spanish scholar.<ref>[[#CSPF|Cal. State Papers Foreign]], 1563, No. 545</ref>\n\n==Waad's writings==\nBesides the \u2018Observations\u2019 on his travels attributed to him, Waad was author of:\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=7&CATID=-4316353 ''The Distresses of the Commonwealth, with the Means to remedy them''], an elaborate treatise preserved at the record office.<ref>[[#CSPD|Cal.

{"title_page": "Popular front", "text_new": "{{other uses|Popular Front (disambiguation)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2017}}\nA '''popular front''' is a broad [[coalition]] of different political groupings, usually made up of [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] and [[Centrism|centrists]]. They are very broad and sometimes include centrist [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] or [[liberalism|liberal]] forces as well as [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[communism|communist]] groups. Popular fronts are larger in scope than [[united front]]s.\n\nIn addition to the general definition, the term \"popular front\" also has a specific meaning in the history of 1930s [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] and in the history of [[Communist Parties]]. During this time, the ''[[Popular Front (France)|front populaire]]'' referred to the alliance of political parties in France that was aimed at resisting fascism.\n\nThe term \"national front\" is similar in name but describes a different form of ruling, using ostensibly-noncommunist parties that were in fact controlled by and subservient to the Communist Party as part of a \"coalition\", which was used in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nNot all coalitions who use the term \"popular front\" meet the definition for \"popular fronts\", and not all popular fronts use the term \"popular front\" in their name. The same applies to \"united fronts\".\n\n==Comintern policy: 1934\u20131939==\n[[File:37-howard-this4thofjuly.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of an American communist pamphlet from the Popular Front that used patriotic themes under the slogan \"Communism is the [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] of the 20th Century.\"]]\n\n===Germany===\nUntil early 1933, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was regarded as the world's most successful communist party in terms of membership and electoral results. As a result, the [[Communist International]], or Comintern, expected national Communist Parties to base their political style on the German example. That approach, known as the \"class against class\" strategy, or the [[ultra-left]] \"[[Third Period]]\", expected that the economic crisis and the trauma of war would increasingly radicalise public opinion and that if the communists remained aloof from mainstream democratic politics, they would benefit from the populist mood and be swept to power. As such, non-communist socialist parties were denounced as \"[[social fascist]]\".\n\nAfter a series of financial crises in [[Occupation of the Ruhr|1926]], [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929]] and [http://centraleuropeaneconomicandsocialhistory.com/the-great-depression-credit-anstalt-crisis-1931 1931], public opinion in Europe was certainly radicalising but not to the benefit of left-wing anticapitalist parties. In the weeks that followed Hitler's rise to power in February 1933, the German Communist Party and the Comintern clung rigidly to their view that the Nazi triumph would be brief and that it would be a case of \"after Hitler{{snd}} our turn\". However, as the brutality of the Nazi government became clear and there was no sign of its collapse, communists began to sense that there was a need for a radical alteration of their stance, especially as Hitler had made it clear that he regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy state.\n\nIn several countries over the previous years, a sense had grown within elements of the Communist Parties that the German model of \"class against class\" was not the most appropriate way to succeed in their national political contexts and that it was necessary to build some alliance to prevent the greater threat of autocratic nationalist governments. However, figures such as Barb\u00e9 and C\u00e9lor in France and Bullejos and Adama in Spain, who advocated greater flexibility by co-operating loyally with social-democratic parties and possibly even left-wing capitalist parties, were removed from positions of power. Predecessors to the Popular Front had existed, such as in the (later-renamed) [[World Committee Against War and Fascism|World Committee Against War and Imperialism]], but they sought not to co-operate with other parties as equals but instead to draw potential sympathisers into the orbit of the communist movement, which caused them to be denounced by the leaders of other left-wing associations.\n\nIt was thus not until 1934 when [[Georgi Dimitrov]], who had humiliated the Nazis with his defence against charges of involvement in the [[Reichstag Fire]] became the general secretary of the Comintern, and its officials became more receptive to the approach. Official acceptance of the new policy was first signalled in a ''[[Pravda]]'' article of May 1934, which commented favourably on socialist-communist collaboration.<ref name=\"libcom.org\">[http://libcom.org/library/1914-1946-third-camp-internationalists-france-during-world-war-ii 1914-1946: Third Camp Internationalists in France during World War II, libcom.org]</ref> The reorientation was formalised at the Comintern's Seventh Congress in July 1935 and reached its apotheosis with the proclamation of a new policy: \"The People's Front Against Fascism and War\". Communist Parties were now instructed to form broad alliances with all antifascist parties with the aim of securing social advance at home as well as a military alliance with the Soviet Union to isolate the fascist dictatorships. The \"popular fronts\" thus formed proved to be successful politically in forming governments in France, Spain and China but not elsewhere elsewhere.<ref>Archie Brown, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2009) pp 88-100.</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn France, the collapse of a leftist government coalition [[Cartel des Gauches|of social-democrats and left-liberal republicans]], followed by the [[6 February 1934 crisis|far-right riots]], which brought to power an [[Gaston Doumergue|autocratic right-wing government]], changed the equation. To resist a slippery slope of encroachment toword [[authoritarianism]], socialists were now more inclined to operate in the street and communists to co-operate with other antifascists in Parliament. In June 1934, [[L\u00e9on Blum]]'s socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] signed a pact of united action with the [[French Communist Party]]. By October, the Communist Party had begun to suggest that the republican parties that had not sided with the nationalist government might also be included, and it accepted the offer the next July after the French government [[Pierre Laval|tilted even further to the right]].\n\nIn May 1935, France and the Soviet Union signed a defensive alliance, and in August 1935, the [[7th World Congress of the Comintern]] officially endorsed the Popular Front strategy.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/7th-congress/index.htm The Seventh Congress, Marxist Internet Archive]</ref> In the elections of May 1936, the Popular Front won a majority of parliamentary seats (378 deputies against 220), and Blum formed a government.<ref name=\"libcom.org\" /> In Italy, the Comintern advised an alliance between the [[Italian Communist Party]] and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], but the latter rejected the idea.\n\n===Great Britain===\nThere were attempts in Great Britain to found a popular front, against the [[UK National Government|National Government]]'s appeasement of [[Nazi Germany]], between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the [[Independent Labour Party]], the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] and even rebellious elements of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Winston Churchill]], but they failed mainly because of opposition from within the Labour Party, which was seething with anger over communist efforts to take over union locals. In addition, the incompatibility of liberal and socialist approaches also caused many Liberals to be hostile.<ref>[\nhttp://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28_joyce_the_liberal_party_and_the_popular_front.pdf Peter Joyce, The Liberal Party and the Popular Front: an assessment of the arguments over progressive unity in the 1930s], ''Journal of Liberal History'', Issue 28, Autumn 2000</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) had been quite hostile to the New Deal until 1935, but it suddenly reversed positions and tried to form a popular front with the New Dealers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank A.

The communists also then offered support to [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]. The Popular Front saw the Communist Party taking a very patriotic and populist line, later called [[Browderism]].\n\nThe Popular Front has been summarized by historian Kermit McKenzie as:\n\n{{quote|\n...An imaginative, flexible program of strategy and tactics, in which Communists were permitted to exploit the symbols of patriotism, to assume the role of defenders of national independence, to attack fascism without demanding an end to [[capitalism]] as the only remedy, and, most important, to enter upon alliances with other parties, on the basis of fronts or on the basis of a government in which Communists might participate.<ref name=KM159>Kermit E. McKenzie, ''Comintern and World Revolution, 1928-1943: The Shaping of a Doctrine.'' London and New York: Columbia University Press, 1964; p. 159.</ref>}}\n\nMcKenzie asserted that to be a mere tactical expedient, with the broad goals of communists for the overthrow of capitalism through revolution remaining unchanged.<ref name=KM159 />\n\n===End of popular fronts===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThey are period suddenly came to an end with the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939. Comintern parties turned from a policy of [[antifascism]] to one of advocating peace with Germany. Many party members quit the party in disgust at the agreement between Hitler and Stalin, but many communists in France and other countries refused to enlist in their countries' forces until June 1941 since until then, Stalin was not at war with Hitler.\n\n===Critics and defenders of policy===\n[[Leon Trotsky]] and his far-left supporters roundly criticised the strategy. Trotsky believed that only [[united fronts]] could ultimately be progressive and that popular fronts were useless because they included bourgeois forces such as liberals. Trotsky also argued that in popular fronts, working-class demands are reduced to their bare minimum, and the ability of the working class to put forward its own independent set of politics is compromised. That view is now common to most [[Trotskyist]] groups. [[Left communism|Left communist]] groups also oppose popular fronts, but they came to oppose united fronts as well.\n\nIn a book written in 1977, the [[eurocommunist]] leader [[Santiago Carrillo]] offered a positive assessment of the Popular Front. He argued that in Spain, despite the excesses attributable to the passions of civil war, the period of coalition government in Republican areas \"contained in embryo the conception of an advance to socialism with democracy, with a multi-party system, parliament, and liberty for the opposition\".<ref>Santiago Carrillo, ''Eurocommunism and the State.'' London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1977; p. 128.</ref> Carrillo, however criticised the Communist, International for not taking the Popular Front strategy far enough, especially since French communists were restricted to supporting Blum's government from without, rather than becoming full coalition partners.<ref>Carrillo, ''Eurocommunism and the State,'' pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\n==Soviet bloc==\nAfter [[World War II]], most Central and Eastern European countries were ruled by coalitions between several different political parties that voluntarily chose to work together. By the time that the countries in what became the [[Soviet bloc]] had developed into Marxist-Leninist states, the non-Communist parties had pushed out their more radical members and was now ruled by [[fellow travelers]]. As a result, the front had turned communist.\n\nFor example, [[East Germany]] was ruled by a \"National Front\" of all antifascist parties and movements within Parliament ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal Party]], [[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany|Farmers' Party]], [[Free German Youth|Youth Movement]], [[Free German Trade Union Federation|Trade Union Federation]] etc.). At legislative elections, voters were presented with a single list of candidates from all parties.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g46dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Populism+in+America:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia+%5B2+volumes%5D&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC2ubk3Z3VAhVl4oMKHUUpAfsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=popular%20front&f=false], p. 542</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[United Front (China)|United Front]] is perhaps the best known example of a communist-run popular front in modern times. It is nominally a coalition of the [[Communist Party of China]] and eight minor parties. Though all parties had origins in independent parties prior to the [[Chinese Civil War]], noncommunists eventually splintered out to join the Nationalists, and the parties remaining in [[amMainland China]] allied with either Communist Party sympathizers or, in some cases, actual members.<ref>Judicial politics as state-building, Zhu, Suli, Pp. 23\u201336 in St\u00e9phanie Balme and Michael W. Dowdle (eds.), Building Constitutionalism in China.New York: Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>\n\n===Soviet republics===\nIn the [[republics of the Soviet Union]], between around 1988 and 1992 (when the USSR had dissolved, and the republics were all independent), the term \"Popular Front\" had quite a different meaning. It referred to movements led by members of the liberal-minded intelligentsia (usually themselves members of the local Communist Party), in some republics small and peripheral but in others broad-based and influential. Officially, their aim was to defend ''[[perestroika]]'' against reactionary elements within the state bureaucracy, but over time, they began to question the legitimacy of their republics' membership of the Soviet Union. It was their initially cautious tone that gave them considerable freedom to organise and to gain access to the mass media. In the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]], they soon became the dominant political force and gradually gained the initiative from the more radical dissident organisations established earlier by moving their republics towards greater autonomy and then independence. They also became the main challengers to the Communist Parties' hegemony in [[Belarusian Popular Front|Belarus]], Moldova, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A Popular Front was established in Georgia but remained marginal, compared to the dominant dissident-led groups, since the [[April 9 tragedy]] had radicalised society and so it was unable to play the compromise role of similar movements. In the other republics, such organisations existed but never posed a meaningful threat to the incumbent party and economic elites.<ref>Wheatley, Jonathan.

They are very broad and sometimes include centrist [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] or [[liberalism|liberal]] forces as well as [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[communism|communist]] groups. Popular fronts are larger in scope than [[united front]]s.\n\nIn addition to the general definition, the term \"popular front\" also has a specific meaning in the history of 1930s [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] and in the history of [[Communist Parties]]. During this time, the ''[[Popular Front (France)|front populaire]]'' referred to the alliance of political parties in France that was aimed at resisting fascism.\n\nThe term \"national front\" is similar in name but describes a different form of ruling, using ostensibly-noncommunist parties that were in fact controlled by and subservient to the Communist Party as part of a \"coalition\", which was used in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nNot all coalitions who use the term \"popular front\" meet the definition for \"popular fronts\", and not all popular fronts use the term \"popular front\" in their name. The same applies to \"united fronts\".\n\n==Comintern policy: 1934\u20131939==\n[[File:37-howard-this4thofjuly.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of an American communist pamphlet from the Popular Front that used patriotic themes under the slogan \"Communism is the [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] of the 20th Century.\"]]\n\n===Germany===\nUntil early 1933, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was regarded as the world's most successful communist party in terms of membership and electoral results. As a result, the [[Communist International]], or Comintern, expected national Communist Parties to base their political style on the German example. That approach, known as the \"class against class\" strategy, or the [[ultra-left]] \"[[Third Period]]\", expected that the economic crisis and the trauma of war would increasingly radicalise public opinion and that if the communists remained aloof from mainstream democratic politicd, they would benefit from the populist mood and be swept to power. As such, non-communist socialist parties were denounced as \"[[social fascist]]\".\n\nAfter a series of financial crises in [[Occupation of the Ruhr|1926]], [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929]] and [http://centraleuropeaneconomicandsocialhistory.com/the-great-depression-credit-anstalt-crisis-1931 1931], public opinion in Europe was certainly radicalising but not to the benefit of left-wing anticapitalist parties. In the weeks that followed Hitler's rise to power in February 1933, the German Communist Party and the Comintern clung rigidly to their view that the Nazi triumph would be brief and that it would be a case of \"after Hitler{{snd}} our turn\". However, as the brutality of the Nazi government became clear and there was no sign of its collapse, communists began to sense that there was a need for a radical alteration of their stance, especially as Hitler had made it clear that he regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy state.\n\nIn several countries over the previous years, a sense had grown within elements of the Communist Parties that the German model of \"class against class\" was not the most appropriate way to succeed in their national political contexts and that it was necessary to build some alliance to prevent the greater threat of autocratic nationalist governments. However, figures such as Barb\u00e9 and C\u00e9lor in France and Bullejos and Adama in Spain, who advocated greater flexibility by co-operating loyally with social-democratic parties and possibly even left-wing capitalist parties, were removed from positions of power. Predecessors to the Popular Front had existed, such as in the (later-renamed) [[World Committee Against War and Fascism|World Committee Against War and Imperialism]], but they sought not to co-operate with other parties as equals but instead to draw potential sympathisers into the orbit of the communist movement, which caused them to be denounced by the leaders of other left-wing associations.\n\nIt was thus not until 1934 when [[Georgi Dimitrov]], who had humiliated the Nazis with his defence against charges of involvement in the [[Reichstag Fire]] became the general secretary of the Comintern, and its officials became more receptive to the approach. Official acceptance of the new policy was first signalled in a ''[[Pravda]]'' article of May 1934, which commented favourably on socialist-communist collaboration.<ref name=\"libcom.org\">[http://libcom.org/library/1914-1946-third-camp-internationalists-france-during-world-war-ii 1914-1946: Third Camp Internationalists in France during World War II, libcom.org]</ref> The reorientation was formalised at the Comintern's Seventh Congress in July 1935 and reached its apotheosis with the proclamation of a new policy: \"The People's Front Against Fascism and War\". Communist Parties were now instructed to form broad alliances with all antifascist parties with the aim of securing social advance at home as well as a military alliance with the Soviet Union to isolate the fascist dictatorships. The \"popular fronts\" thus formed proved to be successful politically in forming governments in France, Spain and China but not elsewhere elsewhere.<ref>Archie Brown, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2009) pp 88-100.</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn France, the collapse of a leftist government coalition [[Cartel des Gauches|of social-democrats and left-liberal republicans]], followed by the [[6 February 1934 crisis|far-right riots]], which brought to power an [[Gaston Doumergue|autocratic right-wing government]], changed the equation. To resist a slippery slope of encroachment toword [[authoritarianism]], socialists were now more inclined to operate in the street and communists to co-operate with other antifascists in Parliament. In June 1934, [[L\u00e9on Blum]]'s socialist [[French Section of the Workers' International]] signed a pact of united action with the [[French Communist Party]]. By October, the Communist Party had begun to suggest that the republican parties that had not sided with the nationalist government might also be included, and it accepted the offer the next July after the French government [[Pierre Laval|tilted even further to the right]].\n\nIn May 1935, France and the Soviet Union signed a defensive alliance, and in August 1935, the [[7th World Congress of the Comintern]] officially endorsed the Popular Front strategy.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/7th-congress/index.htm The Seventh Congress, Marxist Internet Archive]</ref> In the elections of May 1936, the Popular Front won a majority of parliamentary seats (378 deputies against 220), and Blum formed a government.<ref name=\"libcom.org\" /> In Italy, the Comintern advised an alliance between the [[Italian Communist Party]] and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], but the latter rejected the idea.\n\n===Great Britain===\nThere were attempts in Great Britain to found a popular front, against the [[UK National Government|National Government]]'s appeasement of [[Nazi Germany]], between the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the [[Independent Labour Party]], the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] and even rebellious elements of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Winston Churchill]], but they failed mainly because of opposition from within the Labour Party, which was seething with anger over communist efforts to take over union locals. In addition, the incompatibility of liberal and socialist approaches also caused many Liberals to be hostile.<ref>[\nhttp://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28_joyce_the_liberal_party_and_the_popular_front.pdf Peter Joyce, The Liberal Party and the Popular Front: an assessment of the arguments over progressive unity in the 1930s], ''Journal of Liberal History'', Issue 28, Autumn 2000</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) had been quite hostile to the New Deal until 1935, but it suddenly reversed positions and tried to form a popular front with the New Dealers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank A.

The Popular Front saw the Communist Party taking a very patriotic and populist line, later called [[Browderism]].\n\nThe Popular Front has been summarized by historian Kermit McKenzie as:\n\n{{quote|\n...An imaginative, flexible program of strategy and tactics, in which Communists were permitted to exploit the symbols of patriotism, to assume the role of defenders of national independence, to attack fascism without demanding an end to [[capitalism]] as the only remedy, and, most important, to enter upon alliances with other parties, on the basis of fronts or on the basis of a government in which Communists might participate.<ref name=KM159>Kermit E. McKenzie, ''Comintern and World Revolution, 1928-1943: The Shaping of a Doctrine.'' London and New York: Columbia University Press, 1964; p. 159.</ref>}}\n\nMcKenzie asserted that to be a mere tactical expedient, with the broad goals of communists for the overthrow of capitalism through revolution remaining unchanged.<ref name=KM159 />\n\n===End of popular fronts===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThey are period suddenly came to an end with the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939. Comintern parties turned from a policy of [[antifascism]] to one of advocating peace with Germany. Many party members quit the party in disgust at the agreement between Hitler and Stalin, but many communists in France and other countries refused to enlist in their countries' forces until June 1941 since until then, Stalin was not at war with Hitler.\n\n===Critics and defenders of policy===\n[[Leon Trotsky]] and his far-left supporters roundly criticised the strategy. Trotsky believed that only [[united fronts]] could ultimately be progressive and that popular fronts were useless because they included bourgeois forces such as liberals. Trotsky also argued that in popular fronts, working-class demands are reduced to their bare minimum, and the ability of the working class to put forward its own independent set of politics is compromised. That view is now common to most [[Trotskyist]] groups. [[Left communism|Left communist]] groups also oppose popular fronts, but they came to oppose united fronts as well.\n\nIn a book written in 1977, the [[eurocommunist]] leader [[Santiago Carrillo]] offered a positive assessment of the Popular Front. He argued that in Spain, despite the excesses attributable to the passions of civil war, the period of coalition government in Republican areas \"contained in embryo the conception of an advance to socialism with democracy, with a multi-party system, parliament, and liberty for the opposition\".<ref>Santiago Carrillo, ''Eurocommunism and the State.'' London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1977; p. 128.</ref> Carrillo, however criticised the Communist, International for not taking the Popular Front strategy far enough, especially since French communists were restricted to supporting Blum's government from without, rather than becoming full coalition partners.<ref>Carrillo, ''Eurocommunism and the State,'' pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\n==Soviet bloc==\nAfter [[World War II]], most Central and Eastern European countries were ruled by coalitions between several different political parties that voluntarily chose to work together. By the time that the countries in what became the [[Soviet bloc]] had developed into Marxist-Leninist states, the non-Communist parties had pushed out their more radical members and was now ruled by [[fellow travelers]]. As a result, the front had turned communist.\n\nFor example, [[East Germany]] was ruled by a \"National Front\" of all antifascist parties and movements within Parliament ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal Party]], [[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany|Farmers' Party]], [[Free German Youth|Youth Movement]], [[Free German Trade Union Federation|Trade Union Federation]] etc.). At legislative elections, voters were presented with a single list of candidates from all parties.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g46dAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Populism+in+America:+A+Historical+Encyclopedia+%5B2+volumes%5D&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC2ubk3Z3VAhVl4oMKHUUpAfsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=popular%20front&f=false], p. 542</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[United Front (China)|United Front]] is perhaps the best known example of a communist-run popular front in modern times. It is nominally a coalition of the [[Communist Party of China]] and eight minor parties. Though all parties had origins in independent parties prior to the [[Chinese Civil War]], noncommunists eventually splintered out to join the Nationalists, and the parties remaining in [[amMainland China]] allied with either Communist Party sympathizers or, in some cases, actual members.<ref>Judicial politics as state-building, Zhu, Suli, Pp. 23\u201336 in St\u00e9phanie Balme and Michael W. Dowdle (eds.), Building Constitutionalism in China.New York: Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>\n\n===Soviet republics===\nIn the [[republics of the Soviet Union]], between around 1988 and 1992 (when the USSR had dissolved, and the republics were all independent), the term \"Popular Front\" had quite a different meaning. It referred to movements led by members of the liberal-minded intelligentsia (usually themselves members of the local Communist Party), in some republics small and peripheral but in others broad-based and influential. Officially, their aim was to defend ''[[perestroika]]'' against reactionary elements within the state bureaucracy, but over time, they began to question the legitimacy of their republics' membership of the Soviet Union. It was their initially cautious tone that gave them considerable freedom to organise and to gain access to the mass media. In the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]], they soon became the dominant political force and gradually gained the initiative from the more radical dissident organisations established earlier by moving their republics towards greater autonomy and then independence. They also became the main challengers to the Communist Parties' hegemony in [[Belarusian Popular Front|Belarus]], Moldova, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan. A Popular Front was established in Georgia but remained marginal, compared to the dominant dissident-led groups, since the [[April 9 tragedy]] had radicalised society and so it was unable to play the compromise role of similar movements. In the other republics, such organisations existed but never posed a meaningful threat to the incumbent party and economic elites.<ref>Wheatley, Jonathan.
