It was written by [[Pete Astudillo]] and produced by Selena's brother-producer [[A.B. Quintanilla]]. \"Si Una Vez\" is a [[mariachi]] [[fusion music|fusion]] song and draws influence from [[cumbia music|cumbia]] and [[Latin dance|Latin dance music]]. Lyrically, Selena questions why she ever fell in love with an abusive partner, saying she will never repeat her mistakes. The lyrics suggest [[unrequited love]] and female empowerment.\n\n\"Si Una Vez\" received positive reviews from music critics who found the song to have showcase the singer's vocal abilities. The [[Broadcast Music Inc.]] recognized it as the Single of the Year at the 1996 BMI Pop Awards. Many musicians have since recorded the song and released it on their respective albums including Mexican mariachi singer [[Alicia Villareal]], American reggaeton performer [[Ivy Queen]], American indie rock band [[Girl in a Coma]], and American salsa singer [[Manny Manuel]]. The latter's version peaked at number one on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Tropical Songs]] chart, and ended 1995 as the [[List of number-one Billboard Hot Tropical Songs from the 1990s|fourteenth most successful U.S. tropical song]].\n\n== Background and composition ==\n\"Si Una Vez\" was written by [[Selena y Los Dinos]] backup dancer and vocalist [[Pete Astudillo]].<ref name=\"albumnotes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Amor Prohibido |titlelink=Amor Prohibido|others=[[Selena]] |year=2002|publisher=[[EMI Latin]] |id=724354099403}}</ref> The song was co-written by [[Selena]]'s brother-producer [[A.B.

Despite losing the first match to Queensland the tour was a great success, the Lions winning the Test series against the [[All Blacks]]. They are still the only Lions side to have won a Test series in New Zealand. The side was captained by [[John Dawes]], coached by [[Carwyn James]] and managed by [[Doug Smith (rugby union)|Doug Smith]].\n\nAlthough the Lions had done poorly when touring New Zealand in 1966 (they lost all four Tests to the All Blacks), the seeds had been sown for the successful series of 1971. Wales had won the [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)#Six Nations Championship|Grand Slam]] in the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] in 1971, and appropriately supplied more players than any other home nation to the touring squad. Both the coach and captain were also Welsh. This was the only tour to result in a Lions victory over the All Blacks. A major factor in their victory was self belief. [[Gerald Davies]] explained, \"...somewhere along the line it becomes a mental thing...We grew in confidence; we came to believe it was possible to beat the All Blacks.\"<ref>Palenski, R: ''Century in Black, 100 Years of All Black Test Rugby'', page 122.

Several Lions players later admitted they were overconfident following their initial Test victory. The Lions were thus convincingly beaten 22\u201312 in the [[#Second Test|second Test]] in Christchurch, with the All Blacks outscoring them five tries (Bob Burgess (2), [[Sid Going]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick]], pen try) to two (Davies (2)). The [[#Third Test|third Test]] was played at [[Athletic Park (Wellington)|Athletic Park]], Wellington. The Lions did not make the same mistake they had in Christchurch, resulting in a 13\u20133 win, the Lions scored two converted tries and a drop goal. The All Blacks managed only a try.\n\nFollowing the third Test the Lions led the series 2\u20131. The final game played in [[Auckland]] would require an All Black victory for New Zealand to draw the series. A draw or Lions victory would give the Lions a series win. Scores were level 8\u20138 at half time with a try, conversion and penalty each. The first 15 minutes of the second half saw the Lions land a penalty goal and the All Blacks score a try. With the scores tied 11\u201311, Lions [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] [[JPR Williams]] received the ball 45 metres out and attempted a drop goal, it was successful and put the Lions ahead 14\u201311. Williams's drop goal was the only one he landed in his Test career. The All Blacks could only manage three further points from a penalty to draw the game 14-14, which gave the Lions the series.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Backs===\n* [[John Dawes]] ([[London Welsh R.F.C.|London Welsh]] and Wales) (captain)\n* [[J.P.R.

The All Blacks managed only a try.\n\nFollowing the third Test the Lions led the series 2\u20131. The final game played in [[Auckland]] would require an All Black victory for New Zealand to draw the series. A draw or Lions victory would give the Lions a series win. Scores were level 8\u20138 at half time with a try, conversion and penalty each. The first 15 minutes of the second half saw the Lions land a penalty goal and the All Blacks score a try. With the scores tied 11\u201311, Lions [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] [[JPR Williams]] received the ball 45 metres out and attempted a drop goal, it was successful and put the Lions ahead 14\u201311. Williams's drop goal was the only one he landed in his Test career. The All Blacks could only manage three further points from a penalty to draw the game 14-14, which gave the Lions the series.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Backs===\n* [[John Dawes]] ([[London Welsh R.F.C.|London Welsh]] and Wales) (captain)\n* [[J.P.R.

It was situated between the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion (Budapest Metro)|Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion]] and the [[Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Budapest Metro)|Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar]] metro stations. It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion bej\u00e1rat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion makettje az 1952. \u00e1prilis 4 \u00fcnneps\u00e9gen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]\n\nThe first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].\n\nIn 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.\n\nThe location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. ker\u00fclete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. ker\u00fclete|Budapest X. district]].\n\nIn 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.\n\nThe stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''N\u00e9pstadion''' (\"People's Stadium\").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7\u20131).\n\nOn 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1\u20130 with [[B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

It was situated between the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion (Budapest Metro)|Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc Stadion]] and the [[Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar (Budapest Metro)|Keleti p\u00e1lyaudvar]] metro stations. It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion bej\u00e1rat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion makettje az 1952. \u00e1prilis 4 \u00fcnneps\u00e9gen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]\n\nThe first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].\n\nIn 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.\n\nThe location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. ker\u00fclete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. ker\u00fclete|Budapest X. district]].\n\nIn 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.\n\nThe stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''N\u00e9pstadion''' (\"People's Stadium\").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7\u20131).\n\nOn 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1\u20130 with [[B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:\n\n*work or [[career]] (or lack of them)\n*spousal relationships (or lack of them)\n*maturation of children (or lack of children)\n*aging or death of parents\n*physical changes associated with aging\n\nMid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking [[intimacy]] with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do men go through midlife crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>  A man's midlife crises is more likely to be caused by work issues,<ref name=\"auto4\"/> a woman's crisis by personal evaluations of their roles. Even though there are differences between why men and women go through a midlife crisis, the emotions they both encounter can be intense.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a mid-life crisis perspective, is one assumes that their mid-life is about to be eventful, usually in a negative way, and potentially stressful. Psychologist Oliver Robinson's research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person's early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death. Such a deadline may convince a middle-aged person that their life needs to be lived as expected.<ref name=\"apa.org\"/>\n\nIndividuals experiencing a mid-life crisis may feel:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y5nTBgAAQBAJ&dq=Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital%20comprehensive%20clinical%20psychiatry|title=Massachusetts General Hospital Comprehensive Clinical Psychiatry|first1=Theodore A.|last1=Stern|first2=Maurizio|last2=Fava|first3=Timothy E.|last3=Wilens|first4=Jerrold F.|last4=Rosenbaum|date=13 February 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|via=Google Books|isbn=9780323328999}}</ref>\n\n*a deep sense of remorse for goals that have not been accomplished\n*a fear of humiliation among more successful colleagues\n*longing to achieve a feeling of youthfulness\n*need to spend more time alone or with certain peers\n*a heightened sense of their [[sexuality]] or lack of it\n* [[boredom|ennui]], confusion, resentment or anger due to their discontent with their marital, work, health, economic, or social status\n*ambitious to right the missteps they feel they have taken early in life<ref>{{cite web|title=Warning Signs of a Midlife Crisis|website=Drphil.com|url=http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/694}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prevention==\nPhysical changes that commonly occur during these years are weight gain, wrinkles, sagging skin, hair loss.<ref>MedlinePlus.

An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Dr. Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of [[generativity]] when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of [[motivation]] to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes a normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.<ref name=\"Online Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/generativity|website=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical basis ==\nThe notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of [[Sigmund Freud]], who thought that during middle age everyone\u2019s thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Scientific American MIND Magazine] February 2009 article titled \"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Ask the Brains: Is the Midlife Crisis a Myth?]\" by David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University</ref> Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in [[popular culture]] than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. [[Jungian theory]] holds that mid-life is key to [[individuation]], a process of [[self-actualization]] and [[self-awareness]] that contains many potential paradoxes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/individuationprocess.htm | title=The Individuation Process}}</ref> Although [[Carl Jung]] did not describe midlife crisis ''per se'', the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one's life and goals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Erik Erikson]]'s life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stagnation Stagnation] is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.

The authors hypothesized that the \"culture of youth\" in Western societies accounts for the popularity of the mid-life crisis concept there. \n \nResearchers have found that mid-life is often a time for reflection and reassessment, but this is not always accompanied by the psychological upheaval popularly associated with \"mid-life crisis.\"<ref name=\"auto1\">Erik H.

A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:\n\n*work or [[career]] (or lack of them)\n*spousal relationships (or lack of them)\n*maturation of children (or lack of children)\n*aging or death of parents\n*physical changes associated with aging\n\nMid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking [[intimacy]] with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do men go through midlife crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>  A man's midlife crises is more likely to be caused by work issues,<ref name=\"auto4\"/> a woman's crisis by personal evaluations of their roles. Even though there are differences between why men and women go through a midlife crisis, the emotions they both encounter can be intense.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a mid-life crisis perspective, is one assumes that their mid-life is about to be eventful, usually in a negative way, and potentially stressful. Psychologist Oliver Robinson's research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person's early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death. Such a deadline may convince a middle-aged person that their life needs to be lived as expected.<ref name=\"apa.org\"/>\n\nIndividuals experiencing a mid-life crisis may feel:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y5nTBgAAQBAJ&dq=Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital%20comprehensive%20clinical%20psychiatry|title=Massachusetts General Hospital Comprehensive Clinical Psychiatry|first1=Theodore A.|last1=Stern|first2=Maurizio|last2=Fava|first3=Timothy E.|last3=Wilens|first4=Jerrold F.|last4=Rosenbaum|date=13 February 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|via=Google Books|isbn=9780323328999}}</ref>\n\n*a deep sense of remorse for goals that have not been accomplished\n*a fear of humiliation among more successful colleagues\n*longing to achieve a feeling of youthfulness\n*need to spend more time alone or with certain peers\n*a heightened sense of their [[sexuality]] or lack of it\n* [[boredom|ennui]], confusion, resentment or anger due to their discontent with their marital, work, health, economic, or social status\n*ambitious to right the missteps they feel they have taken early in life<ref>{{cite web|title=Warning Signs of a Midlife Crisis|website=Drphil.com|url=http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/694}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prevention==\nPhysical changes that commonly occur during these years are weight gain, wrinkles, sagging skin, hair loss.<ref>MedlinePlus.

An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Dr. Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of [[generativity]] when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of [[motivation]] to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes a normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.<ref name=\"Online Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/generativity|website=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical basis ==\nThe notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of [[Sigmund Freud]], who thought that during middle age everyone\u2019s thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Scientific American MIND Magazine] February 2009 article titled \"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Ask the Brains: Is the Midlife Crisis a Myth?]\" by David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University</ref> Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in [[popular culture]] than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. [[Jungian theory]] holds that mid-life is key to [[individuation]], a process of [[self-actualization]] and [[self-awareness]] that contains many potential paradoxes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/individuationprocess.htm | title=The Individuation Process}}</ref> Although [[Carl Jung]] did not describe midlife crisis ''per se'', the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one's life and goals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Erik Erikson]]'s life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stagnation Stagnation] is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.

Also referred to as the '''5K road race''', '''5&nbsp;km''', or simply '''5K''', it is the shortest of the most common road running distances. It is usually distinguished from the [[5000 metres]]  [[track running]] event by stating the distance in kilometres, rather than metres. The quickest 5k is ran by Darragh Fitzpatrick from Pollerton, Carlow who ran 5k in 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n\nAmong road running events, the 5K distance is mostly popular with novice or infrequent runners or [[jogging|joggers]], as it is comparatively easier to complete the distance without [[endurance training]]. This also makes the distance suitable for people looking to improve or maintain their general [[physical fitness]], rather than develop long-distance running abilities. The brevity of the distance means that less time is required to take part in the activity and that people from a wide range of ages and abilities may participate. From a [[Exercise physiology|physiological]] perspective, five kilometres is towards the low end of endurance running.<ref>Wolfe-Bieler, Kristen (2007-06-08).

Also referred to as the '''5K road race''', '''5&nbsp;km''', or simply '''5K''', it is the shortest of the most common road running distances. It is usually distinguished from the [[5000 metres]]  [[track running]] event by stating the distance in kilometres, rather than metres.\n\nAmong road running events, the 5K distance is mostly popular with novice or infrequent runners or [[jogging|joggers]], as it is comparatively easier to complete the distance without [[endurance training]]. This also makes the distance suitable for people looking to improve or maintain their general [[physical fitness]], rather than develop long-distance running abilities. The brevity of the distance means that less time is required to take part in the activity and that people from a wide range of ages and abilities may participate. From a [[Exercise physiology|physiological]] perspective, five kilometres is towards the low end of endurance running.<ref>Wolfe-Bieler, Kristen (2007-06-08).

When clasping the hands, a person tends to interlace the fingers in one of two ways. People who hold the fingers of the right hand above the left fingers are classified as [[phenotype]] ''R'' (right), while those who hold the fingers of the left hand above those of the right are phenotype ''L'' (left).\n\nAlthough some people do not exhibit a preference for one type of hand clasping, most do. Once adopted, the method of hand clasping tends to be consistent throughout life. When an individual attempts to clasp the hands in the opposite configuration from the usual one, that person may feel a sense that something is out of the ordinary.\n\nIt was noted that the ''R'' type occurs more frequently in women than in men, which led to popular speculation that all persons with ''L'' phenotype are more emotional than persons with ''R'' type.{{Dubious|date=February 2016}}<ref>Ferronato S., Thomas D., Sadava D.

They are known for representing Wales in Europe as winners of the [[Cymru Premier]] and [[Welsh Cup]] during the 1990s and early 2000s and have also competed in England's [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and [[FA Cup]]. The team, which has contained more than 50 full internationals, is now run by supporters. They play at their traditional home of [[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]], Barry, which holds 3,500 spectators.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Steel\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = White\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Wightman\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Molyneux\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Thomas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Greenaway\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Bates\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Woolridge\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = McNaught\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Sheldon\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Isherwood\n| caption = First ever Barry XI at Jenner Park\n}}\nBarry Town United's history dates back to 1892 when an [[association football]] team named '''Barry and Cadoxton District''' was formed in the area. During the early years, this side endured many upheavals, playing on five different grounds under various identities, including '''Barry Unionist Athletic''', '''Barry United Athletic''' and '''Barry District'''. Players who featured during these years included [[Ted Vizard]] and [[Billy Jennings]]; who would each go on to play in the famous [[1923 FA Cup Final|\u2018White Horse\u2019 FA Cup Final]].\n [[File:The inaugural Barry team photo, taken in 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Barry AFC team photograph, featuring players/officials of 1913\u201314]]\nIn November 1912, a meeting at The Windsor [[public house]] in Holton Road saw townsfolk choose to pursue membership of the thriving [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] as '''Barry AFC''' (the 'Town' suffix was added after [[World War II]]). The club would secure land owned by the Jenner family and the people of the town came together to build [[Jenner Park]], ahead of the first match of the [[1912\u201313 in English football|1912\u201313 season]].\n\nOn 6 September 1913, Barry played their first ever fixture; a [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] match against [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] at [[Jenner Park]]. The game attracted 4,000 spectators, including 1,000 travelling supporters.\n\nFittingly, the new team would register a surprise, albeit merited, victory, with Barry's Ralph Isherwood scoring the very first goal at [[Jenner Park]] just three minutes in. His second, midway through the second half, sealed a 2\u20131 victory, a fine start for the Barry side on, coincidentally, the same afternoon that [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] played their first ever match at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]].\n\nThe ensuing two seasons would see [[Stoke City]], [[Brentford FC|Brentford]], [[Coventry City]] and others visit the new ground. However, the [[World War I|Great War]] would soon interrupt any competitive proceedings; with Barry captain Major James Wightman one of the many casualties of [[The Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Southern League success===\nThe [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] season ranks as one of the finest in Barry's history, as they surprised many by becoming champions of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Welsh section. The achievement was all the more impressive when considering the small Barry squad played over 100 matches in all competitions during the course of the season. Competing simultaneously in both the Welsh and [[Western Football League|Western League]], the Barry board gave priority to Southern League fixtures, swayed by aspirations of joining the new [[League 2|English Third Division]].\n\nInspired by [[Stanley Cowie]], the title was clinched in early May, and yet hopes of Barry being able to move up to the [[Football League]] were scuppered just a month later, when their application failed and [[Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] (the latter of whom finished second to Barry in their section) were elected instead.\n\nBarry retained membership of the Southern League for more than 60 years \u2013 their highest finish being fourth in the 1930s. Among the notable players of the era were Johnny Gardner (with over 500 appearances), Dai Ward (scorer of more than 300 goals) and [[Fred Whitlow]] (a 100+ goal marksman). Meanwhile, Barry-born sportsman [[Ernie Carless]] combined his footballing exploits with a successful cricketing career with [[Glamorgan CCC|Glamorgan]].\n\n===FA Cup and Welsh Cup glory===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Morris\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = Williams\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Lyske\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Bright\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Bellas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Dyke\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Foxton\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Allen\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = Niblett\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Goodfellow\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Cain\n| caption = 1955 Welsh Cup winning XI\n}}\nAt the end of the [[1920s (decade)|1920s]], a crowd of 6,000 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] saw Barry beat [[Dagenham]] 1\u20130 to progress to the [[FA Cup]] 2nd Round; before losing to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]] ten days later. It proved to be their most successful run in the competition. Barry would reach the 1st Round again in [[1934\u201335 FA Cup|1934\u201335]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Northampton Town]] at Jenner Park, but the build-up to the match was tainted by a fire that ravaged the grandstand.\n\nFootball again took a backseat in 1939, with the eruption of World War II . Barry's Chris Mason would be captured as a [[prisoner of war]] during the conflict, though would return to Jenner Park to resume his career afterwards; entertaining spectators thrilled by the adventures of players such as [[Derek Tapscott]] (who would later sign for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]), celebrated striker [[Stan Richards (footballer)|Stan Richards]] and Gwilym 'Cannonball' Cain.\n\nIn the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]] season, Jenner Park became one of the first grounds in the country to introduce [[floodlights]], with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City]] all visiting to showcase the facilities. Two seasons later, an all-Welsh showdown in the FA Cup 1st Round saw Barry beaten by Newport, 4\u20130. Nevertheless, the town's most celebrated footballing achievement was right around the corner.\n\nIn May 1955, following a 1\u20131 draw at [[the Racecourse]] in [[Wrexham]], Barry beat [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] 4\u20133 at [[Ninian Park]] to lift the Welsh Cup for the first time. Former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] right-wing Charlie Dyke scored the winner, a dramatic late free-kick to take the cup back to Barry.\n\n===1960s, 1970s and 1980s===\nIn the late [[1950s (decade)|1950s]], a host of [[Scandinavia]]n stars made their way to Jenner Park, and dazzled Barry football enthusiasts with their skill. Among their number were [[Finland]]\u2019s Hannu Kankkonen and [[Bengt Berndtsson|Bengt \u2018Folet\u2019 Berndtsson]]; a member of the [[Sweden football team|Sweden]] squad that reached the final of the [[1958 World Cup]]. The influx of players from continental [[Europe]] came as a result of chairman John Bailey's business interests overseas.\n\nDuring this period, the club embarked on an overseas tour, playing three games in [[Malta]] in 1960 against [[Sliema Wanderers]], [[Hibernians FC|Hibernians]] and [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] that all ended in draws.\n\n1961 saw another big match as [[QPR]] visited Jenner Park in the FA Cup. A crowd of 7,000 saw [[Laurie Sheffield]]\u2019s opener for Barry cancelled out late on. QPR would win the replay at [[Loftus Road]] comfortably. The [[1960s (decade)|1960s]] and [[1970s (decade)|70s]] are perhaps most fondly remembered for the personalities that pulled on the Barry shirt. Among them, prolific goalscorers Ken Gully and Clive Ayres, brothers John and Dickie Batt, long-serving Bobby Smith and [[Ashley Griffiths]], and tall defender Mike Cosslett; now a member of the club coaching staff.\n\nIn 1982, Barry would leave the Southern League, focusing on Welsh League competition and winning six Welsh League titles before the decade's end; thanks in no small part to the goals of striker Steve Williams. The most significant match of the decade though came on 17 November 1984, as 3,850 crammed into Jenner Park to see Barry vs [[Reading FC|Reading]] in the FA Cup 1st Round. Despite Ian Love's goal, an injury-time winner by [[Trevor Senior]] was enough to send the Royals through.\n\n===Exile and return===\n[[File:Barri in Worcester, 1992-93.jpg|thumb|right|Barri in Worcester, 1992\u201393]]\nAfter insufficient floodlighting had stopped the club being able to compete in the Southern League for most of the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the tail end of the decade saw the necessary ground improvements to support a return to England. Barry entered the league's Midland Division and would consistently finish in the top six, yet were denied the opportunity to field a reserve XI in the Welsh League as they had done previously.\n\nThe creation of the [[League of Wales]] (now [[Cymru Premier]]) in 1992 then prompted a decree that Barry would no longer be able to compete in the [[English football pyramid|English pyramid]] at all while based on Welsh soil. As part of a group of rebel clubs known as the [[1992\u201393 League of Wales|Irate Eight]] (alongside [[Newport County AFC|Newport]], [[Merthyr Tydfil FC|Merthyr]], [[Colwyn Bay FC|Colwyn Bay]], [[Bangor City]], [[Caernarfon Town]], [[Newtown AFC|Newtown]] and [[Rhyl FC|Rhyl]]), the Town were forced into exile; with the first team adopting the name of '''Barri AFC''' and playing 'home' matches out of [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]]\u2019s ground, while the reserves (by now, a local league outfit), manned the Jenner Park fort. However, this arrangement would last only one season, as chairman O\u2019 Halloran performed a shock u-turn that saw the Barry first team return home; eventually accepted into [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League Division One]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] campaign.\n\n===Decade of dominance===\n[[File:Barry in Lithuania in the summer of 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Barry (in yellow) in action in [[Lithuania]] in the summer of 1994]]\nBarry's return to Jenner Park would spark the side's most successful period, as they earned immediate promotion to the top flight and a unique quadruple of [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]], [[FAW Trophy]] and [[Welsh Cup]] (for the first time since 1955).\n\nThe latter was one of the Town's most famous achievements, as they upset [[Football League Second Division]] outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in front of 16,000 spectators at the old [[Cardiff Arms Park|National Stadium]]. Barry's reward for winning the [[Welsh Cup]] was a [[European Cup Winners Cup]] tie against [[FK Zalgiris Vilnius|\u017dalgiris Vilnius]] of [[Lithuania]], but they crashed out 7\u20130 on aggregate. Greater glory was on the horizon.\n\nAfter one season in the [[League of Wales]], Barry opted to become the league's first fully professional club and, thereafter, won their first league championship in [[1995\u201396 League of Wales|1995\u201396]]. The season was though marred by the deaths of chairman Neil O' Halloran and young midfielder Matthew Holtham, the latter in a [[motorway]] accident on the way back from an away match in April.\n\n1996 saw the club create history as the first [[League of Wales]] side to progress beyond the opening round of a European competition.\n\nFollowing victory in [[Latvia]] over [[Dinaburg FC|Dinaburg]], Barry ousted [[Hungary|Hungarian]] side [[BVSC Budapest|Budapest Vasutas]] in one of several epic European nights at [[Jenner Park]]. Despite trailing 3\u20131 from the away leg, Barry stormed to a victory in the return match by the same score-line, and then won a penalty shoot-out 4\u20132.\n\nA memorable all-British tie with [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] was their reward and, after losing 3\u20131 to [[Roy Aitken]]'s side at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]], the Welshmen were held to a pulsating 3\u20133 draw at a rain-swept [[Jenner Park]]; exiting the cup in thrilling fashion before a crowd of over 6,000. [[File:Barry of 1999 with League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Welsh Premier trophy.jpg|thumb|The Barry squad of 1999 at Jenner Park, with the League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Cymru Premier trophies.]]\n\nOn the domestic scene, Barry were all-conquering, clinching a first treble of [[League of Wales]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]] and [[Welsh Cup]]. The championship was claimed with a record 105 points and a goal difference of more than +100. In January 1997, the team was part of the first [[League of Wales]] match to be broadcast live on television; a 5\u20132 win over visitors [[Caernarfon Town]] that still holds the league's attendance record. Then, from March, Barry went 51 matches without tasting a single defeat in a league fixture.\n\n1999 saw Barry become the first [[League of Wales]] team to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]], with a 2\u20131 win over [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] at the club's own [[Racecourse Ground]]. Pipped to the title in 2000 by the emerging [[The New Saints F.C.|TNS]], Barry would regain their crown the following campaign, while European battles with the likes of [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] saw players of the highest calibre grace Jenner Park (among them, the likes of [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Sergei Rebrov]].)\n\nThen, in the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|2001\u201302]] season, Barry notably became the first [[League of Wales]] team to win a European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] tie, when they defeated the [[Azerbaijan]] champions [[FC Shamkir]] to set up a tie with Portuguese club [[FC Porto]]. Barry lost the first leg in [[Portugal]] by an emphatic 8\u20130 margin, after conceding two early penalties in front of a partisan 55,000 crowd. However, the Town would win the home leg 3\u20131, recording a famous result that has grown in legend with the career success of Porto's [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Helder Postiga]] and others.\n\n===Decline and turmoil===\nThe golden era would not last forever, and the continual challenge of securing enough prize money to sustain their high standards set would eventually catch up with those running the club. After chairperson and backer Paula O' Halloran stood aside, former [[Scarborough FC|Scarborough]] and [[Grantham Town FC|Grantham Town]] official Kevin Green came in as the club's new [[Chief Executive]]; yet his varying initiatives failed to stop the rot. In one move that garnered significant press, Green would recruit ex-footballer and celebrity [[John Fashanu]] as the club's high-profile chairman in the winter of 2002. Some saw Fashanu as the missing piece of the puzzle, and the man who would help sustain Barry's success going forward. Promising [[Africa]]n and [[China|Chinese]] TV deals and an influx of [[Nigeria]]n internationals, Fashanu made headlines, yet did little to steady a Barry ship in increasingly rough seas. Then, after success on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality show [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Series 2 .282003.29|I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]] saw him attain new-found popularity, Fashanu left the club; which by now was in a perilous financial state.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the club went into administration and the professional squad would quickly disintegrate. An interim management team was appointed, together with an amateur squad drawn primarily from local side N & M Construction of the [[South Wales Amateur League]] (five levels below the Welsh Premier). Within a month, Barry had gone from winning a match in Europe to losing 8\u20130 at [[Caernarfon Town]]. Though the professional-era bubble had well and truly burst, fans set about raising money to help keep the club alive. Eventually, mystery man Stuart Lovering arrived to purchase of the club on 10 December 2003. Few could have foreseen what was to come.\n\n[[2003\u201304 Welsh Premier League|2003\u201304]] was a difficult season, with champions Barry's first league win not coming until February 2004 when they beat fellow strugglers [[Welshpool Town F.C.|Welshpool Town]] 5\u20134 with a 98th-minute winning penalty from youngster Luke Sherbon. Manager [[Colin Addison]] was brought in resuscitate the team's ailing fortunes, yet the Dragons still ended up bottom of the division, four points off safety, and were relegated to the [[Welsh Football League Division One|Welsh League Division One]]. Controversially, Addison was dismissed by Lovering on the eve of the new campaign, with assistant [[David Hughes (footballer born 1978)|David Hughes]] replacing him; only to leave himself months later on finding his budget slashed. In the meantime, an independent [[Valuation Office Agency|district valuer]] had determined that the club should pay \u00a342,000 in rent and rates each season for the remainder of the lease. Judging the figure to be unfairly based on the club's relinquished professional status, Lovering refused to pay this amount and instead moved the senior side to the White Tips Stadium in [[Treforest]] from January 2005 to May 2006. During the absence, a number of staunch supporters formed breakaway club '''Barry FC'''; the culmination of a series of disputes with chairman Lovering, who had banned them from fundraising at club. With the Town relegated to their lowest-ever league status at the end of the [[2005\u201306 in Welsh football|2005\u201306]] season, the future appeared bleak for this fallen giant of Welsh football.\n\n===Fan-led fightback===\nWhile chaos reigned off the field for much of the decade, the roots of recovery began to grow in 2007, with the appointment of new manager Gavin Chesterfield. Chesterfield led Barry to promotion in 2008, with the hope that a winning run of form in the second tier would see the club's dwindling support return. After stumbling early on, Barry enjoyed a 21-match unbeaten streak and finished the season a credible third. Nevertheless, the team's achievements were continually overshadowed by events behind the scenes.\n\nIn December 2008, a crisis meeting at Jenner Park saw supporters come forward to pledge their commitment to operating the first team (forming a new company for this purpose), to allow Lovering to focus on finding a buyer. In one of a number of close calls, the club appeared on the verge of being sold in 2010, when businessman Clayton Jones appeared to strike a deal. However, this fell through at the eleventh hour, scuppering a plan to bring in [[Wales]] international [[John Hartson]] as [[Director of Football]].\n\nUndeterred, 2010 saw the '''Stand Up For Barry''' campaign launch, utilising new [[social media]] platforms such as [[Twitter]] to spread news of the club's plight with a wider online audience. The resulting support from across the football community proved an invaluable asset as supporters strived to keep the club alive.\n\nShortly after the close of the 2010\u201311 season, Lovering announced his fresh intent of withdrawing the first team from higher league competition. To prevent this, the '''Barry Town Supporters' Committee''' (BTSC) took complete control of all football and its funding; resulting in what became known to some supporters as the 'DIY Football' era. In the months that followed, the rejuvenated, fan-run Barry set-up enjoyed their most successful [[Welsh Cup]] campaign in several seasons; defeating rivals [[Merthyr Town]] at [[Penydarren Park]] and winning at [[Haverfordwest County]] in extra-time, before being edged out 3\u20132 at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]].\n\n[[File:Barry fans and players celebrate 2013 Welsh Cup success in Flint.jpg|thumb|left|A TV cameraman records Barry fans and players celebrating after their Welsh Cup Quarter Final win at [[Flint Town United]] on 2 March 2013.]]\n\n2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the club's [[wikt:formation|formation]], with a series of events lined up to mark this and the subsequent centenary season. To launch the festivities, the BTSC hosted [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in an August fundraising friendly attended by 2,000 spectators. However, Lovering's threats to withdraw Barry from the [[Welsh Football League]] would intensify in the weeks prior, threatening to cast a cloud over these celebrations. Nevertheless, the BTSC held a successful '100 Years of Barry Town' event at the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] (attended by many past and present players), before the current team beat Welsh League champions [[Cambrian & Clydach Vale B. & G.C.|Cambrian and Clydach]] on the 100th anniversary itself.\n\nIn March 2013, following wins against [[Caerleon FC|Caerleon]], [[Penrhyncoch F.C.|Penrhyncoch]], [[Ely Rangers]] and [[Pontardawe Town F.C.|Pontardawe Town]], Barry won 2\u20130 at [[Flint Town United]] to progress to the [[2012\u201313 Welsh Cup|Welsh Cup]] semi-final for the first time in a decade. Eventually, the team narrowly lost 1\u20132 to eventual winners [[Prestatyn Town]], marking the first ever appearance of a fully amateur Barry side at the Welsh Cup semi-final stage.\n\n===Survival and resurgence===\nOn 7 May 2013, Lovering withdrew the senior team from the [[Welsh Football League]], against the will of the BTSC, players and supporters; who were ready, willing and able to fulfill the remaining two league fixtures (both against [[Ton Pentre FC|Ton Pentre]]). Rejecting this perceived act of sabotage, those running the football outlined their intentions to continue as they were, adopting the '''Barry Town United''' suffix to emphasise their continuing unity and endeavour. However, a meeting of the [[Football Association of Wales|FAW]] Council in [[Betws-y-Coed]] in June 2013 announced that the Barry side would have to play \"recreational football\" henceforth; a declaration that prompted significant outcry, both locally and further afield.\n[[File:Maesmawr Hall, Caersws.jpg|thumb|Barry at [[Maesmawr Hall]] before [[Welsh Cup]] Semi-final in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]].]]\nThere appeared hope for beleaguered Barry as second meeting was arranged for July 2013 at [[Maesmawr Hall]] in [[Caersws]] to hear new evidence as why the team should be able to continue on. At this second gathering, 15 of the FAW Councillors voted against discussing Barry's future, thus concluding the meeting in no more than five minutes and at considerable expense. Notably, it emerged that this decision went against the recommendations of the FAW's own Domestic Committee and legal team.\n\nWith their immediate and long-term future unclear, Barry began their pre-season with wins at [[Moreton-in-Marsh|Moreton]] and [[Elmore, Gloucestershire|Elmore]] that same month, followed by a narrow 3\u20132 loss to [[Premier League]] newcomers [[Cardiff City]], watched by a home crowd of 1,650 supporters on Saturday 27 July. Remarkably, given the bizarre set of circumstances, Barry had led 2\u20131 at half-time.\n\nEventually, a [[High Court]] judge in Cardiff ruled in Barry's favour; stating that the FAW Council had acted unlawfully in denying them their licence to play Welsh League football. As a result, the fan-run Town side was entered back into the structure.\n\nIn the years that have followed, Barry would win two consecutive league titles, reclaiming their place in the second tier, while continuing to develop as a club, on and off the pitch. Today, the club competes at senior, development, youth and junior levels, along with various ladies' teams and pan disability sides in the over and under-16 age groups. In the 2016\u201317 season, the first team reached the final of [[Welsh League Cup]] for the first time since 2001, becoming only the second side from outside the national top flight to achieve this feat since the competition was expanded several years prior. In April 2017, the club secured its return to the [[Cymru Premier|Welsh Premier]] as champions of the [[Welsh Football League]], continuing this remarkable revival.\n\nOn Saturday 6 April 2019, a remarkable 5-2 victory away at Bala Town, coupled with a 6-0 win for The New Saints away against Newtown, ensured Barry Town United would finish at least third in the 2018-19 JD Cymru Premier and qualification for the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League. This marked a remarkable transformation for the club, qualifying for European competition for the first time since winning the JD Cymru Premier in the 2002-03 season.\n\n==Colours==\nFor many decades, Barry wore green as their primary colour \u2013 thought to be due to officials securing the club's first kit from [[Plymouth Argyle]]. On exile in 1992, Barri adopted a red and white strip, which would remain with them on their return to the Welsh pyramid. It was the following season that the club adopted its yellow change kit (deemed lucky for the success it brought in [[Welsh Cup]] competition) as a home strip \u2013 and it is this colour that has become synonymous with Town football, with variations including uses of blue.\n\nTwo of the club's most memorable home strips are the [[fluorescent]] lime and navy ordered in error in 2006, and the experimental [[claret]] and blue kit worn in the early 1970s \u2013 both of which saw the club simultaneously plummet in footballing fortune. Nowadays, the club tends to wear yellow at home and green on the road.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _green_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripeonright\n| pattern_ra = _green_stripes\n| leftarm    = \n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = \n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Example of a traditional Linnets green strip, worn with longevity.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = \n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 3399FF\n| body       = 7F1734\n| rightarm   = 3399FF\n| shorts     = \n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 7F1734\n| alt        = \n| title      = Claret and blue strip, worn for a single disastrous season (1971\u201372).\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _vneckwhite\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 339933\n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = 339933\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Green and blue strip, colour co-ordinated with Jenner Park seating.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FF0033\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FF0033\n| socks      = FF0033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Red and white strip, worn in exile and upon return to the Welsh pyramid.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _bluebuttoncollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFF33\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = FFFF33\n| shorts     = FFFF33\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_blue\n| socks      = FFFF33\n| alt        = \n| title      = Welsh Cup Final strip of 1994, worn in famous win over [[Cardiff City]].\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _yellowborder\n| pattern_b  = _collarblue\n| pattern_ra = _yellowborder\n| leftarm    = 3333CC\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = 3333CC\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_yellow\n| socks      = 3333CC\n| alt        = \n| title      = League of Wales strip, adopted from cup kit, associated with 1990s success.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _Safasc_Away\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 99FF00\n| body       = 99FF00\n| rightarm   = 99FF00\n| shorts     = 330033\n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 330033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Fluorescent lime strip, worn in post-Millennium descent to lowest status.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Jenner Park Stadium}}\n\n[[File:Jenner Park - Barry.jpg|thumb|Jenner Park Stadium, Barry]]\n\n[[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]] occupies the space of land between Gladstone Road and Barry Road in central [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] and has been the setting for the evolution of Barry's senior football club for more than 100 years.\n\nNamed after the Jenner family who had gifted the land, the ground was built by the Barry football enthusiasts for their representative side to compete at the highest possible level and was completed between the landmark meeting of 1912 and the opening fixture of [[1913\u201314 in English football|1913\u201314]].\n\nAmong the most notable Barry matches played at Jenner Park have been European ties, domestic cup finals, major semi-finals and quarter-finals, [[FA Cup]] fixtures, televised matches, testimonials, high-scoring thrillers and friendlies against high-profile opposition.\n\nComprised initially of two wooden stands, popular bank terracing was added in 1923 and floodlights added in the [[1940s (decade)|1940s]], allowing Jenner Park to host Wales' first ever floodlit football match between Barry and [[Newport County FC|Newport]] in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]].\n\nDuring the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the local council rebuilt [[Jenner Park]], installing a synthetic running track, a new all-seater stand and improved floodlights.\n\nIn order to bring [[Jenner Park]] up to [[UEFA]] standards, a second covered stand was built in the mid [[1990s (decade)|1990s]], boosting the [[seating capacity]] to 2,500. This was temporarily increased to 6,000+ for the visits of [[Aberdeen FC|Aberdeen]] and [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] with the use of temporary [[bleachers]].\n\nRecent years have seen the addition of a special viewing area for wheelchair users in the grandstand (known colloquially as the 'Old Stand'), accessible via the stadium's Devon Avenue entrance. Meanwhile, October 2015 saw work completed on a new, state-of-the-art [[3G pitch]], with its inaugural game, a [[Welsh Cup]] match against [[Aberdare Town F.C.|Aberdare Town]].\n\n==Current squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1 |pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Mike Lewis|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=2 |pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Paul Morgan|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=3|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Chris Hugh|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=4|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cooper|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=5|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Curtis Watkins|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=6|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Robbie Patten|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=7|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Kayne McLaggon]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=8|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Troy Greening|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=9|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Eli Phipps|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=10|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Jordan Cotterill|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=11|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Drew Fahiya|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=12|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cummings|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=14|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Jack Compton]]|other=}}\n{{fs_player|no=15|pos=MF|nat=SKN|name=[[Theo Wharton]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=16|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Jonathan Hood|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=17|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Keyon Reffell|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=24|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Callum Sainty|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=25|pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Joe Baker|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=26|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Lewis Cosslett| (loaned)|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=29|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Clayton Green|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=33|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=[[Evan Press]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=39  |pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=[[David Cotterill]]|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n\n===Technical staff===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The team, which has contained more than 50 full internationals, is now run by supporters. They play at their traditional home of [[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]], Barry, which holds 3,500 spectators.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Steel\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = White\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Wightman\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Molyneux\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Thomas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Greenaway\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Bates\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Woolridge\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = McNaught\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Sheldon\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Isherwood\n| caption = First ever Barry XI at Jenner Park\n}}\nBarry Town United's history dates back to 1892 when an [[association football]] team named '''Barry and Cadoxton District''' was formed in the area. During the early years, this side endured many upheavals, playing on five different grounds under various identities, including '''Barry Unionist Athletic''', '''Barry United Athletic''' and '''Barry District'''. Players who featured during these years included [[Ted Vizard]] and [[Billy Jennings]]; who would each go on to play in the famous [[1923 FA Cup Final|\u2018White Horse\u2019 FA Cup Final]].\n [[File:The inaugural Barry team photo, taken in 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Barry AFC team photograph, featuring players/officials of 1913\u201314]]\nIn November 1912, a meeting at The Windsor [[public house]] in Holton Road saw townsfolk choose to pursue membership of the thriving [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] as '''Barry AFC''' (the 'Town' suffix was added after [[World War II]]). The club would secure land owned by the Jenner family and the people of the town came together to build [[Jenner Park]], ahead of the first match of the [[1912\u201313 in English football|1912\u201313 season]].\n\nOn 6 September 1913, Barry played their first ever fixture; a [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] match against [[Mid Rhondda F.C.|Mid-Rhondda]] at [[Jenner Park]]. The game attracted 4,000 spectators, including 1,000 travelling supporters.\n\nFittingly, the new team would register a surprise, albeit merited, victory, with Barry's Ralph Isherwood scoring the very first goal at [[Jenner Park]] just three minutes in. His second, midway through the second half, sealed a 2\u20131 victory, a fine start for the Barry side on, coincidentally, the same afternoon that [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] played their first ever match at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]].\n\nThe ensuing two seasons would see [[Stoke City]], [[Brentford FC|Brentford]], [[Coventry City]] and others visit the new ground. However, the [[World War I|Great War]] would soon interrupt any competitive proceedings; with Barry captain Major James Wightman one of the many casualties of [[The Battle of the Somme]].\n\n===Southern League success===\nThe [[1920\u201321 in English football|1920\u201321]] season ranks as one of the finest in Barry's history, as they surprised many by becoming champions of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s Welsh section. The achievement was all the more impressive when considering the small Barry squad played over 100 matches in all competitions during the course of the season. Competing simultaneously in both the Welsh and [[Western Football League|Western League]], the Barry board gave priority to Southern League fixtures, swayed by aspirations of joining the new [[League 2|English Third Division]].\n\nInspired by [[Stanley Cowie]], the title was clinched in early May, and yet hopes of Barry being able to move up to the [[Football League]] were scuppered just a month later, when their application failed and [[Charlton Athletic]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] (the latter of whom finished second to Barry in their section) were elected instead.\n\nBarry retained membership of the Southern League for more than 60 years \u2013 their highest finish being fourth in the 1930s. Among the notable players of the era were Johnny Gardner (with over 500 appearances), Dai Ward (scorer of more than 300 goals) and [[Fred Whitlow]] (a 100+ goal marksman). Meanwhile, Barry-born sportsman [[Ernie Carless]] combined his footballing exploits with a successful cricketing career with [[Glamorgan CCC|Glamorgan]].\n\n===FA Cup and Welsh Cup glory===\n{{football squad on pitch|align = right\n| GK_nat  = WAL|  GK = Morris\n| RB_nat  = WAL|  RB = Williams\n| RCB_nat = WAL| RCB = Lyske\n| LCB_nat = WAL| LCB = Bright\n| LB_nat  = WAL|  LB = Bellas\n| RM_nat  = WAL|  RM = Dyke\n| RCM_nat = WAL| RCM = Foxton\n| LCM_nat = WAL| LCM = Allen\n| LM_nat  = WAL|  LM = Niblett\n| SS_nat  = WAL|  SS = Goodfellow\n| CF_nat  = WAL|  CF = Cain\n| caption = 1955 Welsh Cup winning XI\n}}\nAt the end of the [[1920s (decade)|1920s]], a crowd of 6,000 at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] saw Barry beat [[Dagenham]] 1\u20130 to progress to the [[FA Cup]] 2nd Round; before losing to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]] ten days later. It proved to be their most successful run in the competition. Barry would reach the 1st Round again in [[1934\u201335 FA Cup|1934\u201335]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Northampton Town]] at Jenner Park, but the build-up to the match was tainted by a fire that ravaged the grandstand.\n\nFootball again took a backseat in 1939, with the eruption of World War II . Barry's Chris Mason would be captured as a [[prisoner of war]] during the conflict, though would return to Jenner Park to resume his career afterwards; entertaining spectators thrilled by the adventures of players such as [[Derek Tapscott]] (who would later sign for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]), celebrated striker [[Stan Richards (footballer)|Stan Richards]] and Gwilym 'Cannonball' Cain.\n\nIn the [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]] season, Jenner Park became one of the first grounds in the country to introduce [[floodlights]], with [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Cardiff City]] all visiting to showcase the facilities. Two seasons later, an all-Welsh showdown in the FA Cup 1st Round saw Barry beaten by Newport, 4\u20130. Nevertheless, the town's most celebrated footballing achievement was right around the corner.\n\nIn May 1955, following a 1\u20131 draw at [[the Racecourse]] in [[Wrexham]], Barry beat [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] 4\u20133 at [[Ninian Park]] to lift the Welsh Cup for the first time. Former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] right-wing Charlie Dyke scored the winner, a dramatic late free-kick to take the cup back to Barry.\n\n===1960s, 1970s and 1980s===\nIn the late [[1950s (decade)|1950s]], a host of [[Scandinavia]]n stars made their way to Jenner Park, and dazzled Barry football enthusiasts with their skill. Among their number were [[Finland]]\u2019s Hannu Kankkonen and [[Bengt Berndtsson|Bengt \u2018Folet\u2019 Berndtsson]]; a member of the [[Sweden football team|Sweden]] squad that reached the final of the [[1958 World Cup]]. The influx of players from continental [[Europe]] came as a result of chairman John Bailey's business interests overseas.\n\nDuring this period, the club embarked on an overseas tour, playing three games in [[Malta]] in 1960 against [[Sliema Wanderers]], [[Hibernians FC|Hibernians]] and [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] that all ended in draws.\n\n1961 saw another big match as [[QPR]] visited Jenner Park in the FA Cup. A crowd of 7,000 saw [[Laurie Sheffield]]\u2019s opener for Barry cancelled out late on. QPR would win the replay at [[Loftus Road]] comfortably. The [[1960s (decade)|1960s]] and [[1970s (decade)|70s]] are perhaps most fondly remembered for the personalities that pulled on the Barry shirt. Among them, prolific goalscorers Ken Gully and Clive Ayres, brothers John and Dickie Batt, long-serving Bobby Smith and [[Ashley Griffiths]], and tall defender Mike Cosslett; now a member of the club coaching staff.\n\nIn 1982, Barry would leave the Southern League, focusing on Welsh League competition and winning six Welsh League titles before the decade's end; thanks in no small part to the goals of striker Steve Williams. The most significant match of the decade though came on 17 November 1984, as 3,850 crammed into Jenner Park to see Barry vs [[Reading FC|Reading]] in the FA Cup 1st Round. Despite Ian Love's goal, an injury-time winner by [[Trevor Senior]] was enough to send the Royals through.\n\n===Exile and return===\n[[File:Barri in Worcester, 1992-93.jpg|thumb|right|Barri in Worcester, 1992\u201393]]\nAfter insufficient floodlighting had stopped the club being able to compete in the Southern League for most of the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the tail end of the decade saw the necessary ground improvements to support a return to England. Barry entered the league's Midland Division and would consistently finish in the top six, yet were denied the opportunity to field a reserve XI in the Welsh League as they had done previously.\n\nThe creation of the [[League of Wales]] (now [[Cymru Premier]]) in 1992 then prompted a decree that Barry would no longer be able to compete in the [[English football pyramid|English pyramid]] at all while based on Welsh soil. As part of a group of rebel clubs known as the [[1992\u201393 League of Wales|Irate Eight]] (alongside [[Newport County AFC|Newport]], [[Merthyr Tydfil FC|Merthyr]], [[Colwyn Bay FC|Colwyn Bay]], [[Bangor City]], [[Caernarfon Town]], [[Newtown AFC|Newtown]] and [[Rhyl FC|Rhyl]]), the Town were forced into exile; with the first team adopting the name of '''Barri AFC''' and playing 'home' matches out of [[Worcester City F.C.|Worcester City]]\u2019s ground, while the reserves (by now, a local league outfit), manned the Jenner Park fort. However, this arrangement would last only one season, as chairman O\u2019 Halloran performed a shock u-turn that saw the Barry first team return home; eventually accepted into [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League Division One]] for the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] campaign.\n\n===Decade of dominance===\n[[File:Barry in Lithuania in the summer of 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Barry (in yellow) in action in [[Lithuania]] in the summer of 1994]]\nBarry's return to Jenner Park would spark the side's most successful period, as they earned immediate promotion to the top flight and a unique quadruple of [[Welsh Football League|Welsh League]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]], [[FAW Trophy]] and [[Welsh Cup]] (for the first time since 1955).\n\nThe latter was one of the Town's most famous achievements, as they upset [[Football League Second Division]] outfit [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in front of 16,000 spectators at the old [[Cardiff Arms Park|National Stadium]]. Barry's reward for winning the [[Welsh Cup]] was a [[European Cup Winners Cup]] tie against [[FK Zalgiris Vilnius|\u017dalgiris Vilnius]] of [[Lithuania]], but they crashed out 7\u20130 on aggregate. Greater glory was on the horizon.\n\nAfter one season in the [[League of Wales]], Barry opted to become the league's first fully professional club and, thereafter, won their first league championship in [[1995\u201396 League of Wales|1995\u201396]]. The season was though marred by the deaths of chairman Neil O' Halloran and young midfielder Matthew Holtham, the latter in a [[motorway]] accident on the way back from an away match in April.\n\n1996 saw the club create history as the first [[League of Wales]] side to progress beyond the opening round of a European competition.\n\nFollowing victory in [[Latvia]] over [[Dinaburg FC|Dinaburg]], Barry ousted [[Hungary|Hungarian]] side [[BVSC Budapest|Budapest Vasutas]] in one of several epic European nights at [[Jenner Park]]. Despite trailing 3\u20131 from the away leg, Barry stormed to a victory in the return match by the same score-line, and then won a penalty shoot-out 4\u20132.\n\nA memorable all-British tie with [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] was their reward and, after losing 3\u20131 to [[Roy Aitken]]'s side at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]], the Welshmen were held to a pulsating 3\u20133 draw at a rain-swept [[Jenner Park]]; exiting the cup in thrilling fashion before a crowd of over 6,000. [[File:Barry of 1999 with League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Welsh Premier trophy.jpg|thumb|The Barry squad of 1999 at Jenner Park, with the League of Wales Cup, FAW Premier Cup and Cymru Premier trophies.]]\n\nOn the domestic scene, Barry were all-conquering, clinching a first treble of [[League of Wales]] championship, [[Welsh League Cup]] and [[Welsh Cup]]. The championship was claimed with a record 105 points and a goal difference of more than +100. In January 1997, the team was part of the first [[League of Wales]] match to be broadcast live on television; a 5\u20132 win over visitors [[Caernarfon Town]] that still holds the league's attendance record. Then, from March, Barry went 51 matches without tasting a single defeat in a league fixture.\n\n1999 saw Barry become the first [[League of Wales]] team to win the [[FAW Premier Cup]], with a 2\u20131 win over [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] at the club's own [[Racecourse Ground]]. Pipped to the title in 2000 by the emerging [[The New Saints F.C.|TNS]], Barry would regain their crown the following campaign, while European battles with the likes of [[Dynamo Kiev]] and [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] saw players of the highest calibre grace Jenner Park (among them, the likes of [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Sergei Rebrov]].)\n\nThen, in the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|2001\u201302]] season, Barry notably became the first [[League of Wales]] team to win a European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] tie, when they defeated the [[Azerbaijan]] champions [[FC Shamkir]] to set up a tie with Portuguese club [[FC Porto]]. Barry lost the first leg in [[Portugal]] by an emphatic 8\u20130 margin, after conceding two early penalties in front of a partisan 55,000 crowd. However, the Town would win the home leg 3\u20131, recording a famous result that has grown in legend with the career success of Porto's [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Helder Postiga]] and others.\n\n===Decline and turmoil===\nThe golden era would not last forever, and the continual challenge of securing enough prize money to sustain their high standards set would eventually catch up with those running the club. After chairperson and backer Paula O' Halloran stood aside, former [[Scarborough FC|Scarborough]] and [[Grantham Town FC|Grantham Town]] official Kevin Green came in as the club's new [[Chief Executive]]; yet his varying initiatives failed to stop the rot. In one move that garnered significant press, Green would recruit ex-footballer and celebrity [[John Fashanu]] as the club's high-profile chairman in the winter of 2002. Some saw Fashanu as the missing piece of the puzzle, and the man who would help sustain Barry's success going forward. Promising [[Africa]]n and [[China|Chinese]] TV deals and an influx of [[Nigeria]]n internationals, Fashanu made headlines, yet did little to steady a Barry ship in increasingly rough seas. Then, after success on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality show [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Series 2 .282003.29|I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!]] saw him attain new-found popularity, Fashanu left the club; which by now was in a perilous financial state.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the club went into administration and the professional squad would quickly disintegrate. An interim management team was appointed, together with an amateur squad drawn primarily from local side N & M Construction of the [[South Wales Amateur League]] (five levels below the Welsh Premier). Within a month, Barry had gone from winning a match in Europe to losing 8\u20130 at [[Caernarfon Town]]. Though the professional-era bubble had well and truly burst, fans set about raising money to help keep the club alive. Eventually, mystery man Stuart Lovering arrived to purchase of the club on 10 December 2003. Few could have foreseen what was to come.\n\n[[2003\u201304 Welsh Premier League|2003\u201304]] was a difficult season, with champions Barry's first league win not coming until February 2004 when they beat fellow strugglers [[Welshpool Town F.C.|Welshpool Town]] 5\u20134 with a 98th-minute winning penalty from youngster Luke Sherbon. Manager [[Colin Addison]] was brought in resuscitate the team's ailing fortunes, yet the Dragons still ended up bottom of the division, four points off safety, and were relegated to the [[Welsh Football League Division One|Welsh League Division One]]. Controversially, Addison was dismissed by Lovering on the eve of the new campaign, with assistant [[David Hughes (footballer born 1978)|David Hughes]] replacing him; only to leave himself months later on finding his budget slashed. In the meantime, an independent [[Valuation Office Agency|district valuer]] had determined that the club should pay \u00a342,000 in rent and rates each season for the remainder of the lease. Judging the figure to be unfairly based on the club's relinquished professional status, Lovering refused to pay this amount and instead moved the senior side to the White Tips Stadium in [[Treforest]] from January 2005 to May 2006. During the absence, a number of staunch supporters formed breakaway club '''Barry FC'''; the culmination of a series of disputes with chairman Lovering, who had banned them from fundraising at club. With the Town relegated to their lowest-ever league status at the end of the [[2005\u201306 in Welsh football|2005\u201306]] season, the future appeared bleak for this fallen giant of Welsh football.\n\n===Fan-led fightback===\nWhile chaos reigned off the field for much of the decade, the roots of recovery began to grow in 2007, with the appointment of new manager Gavin Chesterfield. Chesterfield led Barry to promotion in 2008, with the hope that a winning run of form in the second tier would see the club's dwindling support return. After stumbling early on, Barry enjoyed a 21-match unbeaten streak and finished the season a credible third. Nevertheless, the team's achievements were continually overshadowed by events behind the scenes.\n\nIn December 2008, a crisis meeting at Jenner Park saw supporters come forward to pledge their commitment to operating the first team (forming a new company for this purpose), to allow Lovering to focus on finding a buyer. In one of a number of close calls, the club appeared on the verge of being sold in 2010, when businessman Clayton Jones appeared to strike a deal. However, this fell through at the eleventh hour, scuppering a plan to bring in [[Wales]] international [[John Hartson]] as [[Director of Football]].\n\nUndeterred, 2010 saw the '''Stand Up For Barry''' campaign launch, utilising new [[social media]] platforms such as [[Twitter]] to spread news of the club's plight with a wider online audience. The resulting support from across the football community proved an invaluable asset as supporters strived to keep the club alive.\n\nShortly after the close of the 2010\u201311 season, Lovering announced his fresh intent of withdrawing the first team from higher league competition. To prevent this, the '''Barry Town Supporters' Committee''' (BTSC) took complete control of all football and its funding; resulting in what became known to some supporters as the 'DIY Football' era. In the months that followed, the rejuvenated, fan-run Barry set-up enjoyed their most successful [[Welsh Cup]] campaign in several seasons; defeating rivals [[Merthyr Town]] at [[Penydarren Park]] and winning at [[Haverfordwest County]] in extra-time, before being edged out 3\u20132 at [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]].\n\n[[File:Barry fans and players celebrate 2013 Welsh Cup success in Flint.jpg|thumb|left|A TV cameraman records Barry fans and players celebrating after their Welsh Cup Quarter Final win at [[Flint Town United]] on 2 March 2013.]]\n\n2012 marked the 100th anniversary of the club's [[wikt:formation|formation]], with a series of events lined up to mark this and the subsequent centenary season. To launch the festivities, the BTSC hosted [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in an August fundraising friendly attended by 2,000 spectators. However, Lovering's threats to withdraw Barry from the [[Welsh Football League]] would intensify in the weeks prior, threatening to cast a cloud over these celebrations. Nevertheless, the BTSC held a successful '100 Years of Barry Town' event at the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] (attended by many past and present players), before the current team beat Welsh League champions [[Cambrian & Clydach Vale B. & G.C.|Cambrian and Clydach]] on the 100th anniversary itself.\n\nIn March 2013, following wins against [[Caerleon FC|Caerleon]], [[Penrhyncoch F.C.|Penrhyncoch]], [[Ely Rangers]] and [[Pontardawe Town F.C.|Pontardawe Town]], Barry won 2\u20130 at [[Flint Town United]] to progress to the [[2012\u201313 Welsh Cup|Welsh Cup]] semi-final for the first time in a decade. Eventually, the team narrowly lost 1\u20132 to eventual winners [[Prestatyn Town]], marking the first ever appearance of a fully amateur Barry side at the Welsh Cup semi-final stage.\n\n===Survival and resurgence===\nOn 7 May 2013, Lovering withdrew the senior team from the [[Welsh Football League]], against the will of the BTSC, players and supporters; who were ready, willing and able to fulfill the remaining two league fixtures (both against [[Ton Pentre FC|Ton Pentre]]). Rejecting this perceived act of sabotage, those running the football outlined their intentions to continue as they were, adopting the '''Barry Town United''' suffix to emphasise their continuing unity and endeavour. However, a meeting of the [[Football Association of Wales|FAW]] Council in [[Betws-y-Coed]] in June 2013 announced that the Barry side would have to play \"recreational football\" henceforth; a declaration that prompted significant outcry, both locally and further afield.\n[[File:Maesmawr Hall, Caersws.jpg|thumb|Barry at [[Maesmawr Hall]] before [[Welsh Cup]] Semi-final in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]].]]\nThere appeared hope for beleaguered Barry as second meeting was arranged for July 2013 at [[Maesmawr Hall]] in [[Caersws]] to hear new evidence as why the team should be able to continue on. At this second gathering, 15 of the FAW Councillors voted against discussing Barry's future, thus concluding the meeting in no more than five minutes and at considerable expense. Notably, it emerged that this decision went against the recommendations of the FAW's own Domestic Committee and legal team.\n\nWith their immediate and long-term future unclear, Barry began their pre-season with wins at [[Moreton-in-Marsh|Moreton]] and [[Elmore, Gloucestershire|Elmore]] that same month, followed by a narrow 3\u20132 loss to [[Premier League]] newcomers [[Cardiff City]], watched by a home crowd of 1,650 supporters on Saturday 27 July. Remarkably, given the bizarre set of circumstances, Barry had led 2\u20131 at half-time.\n\nEventually, a [[High Court]] judge in Cardiff ruled in Barry's favour; stating that the FAW Council had acted unlawfully in denying them their licence to play Welsh League football. As a result, the fan-run Town side was entered back into the structure.\n\nIn the years that have followed, Barry would win two consecutive league titles, reclaiming their place in the second tier, while continuing to develop as a club, on and off the pitch. Today, the club competes at senior, development, youth and junior levels, along with various ladies' teams and pan disability sides in the over and under-16 age groups. In the 2016\u201317 season, the first team reached the final of [[Welsh League Cup]] for the first time since 2001, becoming only the second side from outside the national top flight to achieve this feat since the competition was expanded several years prior. In April 2017, the club secured its return to the [[Cymru Premier|Welsh Premier]] as champions of the [[Welsh Football League]], continuing this remarkable revival.\n\nOn Saturday 6 April 2019, a remarkable 5-2 victory away at Bala Town, coupled with a 6-0 win for The New Saints away against Newtown, ensured Barry Town United would finish at least third in the 2018-19 JD Cymru Premier and qualification for the preliminary round of the UEFA Europa League. This marked a remarkable transformation for the club, qualifying for European competition for the first time since winning the JD Cymru Premier in the 2002-03 season.\n\n==Colours==\nFor many decades, Barry wore green as their primary colour \u2013 thought to be due to officials securing the club's first kit from [[Plymouth Argyle]]. On exile in 1992, Barri adopted a red and white strip, which would remain with them on their return to the Welsh pyramid. It was the following season that the club adopted its yellow change kit (deemed lucky for the success it brought in [[Welsh Cup]] competition) as a home strip \u2013 and it is this colour that has become synonymous with Town football, with variations including uses of blue.\n\nTwo of the club's most memorable home strips are the [[fluorescent]] lime and navy ordered in error in 2006, and the experimental [[claret]] and blue kit worn in the early 1970s \u2013 both of which saw the club simultaneously plummet in footballing fortune. Nowadays, the club tends to wear yellow at home and green on the road.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _green_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripeonright\n| pattern_ra = _green_stripes\n| leftarm    = \n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = \n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Example of a traditional Linnets green strip, worn with longevity.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = \n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 3399FF\n| body       = 7F1734\n| rightarm   = 3399FF\n| shorts     = \n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 7F1734\n| alt        = \n| title      = Claret and blue strip, worn for a single disastrous season (1971\u201372).\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _vneckwhite\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 339933\n| body       = 339933\n| rightarm   = 339933\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| socks      = 339933\n| alt        = \n| title      = Green and blue strip, colour co-ordinated with Jenner Park seating.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FF0033\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FF0033\n| socks      = FF0033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Red and white strip, worn in exile and upon return to the Welsh pyramid.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _bluebuttoncollar\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = FFFF33\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = FFFF33\n| shorts     = FFFF33\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_blue\n| socks      = FFFF33\n| alt        = \n| title      = Welsh Cup Final strip of 1994, worn in famous win over [[Cardiff City]].\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = _yellowborder\n| pattern_b  = _collarblue\n| pattern_ra = _yellowborder\n| leftarm    = 3333CC\n| body       = FFFF33\n| rightarm   = 3333CC\n| shorts     = 3333CC\n| pattern_so = _color_3_stripes_yellow\n| socks      = 3333CC\n| alt        = \n| title      = League of Wales strip, adopted from cup kit, associated with 1990s success.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n| align      = \n| pattern_la = \n| pattern_b  = _Safasc_Away\n| pattern_ra = \n| leftarm    = 99FF00\n| body       = 99FF00\n| rightarm   = 99FF00\n| shorts     = 330033\n| pattern_so = \n| socks      = 330033\n| alt        = \n| title      = Fluorescent lime strip, worn in post-Millennium descent to lowest status.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Jenner Park Stadium}}\n\n[[File:Jenner Park - Barry.jpg|thumb|Jenner Park Stadium, Barry]]\n\n[[Jenner Park Stadium|Jenner Park]] occupies the space of land between Gladstone Road and Barry Road in central [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] and has been the setting for the evolution of Barry's senior football club for more than 100 years.\n\nNamed after the Jenner family who had gifted the land, the ground was built by the Barry football enthusiasts for their representative side to compete at the highest possible level and was completed between the landmark meeting of 1912 and the opening fixture of [[1913\u201314 in English football|1913\u201314]].\n\nAmong the most notable Barry matches played at Jenner Park have been European ties, domestic cup finals, major semi-finals and quarter-finals, [[FA Cup]] fixtures, televised matches, testimonials, high-scoring thrillers and friendlies against high-profile opposition.\n\nComprised initially of two wooden stands, popular bank terracing was added in 1923 and floodlights added in the [[1940s (decade)|1940s]], allowing Jenner Park to host Wales' first ever floodlit football match between Barry and [[Newport County FC|Newport]] in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]].\n\nDuring the [[1980s (decade)|1980s]], the local council rebuilt [[Jenner Park]], installing a synthetic running track, a new all-seater stand and improved floodlights.\n\nIn order to bring [[Jenner Park]] up to [[UEFA]] standards, a second covered stand was built in the mid [[1990s (decade)|1990s]], boosting the [[seating capacity]] to 2,500. This was temporarily increased to 6,000+ for the visits of [[Aberdeen FC|Aberdeen]] and [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] with the use of temporary [[bleachers]].\n\nRecent years have seen the addition of a special viewing area for wheelchair users in the grandstand (known colloquially as the 'Old Stand'), accessible via the stadium's Devon Avenue entrance. Meanwhile, October 2015 saw work completed on a new, state-of-the-art [[3G pitch]], with its inaugural game, a [[Welsh Cup]] match against [[Aberdare Town F.C.|Aberdare Town]].\n\n==Current squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1 |pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Mike Lewis|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=2 |pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Paul Morgan|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=3|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Chris Hugh|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=4|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cooper|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=5|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Curtis Watkins|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=6|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Robbie Patten|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=7|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Kayne McLaggon]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=8|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Troy Greening|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=9|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Eli Phipps|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=10|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Jordan Cotterill|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=11|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=Drew Fahiya|other=}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=12|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Luke Cummings|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=14|pos=FW|nat=WAL|name=[[Jack Compton]]|other=}}\n{{fs_player|no=15|pos=MF|nat=SKN|name=[[Theo Wharton]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=16|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Jonathan Hood|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=17|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Keyon Reffell|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=24|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Callum Sainty|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=25|pos=GK|nat=WAL|name=Joe Baker|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=26|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=Lewis Cosslett| (loaned)|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=29|pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=Clayton Green|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=33|pos=DF|nat=WAL|name=[[Evan Press]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=39  |pos=MF|nat=WAL|name=[[David Cotterill]]|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n\n===Technical staff===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was enthroned when the city was at the height of its influence and power within the [[Roman Empire]]. Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the [[Christological controversies]] of the late-4th and 5th centuries. He was a central figure in the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431, which led to the deposition of [[Nestorius]] as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nCyril is counted among the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[Doctors of the Church]], and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles ''Pillar of Faith'' and ''Seal of all the Fathers'', but [[Theodosius II]], the [[Roman Emperor]], condemned him for behaving like a \"proud pharaoh\", and the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] bishops at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] declared him a heretic, labelling him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church.\"<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47.</ref>\n\nCyril is well known for his dispute with Nestorius and his supporter Patriarch [[John of Antioch]], whom Cyril excluded from the Council of Ephesus for arriving late. He is also known for his expulsion of [[Novatianism|Novatians]] and Jews from Alexandria and for inflaming tensions that led to the murder of the [[hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosopher]] [[Hypatia]] by a Christian mob. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility in this.\n\nCyrillus placed the pious Christian emperor Theodosius II (AD 408-450) to his debt by dedicating his Paschal table of 114 years to him.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 193-194</ref> What is also historically important is that Cyrillus\u2019 Paschal table was provided with a [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] basic structure in the form of a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle adopted by him around AD 425, which was very different from the original similar lunar cycle invented around AD 260 by [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], but exactly equal to the similar lunar cycle introduced around AD 412 by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]]: the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] equivalent of this lunar cycle adopted by Cyrillus would, only a century later, emerge in Rome as the basic structure of [[Dionysius Exiguus]]\u2019 Paschal table (AD 525) and, only two more centuries later, emerge in England as the one of [[Bede]]\u2019s Easter table (AD 725).<ref>Zuidhoek (2019) 67-73</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. This date is used by the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]]. Yet the 1969 Catholic Calendar revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice, 1969), pp. 95 and 116.</ref> The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Catholic|Catholic]] Churches celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria]], on 18 January.\n\n==Early life==\nLittle is known for certain of Cyril's early life. He was born {{circa}}&nbsp;376, in the small town of Didouseya, Egypt, modern-day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Norman Russell|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EmeFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=didouseya#v=onepage&q=didouseya&f=false|title=Cyril of Alexandria: The Early Church Fathers|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=204|isbn=9781134673377}}</ref> A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] rose to the powerful position of [[Patriarch of Alexandria]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ.

His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]. He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390\u2013392),<ref name=\"st-takla.org\">https://st-takla.org/Saints/Coptic-Orthodox-Saints-Biography/Coptic-Saints-Story_1492.html</ref> rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393\u2013397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398\u2013402).<ref name=\"st-takla.org\"/>\n\nIn 403 he accompanied his uncle to attend the \"[[Synod of the Oak]]\" in Constantinople,<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.11.xvii.htm Schaff, Philip. \"Cyril of Alexandria\"], ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. III.</ref> which deposed [[John Chrysostom]] as Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-cyril-of-alexandria/ \"Saint Cyril of Alexandria\", Franciscan Media]</ref> The prior year, Theophilus had been summoned by the emperor to [[Constantinople]] to apologize before a [[synod]], over which Chrysostom would preside, on account of several charges which were brought against him by certain Egyptian monks. Theophilus had them persecuted as [[Origen of Alexandria|Origenists]].<ref>[[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], ''Dialogus'', xvi; [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VI, 7; [[Sozomen]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VIII, 12.</ref> Placing himself at the head of soldiers and armed servants Theophilus had marched against the monks, burned their dwellings, and ill-treated those whom he captured.<ref>Chrysostom Baur (1912), [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14625b.htm \"Theophilus], ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Vol. XIV (New York: Robert Appleton Company)</ref> Theophilus arrived at Constantinople with twenty-nine of his suffragan bishops, and conferring with those opposed to the Archbishop, drafted a long list of largely unfounded accusations against Chrysostom,<ref>[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', 59, in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', CIII, 105-113</ref> who refused to recognize the legality of a synod in which his open enemies were judges. Chrysostom was subsequently deposed.\n\n===Patriarch of Alexandria===\nTheophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope (word)|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, but only after a riot between his supporters and those of his rival Archdeacon Timotheus. According to [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], the Alexandrians were always rioting.<ref name=Chapman>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04592b.htm Chapman, John. \"St. Cyril of Alexandria.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 June 2016</ref>\n\nThus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants.<ref name=\"library\">Preston Chesser, {{cite web | title=The Burning of the Library of Alexandria | url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=9}}, eHistory.com</ref> He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatianism|Novatianists]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.\n\n==Controversies==\n====Dispute with the Prefect====\n[[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}}\n\nTension between the parties increased when in 415, Orestes published an edict that outlined new regulations regarding mime shows and dancing exhibitions in the city, which attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees. Crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater. Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to discover the content of the edict. The edict angered Christians as well as Jews. At one such gathering, Hierax read the edict and applauded the new regulations, prompting a disturbance. Many people felt that Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd into sedition.<ref>John of Nikiu, 84.92.</ref> Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: one to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13.6-9</ref>{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}}\n\nSocrates Scholasticus recounts that upon hearing of Hierex's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with \"the utmost severities\" if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately. In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians. They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire. When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, \"the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them\" by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight. When the morning came, Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city's synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre.<ref name=Scholasticus>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', born after 380 AD, died after 439 AD.</ref>\n\nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus, after Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria. Scholasticus indicates that all the Jews were banished, while [[John of Niki\u00fb]] says only those involved in the ambush. Susan Wessel says that, while it is not clear whether Scholasticus was a Novationist (whose churches Cyril had closed), he was apparently sympathetic towards them, and makes clear Cyril's habit of abusing his episcopal power by infringing on the rights and duties of the secular authorities. Wessel says \"...Socrates probably does not provide accurate and unambiguous information about Cyril's relationship to imperial authority\".{{sfn|Wessel p. 22}}\n\nNonetheless, with Cyril's banishment of the Jews, however many, \"Orestes [...] was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population.\"<ref name=Scholasticus /> Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation. Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, showed him the Gospels, which he interpreted to indicate that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy.<ref name=\"wessel35\">Wessel, p. 35</ref> Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures.\n\nThis refusal almost cost Orestes his life. [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks had resorted to violence 15 years before, during a controversy between Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) and the \"[[Tall Brothers]]\"; the monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. A monk named [[Ammonius (Alexandrian monk)|Ammonius]] threw a stone hitting Orestes in the head. The prefect had Ammonius tortured to death, whereupon the Patriarch honored him as a martyr. However, according to Scholasticus, the Christian community displayed a general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom. The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], as did Cyril.<ref name=\"ss7_14\">Socrates Scholasticus, vii.14.</ref><ref>Wessel, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n====Murder of Hypatia====\n{{Main|Hypatia}}\nThe Prefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable [[moral authority]] in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. At the time of her death, she was probably over sixty years of age. Indeed, many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all conciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, in order to better manage the tumultuous political life of the Egyptian capital.<ref>Christopher Haas, ''Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict'', JHU Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8018-8541-8}}, p. 312.</ref> A mob, led by a [[lector]] named Peter, took Hypatia from her chariot and murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.<ref name=\"ss7_15\">Socrate Scolastico, vii.15.</ref><ref>Giovanni di Nikiu, 84.88-100.</ref>\n\nNeoplatonist historian [[Damascius]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;458 \u2013 {{circa}}&nbsp;538) was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/issues/v06n1/4whitfield.pdf |title=Whitfield, Bryan J., \"The Beauty of Reasoning: A Reexamination of Hypatia and Alexandria\", ''The Mathematics Educator'', vol. 6, issue 1, p.14, University of Georgia, Summer 1995 |access-date=14 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902110939/http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/Issues/v06n1/4whitfield.pdf |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril.{{sfn|Dzielska|1996|p=18}} Some modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril.<ref>[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Hypatia of Alexandria'', Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1995 (Revealing Antiquity, 8), p. xi, 157. {{ISBN|0-674-43775-6}}</ref> According to lexicographer [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], \"She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911232203/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Scholasticus writes that Hypatia ultimately fell \"victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed\". News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denunciation, not only of Cyril but of the whole Alexandrian Christian community.\n\n====Conflict with Nestorius====\nAnother major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the [[First Council of Constantinople#Dispute concerning the third canon|third canon of the First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>Leo Donald Davis, ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology'', Collegeville (Min.): The Liturgical Press, 1983, pp. 136-148. {{ISBN|0-8146-5616-1}}</ref>\n\nCyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the \"Mother of God\" (''[[Theotokos]]''). As the term \"Mother of God\" had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a \"Mother of Man\" nor \"[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]\" as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the \"Mother of Christ\" (Greek: ''[[Christotokos]]''). Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his \"temple\" (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered \"in the flesh.\"<ref>Thomas Gerard Weinandy, Daniel A. Keating, ''The theology of St. Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York: T&T Clark Ltd, 2003, p. 49.</ref> However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh.<ref>Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril {{cite web|url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065600/https://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus<ref name=\"st-takla.org\"/> as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary. The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy.\n\nHowever, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47.</ref> Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \nCyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|\"Robber Synod\" of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond.\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Icon St. Cyril of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Icon of St. Cyril of Alexandria]]\nCyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers. [[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was ''[[Theotokos]]'', meaning \"God bearer\", which became in Latin \"Mater Dei or Dei Genetrix\", or Mother of God), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct \"Jesus the man\" and \"the divine [[Logos]]\" in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomy|dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.\n\nThe main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril affirmed that the Holy Trinity consists of a singular divine nature, essence, and being (''ousia'') in three distinct aspects, instantiations, or subsistencies of being (''hypostases''). These distinct hypostases are the Father or God in Himself, the Son or Word (''Logos''), and the Holy Spirit. Then, when the Son became flesh and entered the world, the pre-Incarnate divine nature and assumed human nature both remained, but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus. This resulted in the [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] slogan \"One Nature united out of two\" being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.  \n \nAccording to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son of God: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. The Logos Incarnate suffered and died on the Cross, and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril passionately argued for the continuity of a single subject, God the Word, from the pre-Incarnate state to the Incarnate state. The divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world\u2014not merely bestowed upon, semantically affixed to, or morally associated with the man Jesus, as the [[adoptionism|adoptionists]] and, he believed, Nestorius had taught.\n\n===Mariology===\nCyril of Alexandria became noted in [[Church history]] because of his spirited fight for the title \"[[Theotokos]]<ref>[https://independent.academia.edu/EIRINIARTEMINationalandCapodistrianUniversityofAthens/Papers/1721697/The_rejection_of_the_term_Theotokos_by_Nestorius_Constantinople The rejection of the term Theotokos by Nestorius Constantinople]</ref>\" during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431).\n\nHis writings include the homily given in Ephesus  and several other sermons.<ref>PG 76,992, ''Adv. Nolentes confiteri Sanctam Virginem esse Deiparem'', PG 76, 259.</ref> Some of his alleged homilies are in dispute as to his authorship. In several writings, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus to his mother. On the [[Cross]], he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in [[Cana]], he bows to her wishes. Cyril created the basis for all other [[mariology|mariological]] developments through his teaching of the blessed Virgin Mary, as the \"[[Mother of God]].\"<ref name=\"HarperOne\">{{cite book|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Justo L.|title=The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York|isbn=9780060633158|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz/page/254 254]}}</ref> The conflict with Nestorius was mainly over this issue, and it has often been misunderstood. \"[T]he debate was not so much about Mary as about Jesus.

In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegetical documents.

Preface to the online edition]</ref> and ''Dialogues on the [[Trinity]]''. In 429 as the Christological controversies increased, the output of his writings was so extensive that his opponents could not match it.

Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility in this.\n\nCyrillus placed the pious Christian emperor Theodosius II (AD 408-450) to his debt by dedicating his Paschal table of 114 years to him.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 193-194</ref> What is also historically important is that Cyrillus\u2019 Paschal table was provided with a [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] basic structure in the form of a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle adopted by him around AD 425, which was very different from the original similar lunar cycle invented around AD 260 by [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], but exactly equal to the similar lunar cycle introduced around AD 412 by [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]]: the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] equivalent of this lunar cycle adopted by Cyrillus would, only a century later, emerge in Rome as the basic structure of [[Dionysius Exiguus]]\u2019 Paschal table (AD 525) and, only two more centuries later, in England as the one of [[Bede]]\u2019s Easter table (AD 725).<ref>Zuidhoek (2019) 67-73</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. This date is used by the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]].

His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]. He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390\u2013392),<ref name=\"st-takla.org\">https://st-takla.org/Saints/Coptic-Orthodox-Saints-Biography/Coptic-Saints-Story_1492.html</ref> rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393\u2013397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398\u2013402).<ref name=\"st-takla.org\"/>\n\nIn 403 he accompanied his uncle to attend the \"[[Synod of the Oak]]\" in Constantinople,<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc03/htm/ii.11.xvii.htm Schaff, Philip. \"Cyril of Alexandria\"], ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. III.</ref> which deposed [[John Chrysostom]] as Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-cyril-of-alexandria/ \"Saint Cyril of Alexandria\", Franciscan Media]</ref> The prior year, Theophilus had been summoned by the emperor to [[Constantinople]] to apologize before a [[synod]], over which Chrysostom would preside, on account of several charges which were brought against him by certain Egyptian monks. Theophilus had them persecuted as [[Origen of Alexandria|Origenists]].<ref>[[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], ''Dialogus'', xvi; [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VI, 7; [[Sozomen]], ''Ecclesiastical History'', VIII, 12.</ref> Placing himself at the head of soldiers and armed servants Theophilus had marched against the monks, burned their dwellings, and ill-treated those whom he captured.<ref>Chrysostom Baur (1912), [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14625b.htm \"Theophilus], ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Vol. XIV (New York: Robert Appleton Company)</ref> Theophilus arrived at Constantinople with twenty-nine of his suffragan bishops, and conferring with those opposed to the Archbishop, drafted a long list of largely unfounded accusations against Chrysostom,<ref>[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', 59, in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graecae]]'', CIII, 105-113</ref> who refused to recognize the legality of a synod in which his open enemies were judges. Chrysostom was subsequently deposed.\n\n===Patriarch of Alexandria===\nTheophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope (word)|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, but only after a riot between his supporters and those of his rival Archdeacon Timotheus. According to [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]], the Alexandrians were always rioting.<ref name=Chapman>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04592b.htm Chapman, John. \"St. Cyril of Alexandria.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 14 June 2016</ref>\n\nThus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants.<ref name=\"library\">Preston Chesser, {{cite web | title=The Burning of the Library of Alexandria | url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=9}}, eHistory.com</ref> He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatianism|Novatianists]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.\n\n==Controversies==\n====Dispute with the Prefect====\n[[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}}\n\nTension between the parties increased when in 415, Orestes published an edict that outlined new regulations regarding mime shows and dancing exhibitions in the city, which attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees. Crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater. Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to discover the content of the edict. The edict angered Christians as well as Jews. At one such gathering, Hierax read the edict and applauded the new regulations, prompting a disturbance. Many people felt that Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd into sedition.<ref>John of Nikiu, 84.92.</ref> Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: one to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13.6-9</ref>{{sfn|Wessel, p. 34}}\n\nSocrates Scholasticus recounts that upon hearing of Hierex's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with \"the utmost severities\" if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately. In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians. They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire. When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, \"the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them\" by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight. When the morning came, Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city's synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre.<ref name=Scholasticus>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', born after 380 AD, died after 439 AD.</ref>\n\nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus, after Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria. Scholasticus indicates that all the Jews were banished, while [[John of Niki\u00fb]] says only those involved in the ambush. Susan Wessel says that, while it is not clear whether Scholasticus was a Novationist (whose churches Cyril had closed), he was apparently sympathetic towards them, and makes clear Cyril's habit of abusing his episcopal power by infringing on the rights and duties of the secular authorities. Wessel says \"...Socrates probably does not provide accurate and unambiguous information about Cyril's relationship to imperial authority\".{{sfn|Wessel p. 22}}\n\nNonetheless, with Cyril's banishment of the Jews, however many, \"Orestes [...] was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population.\"<ref name=Scholasticus /> Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation. Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, showed him the Gospels, which he interpreted to indicate that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy.<ref name=\"wessel35\">Wessel, p. 35</ref> Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures.\n\nThis refusal almost cost Orestes his life. [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks had resorted to violence 15 years before, during a controversy between Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) and the \"[[Tall Brothers]]\"; the monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. A monk named [[Ammonius (Alexandrian monk)|Ammonius]] threw a stone hitting Orestes in the head. The prefect had Ammonius tortured to death, whereupon the Patriarch honored him as a martyr. However, according to Scholasticus, the Christian community displayed a general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom. The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], as did Cyril.<ref name=\"ss7_14\">Socrates Scholasticus, vii.14.</ref><ref>Wessel, pp. 35-36.</ref>\n\n====Murder of Hypatia====\n{{Main|Hypatia}}\nThe Prefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable [[moral authority]] in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. At the time of her death, she was probably over sixty years of age. Indeed, many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all conciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, in order to better manage the tumultuous political life of the Egyptian capital.<ref>Christopher Haas, ''Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict'', JHU Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8018-8541-8}}, p. 312.</ref> A mob, led by a [[lector]] named Peter, took Hypatia from her chariot and murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.<ref name=\"ss7_15\">Socrate Scolastico, vii.15.</ref><ref>Giovanni di Nikiu, 84.88-100.</ref>\n\nNeoplatonist historian [[Damascius]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;458 \u2013 {{circa}}&nbsp;538) was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/issues/v06n1/4whitfield.pdf |title=Whitfield, Bryan J., \"The Beauty of Reasoning: A Reexamination of Hypatia and Alexandria\", ''The Mathematics Educator'', vol. 6, issue 1, p.14, University of Georgia, Summer 1995 |access-date=14 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902110939/http://math.coe.uga.edu/tme/Issues/v06n1/4whitfield.pdf |archive-date=2 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril.{{sfn|Dzielska|1996|p=18}} Some modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril.<ref>[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Hypatia of Alexandria'', Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1995 (Revealing Antiquity, 8), p. xi, 157. {{ISBN|0-674-43775-6}}</ref> According to lexicographer [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], \"She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911232203/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html |archive-date=11 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Scholasticus writes that Hypatia ultimately fell \"victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed\". News of Hypatia's murder provoked great public denunciation, not only of Cyril but of the whole Alexandrian Christian community.\n\n====Conflict with Nestorius====\nAnother major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the [[First Council of Constantinople#Dispute concerning the third canon|third canon of the First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>Leo Donald Davis, ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology'', Collegeville (Min.): The Liturgical Press, 1983, pp. 136-148. {{ISBN|0-8146-5616-1}}</ref>\n\nCyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the \"Mother of God\" (''[[Theotokos]]''). As the term \"Mother of God\" had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a \"Mother of Man\" nor \"[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]\" as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the \"Mother of Christ\" (Greek: ''[[Christotokos]]''). Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his \"temple\" (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered \"in the flesh.\"<ref>Thomas Gerard Weinandy, Daniel A. Keating, ''The theology of St. Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York: T&T Clark Ltd, 2003, p. 49.</ref> However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh.<ref>Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril {{cite web|url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607065600/https://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus<ref name=\"st-takla.org\"/> as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary. The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy.\n\nHowever, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47.</ref> Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> \nCyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|\"Robber Synod\" of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond.\n\n==Theology==\n[[File:Icon St. Cyril of Alexandria.jpg|thumb|Icon of St. Cyril of Alexandria]]\nCyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (Christianity)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers. [[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was ''[[Theotokos]]'', meaning \"God bearer\", which became in Latin \"Mater Dei or Dei Genetrix\", or Mother of God), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct \"Jesus the man\" and \"the divine [[Logos]]\" in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomy|dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.\n\nThe main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril affirmed that the Holy Trinity consists of a singular divine nature, essence, and being (''ousia'') in three distinct aspects, instantiations, or subsistencies of being (''hypostases''). These distinct hypostases are the Father or God in Himself, the Son or Word (''Logos''), and the Holy Spirit. Then, when the Son became flesh and entered the world, the pre-Incarnate divine nature and assumed human nature both remained, but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus. This resulted in the [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] slogan \"One Nature united out of two\" being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.  \n \nAccording to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son of God: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. The Logos Incarnate suffered and died on the Cross, and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril passionately argued for the continuity of a single subject, God the Word, from the pre-Incarnate state to the Incarnate state. The divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world\u2014not merely bestowed upon, semantically affixed to, or morally associated with the man Jesus, as the [[adoptionism|adoptionists]] and, he believed, Nestorius had taught.\n\n===Mariology===\nCyril of Alexandria became noted in [[Church history]] because of his spirited fight for the title \"[[Theotokos]]<ref>[https://independent.academia.edu/EIRINIARTEMINationalandCapodistrianUniversityofAthens/Papers/1721697/The_rejection_of_the_term_Theotokos_by_Nestorius_Constantinople The rejection of the term Theotokos by Nestorius Constantinople]</ref>\" during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431).\n\nHis writings include the homily given in Ephesus  and several other sermons.<ref>PG 76,992, ''Adv. Nolentes confiteri Sanctam Virginem esse Deiparem'', PG 76, 259.</ref> Some of his alleged homilies are in dispute as to his authorship. In several writings, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus to his mother. On the [[Cross]], he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in [[Cana]], he bows to her wishes. Cyril created the basis for all other [[mariology|mariological]] developments through his teaching of the blessed Virgin Mary, as the \"[[Mother of God]].\"<ref name=\"HarperOne\">{{cite book|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Justo L.|title=The Story of Christianity, Volume 1: The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York|isbn=9780060633158|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz/page/254 254]}}</ref> The conflict with Nestorius was mainly over this issue, and it has often been misunderstood. \"[T]he debate was not so much about Mary as about Jesus.

In 429 as the Christological controversies increased, the output of his writings was so extensive that his opponents could not match it.
