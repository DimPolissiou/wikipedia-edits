''Microraptor'' had long [[pennaceous feather]]s that formed aerodynamic surfaces on the arms and tail but also on the legs. This led paleontologist [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] in 2003 to describe the first specimen to preserve this feature as a \"four-winged dinosaur\" and to speculate that it may have [[Gliding flight|glided]] using all four limbs for lift. Subsequent studies have suggested that ''Microraptor'' was capable of powered flight as well.\n\n''Microraptor'' was among the most abundant non-[[Avialae|avialan]] dinosaurs in its ecosystem, and the genus is represented by more fossils than any other dromaeosaurid, with possibly over 300 fossil specimens represented across various museum collections.<ref name=alexanderetal2010/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Microraptor scale.png|thumb|left|Wingspan and body size compared with a human]]\nWith adult specimens estimated up to {{convert|77|cm|ft|disp=x| long (}}) and with a weight estimated up to {{convert|1|kg}}, ''Microraptor'' was among the [[Dinosaur size|smallest-known non-avian dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\"/> Holtz estimated it at {{convert|90|cm|ft}}.<ref name=\"Holtz2008\">Holtz, Thomas R.

Seven specimens of ''M. zhaoianus'' have been described in detail, from which most feather impressions are known. Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, ''Microraptor'' is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu ''et al.'' (2003) compared the longer plumes on ''Microraptor''{{'}}s head to those of the [[Philippine eagle]].

''Microraptor'' is particularly similar to the basal troodontid ''[[Sinovenator]]''; in their 2002 description of two ''M. zhaoianus'' specimens, Hwang ''et al.'' note that this is not particularly surprising, given that both ''Microraptor'' and ''Sinovenator'' are very primitive members of two closely related groups, and both are close to the [[Dromaeosauridae|deinonychosaurian]] split between dromaeosaurids and troodontids.<ref name=\"hwangetal2002\">Hwang, S.H., Norell, M.A., Ji, Q., and Gao, K.

By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with [[scanning electron microscope]] techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In ''Microraptor'', these cells were shaped in a manner consistent with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern [[Common starling|starling]], and indicated [[iridescence]] in the plumage of ''Microraptor''.

The long feathers on the legs of ''Microraptor'' were true flight feathers as seen in modern [[bird]]s, with asymmetrical vanes on the arm, leg, and tail feathers. As in modern bird wings, ''Microraptor'' had both primary (anchored to the hand) and secondary (anchored to the arm) flight feathers. This standard wing pattern was mirrored on the hindlegs, with [[flight feather]]s anchored to the upper foot bones as well as the upper and lower leg. Though not apparent in most fossils under natural light, due to obstruction from decayed soft tissue, the feather bases extended close to or in contact with the bones, as in modern birds, providing strong anchor points.<ref name=hone2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Hone | first1 = D.W.E. | last2 = Tischlinger | first2 = H. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | year = 2010 | title = The extent of the preserved feathers on the four-winged dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' under ultraviolet light | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 2| page = e9223 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009223 | pmid=20169153 | pmc=2821398 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9223H }}</ref>\n\nIt was originally thought that ''Microraptor'' was a [[Gliding flight|glider]], and probably lived mainly in trees, because the hindwings anchored to the feet of ''Microraptor'' would have hindered their ability to run on the ground.<ref name=\"Xuetal2003\">Xu, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Kuang, X., Zhang, F. and Du, X.

He noted that the ''Microraptor's'' fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that ''Microraptor'' had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the [[vertebra]]l column until relatively advanced avialans like the [[enantiornithes]] appeared.<ref name=senter2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Senter | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontol.

This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a [[Patagium|propatagium]] linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an [[alula]], much like a \"thumb-like\" form of [[leading edge slot]], may indicate that ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight.<ref name=avianancestry>{{Cite journal|author1=Federico L.

Paul, and others have argued that the fact ''Microraptor'' could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid suggests that the [[Dromaeosauridae]], including later and larger species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'', were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of [[Gliding flight|gliding]], although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view.<ref name=\"Xuetal2003\"/><ref name=Turneretal07>{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Alan H. | last2 = Pol | first2 = Diego | last3 = Clarke | first3 = Julia A. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Gregory M. | last5 = Norell | first5 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = A basal dromaeosaurid and size evolution preceding avian flight | url = | journal = Science | volume = 317 | issue = 5843| pages = 1378\u20131381 | doi = 10.1126/science.1144066 | pmid = 17823350 | bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1378T }}</ref> Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them probably would not have been able to achieve enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings.

Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that ''Microraptor'' most likely employed a ''[[phugoid]]'' style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane [[wing]] structure, like those on the [[tibia]] and the [[tail]], could have been used to control drag and alter the [[Airway (aviation)|flight path]], [[trajectory]], etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer [[algorithm]]s that test [[Flying and gliding animals|animal flight]] capacity to test whether or not ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that ''Microraptor'' did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew, as opposed to gliding.<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = S. | last2 = Templin | first2 = R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 104 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u20131580 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 | pmid=17242354 | pmc=1780066| bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1576C }}</ref>\n\nSome paleontologists have doubted the biplane hypothesis, and have proposed other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander ''et al.'' described the construction of a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for ''Microraptor''.<ref name=alexanderetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Model tests of gliding with different hindwing configurations in the four-winged dromaeosaurid ''Microraptor gui'' | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107 | issue = 7| pages = 2972\u20132976 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0911852107 | pmid = 20133792 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.2972A | pmc = 2840342 }}</ref> A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on ''Microraptor'' and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for ''Microraptor''. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of ''Microraptor'' which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brusatte | first1 = Stephen L. | last2 = Brougham | first2 = Jason | year = 2010| title = Distorted ''Microraptor'' specimen is not ideal for understanding the origin of avian flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B| pmc = 2951411}}</ref> Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur ''[[Hesperonychus]]'', which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Reply to Brougham and Brusatte: Overall anatomy confirms posture and flight model offers insight into the evolution of bird flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B | pmc = 2951411 }}</ref>\n\n===Ground movement===\n[[File:Microraptor by durbed.jpg|thumb|Restoration of two individuals by the ground]]\nDue to the extent of the hindwings onto most of the animal's foot, many scientists have suggested that ''Microraptor'' would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered ''Microraptor'' when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the extreme length of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could ''Microraptor'' have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for ''Microraptor'' to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.<ref name=sullivanetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = C. | last2 = Hone | first2 = D.W.E. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | year = 2010 | title = The asymmetry of the carpal joint and the evolution of wing folding in maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 277 | issue = 1690| pages = 2027\u20132033 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.2281 | pmid = 20200032 | pmc = 2880093 }}</ref>\n\n===Implications===\n[[File:Tetrapteryx.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Beebe]]'s hypothetical \"''Tetrapteryx''\" with four wings, 1915]]\nThe unique wing arrangement found in ''Microraptor'' raised the question of whether the evolution of flight in modern birds went through a four-winged stage, or whether four-winged gliders like ''Microraptor'' were an evolutionary side-branch that left no descendants.

He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that ''Microraptor'' has modern bird features that make it more derived than ''Archaeopteryx''. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the [[Dromaeosauridae]] might actually be a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu ''et al.''

''Microraptor'' had long [[pennaceous feather]]s that formed aerodynamic surfaces on the arms and tail but also on the legs. This led paleontologist [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] in 2003 to describe the first specimen to preserve this feature as a \"four-winged dinosaur\" and to speculate that it may have [[Gliding flight|glided]] using all four limbs for lift. Subsequent studies have suggested that ''Microraptor'' was capable of powered flight as well.\n\n''Microraptor'' was among the most abundant non-[[Avialae|avialan]] dinosaurs in its ecosystem, and the genus is represented by more fossils than any other dromaeosaurid, with possibly over 300 fossil specimens represented across various museum collections.<ref name=alexanderetal2010/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Microraptor scale.png|thumb|left|Wingspan and body size compared with a human]]\nWith adult specimens estimated up to {{convert|77|cm|ft|disp=x| long (}}) and with a weight estimated up to {{convert|1|kg}}, ''Microraptor'' was among the [[Dinosaur size|smallest-known non-avian dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\"/> Holtz estimated it at {{convert|90|cm|ft}}.<ref name=\"Holtz2008\">Holtz, Thomas R.

Seven specimens of ''M. zhaoianus'' have been described in detail, from which most feather impressions are known. Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, ''Microraptor'' is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu ''et al.'' (2003) compared the longer plumes on ''Microraptor''{{'}}s head to those of the [[Philippine eagle]].

''Microraptor'' is particularly similar to the basal troodontid ''[[Sinovenator]]''; in their 2002 description of two ''M. zhaoianus'' specimens, Hwang ''et al.'' note that this is not particularly surprising, given that both ''Microraptor'' and ''Sinovenator'' are very primitive members of two closely related groups, and both are close to the [[Dromaeosauridae|deinonychosaurian]] split between dromaeosaurids and troodontids.<ref name=\"hwangetal2002\">Hwang, S.H., Norell, M.A., Ji, Q., and Gao, K.

By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with [[scanning electron microscope]] techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In ''Microraptor'', these cells were shaped in a manner consistent with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern [[Common starling|starling]], and indicated [[iridescence]] in the plumage of ''Microraptor''.

As in modern bird wings, ''Microraptor'' had both primary (anchored to the hand) and secondary (anchored to the arm) flight feathers. This standard wing pattern was mirrored on the hindlegs, with [[flight feather]]s anchored to the upper foot bones as well as the upper and lower leg.

He noted that the ''Microraptor's'' fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that ''Microraptor'' had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the [[vertebra]]l column until relatively advanced avialans like the [[enantiornithes]] appeared.<ref name=senter2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Senter | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontol.

This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a [[Patagium|propatagium]] linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an [[alula]], much like a \"thumb-like\" form of [[leading edge slot]], may indicate that ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight.<ref name=avianancestry>{{Cite journal|author1=Federico L.

Paul, and others have argued that the fact ''Microraptor'' could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid suggests that the [[Dromaeosauridae]], including later and larger species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'', were secondarily flightless.

Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that ''Microraptor'' most likely employed a ''[[phugoid]]'' style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane [[wing]] structure, like those on the [[tibia]] and the [[tail]], could have been used to control drag and alter the [[Airway (aviation)|flight path]], [[trajectory]], etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer [[algorithm]]s that test [[Flying and gliding animals|animal flight]] capacity to test whether or not ''Microraptor'' was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that ''Microraptor'' did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew, as opposed to gliding.<ref name=\"chatterjee2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = S. | last2 = Templin | first2 = R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Biplane wing planform and flight performance of the feathered dinosaur ''Microraptor gui'' | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0609975104v1.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 104 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u20131580 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0609975104 | pmid=17242354 | pmc=1780066| bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1576C }}</ref>\n\nSome paleontologists have doubted the biplane hypothesis, and have proposed other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander ''et al.'' described the construction of a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely.

Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of ''Microraptor'' which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brusatte | first1 = Stephen L. | last2 = Brougham | first2 = Jason | year = 2010| title = Distorted ''Microraptor'' specimen is not ideal for understanding the origin of avian flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B| pmc = 2951411}}</ref> Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur ''[[Hesperonychus]]'', which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Gong | first2 = E. | last3 = Martin | first3 = L.D. | last4 = Burnham | first4 = D.A. | last5 = Falk | first5 = A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Reply to Brougham and Brusatte: Overall anatomy confirms posture and flight model offers insight into the evolution of bird flight | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | volume = 107| issue = 40| pages = E155| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004977107 | pmid = 20864633 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107E.155B | pmc = 2951411 }}</ref>\n\n===Ground movement===\n[[File:Microraptor by durbed.jpg|thumb|Restoration of two individuals by the ground]]\nDue to the extent of the hindwings onto most of the animal's foot, many scientists have suggested that ''Microraptor'' would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered ''Microraptor'' when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the extreme length of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could ''Microraptor'' have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for ''Microraptor'' to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.<ref name=sullivanetal2010>{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = C. | last2 = Hone | first2 = D.W.E. | last3 = Xu | first3 = X. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = F. | year = 2010 | title = The asymmetry of the carpal joint and the evolution of wing folding in maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 277 | issue = 1690| pages = 2027\u20132033 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.2281 | pmid = 20200032 | pmc = 2880093 }}</ref>\n\n===Implications===\n[[File:Tetrapteryx.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Beebe]]'s hypothetical \"''Tetrapteryx''\" with four wings, 1915]]\nThe unique wing arrangement found in ''Microraptor'' raised the question of whether the evolution of flight in modern birds went through a four-winged stage, or whether four-winged gliders like ''Microraptor'' were an evolutionary side-branch that left no descendants.

The first of these specimens was discovered in 2001, and between 2001 and 2003 four more specimens were bought from private collectors by Xu's museum, the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]]. Xu also considered these specimens, most of which had hindwings and proportional differences from the original ''Microraptor'' specimen, to be a new species, which he named ''Microraptor gui''.

He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that ''Microraptor'' has modern bird features that make it more derived than ''Archaeopteryx''. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the [[Dromaeosauridae]] might actually be a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu ''et al.''

He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English [[English football league system|top-flight]] football (357 goals), and has also scored more [[hat-trick]]s (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nGreaves began his professional career at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1957, and played in the following year's [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club [[A.C. Milan]] for \u00a380,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a399,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1962 FA Cup Final|1961\u201362]] and [[1967 FA Cup Final|1966\u201367]], the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] in [[1962 FA Charity Shield|1962]] and [[1967 FA Charity Shield|1967]], and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1962\u201363]]; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962\u201363. He moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a player-exchange in March 1970 and retired the following year. After a four-year absence he returned to football at the non-league level, despite suffering from alcoholism. In a five-year spell he played for [[Brentwood Town F.C.|Brentwood]], [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and [[Woodford Town F.C.|Woodford Town]] before retiring for good in 1980. \n\nGreaves scored 13 goals in 12 [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He played in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup and lost his first team place to [[Geoff Hurst]], who kept Greaves out of the first team in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009.\n\nAfter retiring as a player Greaves went on to enjoy a successful career in broadcasting, most notably working alongside [[Ian St John]] on ''[[Saint and Greavsie]]'' from 1985 to 1992. During this period, he also made regular appearances on [[TV-am]]. He worked on a number of other sport programmes on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during this period, including ''[[Sporting Triangles]]'' (1987-1990).\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nGreaves was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]] and raised in [[Hainault, London|Hainault]].<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=29}}</ref> He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[James Thompson (footballer)|Jimmy Thompson]], and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (Drake's Ducklings were named after manager [[Ted Drake]] in response to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s \"[[Busby Babes]]\").<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach [[Dick Foss]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=34}}</ref> Greaves scored in the 1958 [[FA Youth Cup]] final, but Chelsea lost the [[two-legged tie]] 7\u20136 on aggregate after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.<ref name=\"yc58\">{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=35}}</ref> He turned professional in the summer of 1957, though spent eight weeks working at a steel company to supplement his income during the summer break.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\nAged 17, Greaves scored on his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut on 24 August 1957 against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1\u20131 draw at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Greaves|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=11 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812202321/http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html |archivedate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"sdp\">{{cite web|last1=Lanigan |first1=Adam |title=Sporting memories - Jimmy Greaves breaks the British transfer record |url=http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |publisher=The Sunday Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813120704/http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |archive-date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was an instant success, as the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' reported that he \"showed the ball control, confidence and positional strength of a seasoned campaigner\" and compared his debut to the instant impact the young [[Duncan Edwards]] had as a teenager.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=60}}</ref> The \"Blues\" played attacking football during the [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]] campaign, resulting in high-scoring matches, and Greaves ended the season as the club's top scorer with 22 goals in 37 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=62}}</ref> Drake rested him for six weeks from mid-November as he did not wish the praise Greaves was receiving to go to his head; Greaves marked his return to the first team at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] with four goals in a 7\u20134 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on Christmas Day.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=71}}</ref>\n\nGreaves scored five goals in a 6\u20132 win against league champions Wolverhampton Wanderers in the third match of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=102}}</ref> Chelsea remained inconsistent, though despite his team finishing in 14th place Greaves managed to finish as the division's top scorer with 32 goals in 44 league games.<ref name=\"sdp\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=107}}</ref> Greaves scored 29 goals in 40 league matches in the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] campaign, five of which came in a 5\u20134 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=155}}</ref> Despite his goalscoring exploits, the club could manage only an 18th-place finish, three places and three points above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1959-60|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1959-60.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Chelsea F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, Greaves scored [[hat-trick]]s against Wolves, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]; he scored four goals against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]; and hit five goals in a 7\u20131 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English [[English football league system|top-flight]] football (357 goals), and has also scored more [[hat-trick]]s (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nGreaves began his professional career at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1957, and played in the following year's [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club [[A.C. Milan]] for \u00a380,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a399,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1962 FA Cup Final|1961\u201362]] and [[1967 FA Cup Final|1966\u201367]], the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] in [[1962 FA Charity Shield|1962]] and [[1967 FA Charity Shield|1967]], and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1962\u201363]]; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962\u201363. He moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a player-exchange in March 1970 and retired the following year. After a four-year absence he returned to football at the non-league level, despite suffering from alcoholism. In a five-year spell he played for [[Brentwood Town F.C.|Brentwood]], [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and [[Woodford Town F.C.|Woodford Town]] before retiring for good in 1980. \n\nGreaves scored 13 goals in 12 [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He played in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup and lost his first team place to [[Geoff Hurst]], who kept Greaves out of the first team in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009.\n\nAfter retiring as a player Greaves went on to enjoy a successful career in broadcasting, most notably working alongside [[Ian St John]] on ''[[Saint and Greavsie]]'' from 1985 to 1992. During this period, he also made regular appearances on [[TV-am]]. He worked on a number of other sport programmes on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during this period, including ''[[Sporting Triangles]]'' (1987-1990).\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nGreaves was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]] and raised in [[Hainault, London|Hainault]].<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=29}}</ref> He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[James Thompson (footballer)|Jimmy Thompson]], and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (Drake's Ducklings were named after manager [[Ted Drake]] in response to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s \"[[Busby Babes]]\").<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach [[Dick Foss]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=34}}</ref> Greaves scored in the 1958 [[FA Youth Cup]] final, but Chelsea lost the [[two-legged tie]] 7\u20136 on aggregate after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.<ref name=\"yc58\">{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=35}}</ref> He turned professional in the summer of 1957, though spent eight weeks working at a steel company to supplement his income during the summer break.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\nAged 17, Greaves scored on his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut on 24 August 1957 against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1\u20131 draw at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Greaves|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=11 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812202321/http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html |archivedate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"sdp\">{{cite web|last1=Lanigan |first1=Adam |title=Sporting memories - Jimmy Greaves breaks the British transfer record |url=http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |publisher=The Sunday Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813120704/http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |archive-date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was an instant success, as the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' reported that he \"showed the ball control, confidence and positional strength of a seasoned campaigner\" and compared his debut to the instant impact the young [[Duncan Edwards]] had as a teenager.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=60}}</ref> The \"Blues\" played attacking football during the [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]] campaign, resulting in high-scoring matches, and Greaves ended the season as the club's top scorer with 22 goals in 37 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=62}}</ref> Drake rested him for six weeks from mid-November as he did not wish the praise Greaves was receiving to go to his head; Greaves marked his return to the first team at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] with four goals in a 7\u20134 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on Christmas Day.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=71}}</ref>\n\nGreaves scored five goals in a 6\u20132 win against league champions Wolverhampton Wanderers in the third match of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=102}}</ref> Chelsea remained inconsistent, though despite his team finishing in 14th place Greaves managed to finish as the division's top scorer with 32 goals in 44 league games.<ref name=\"sdp\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=107}}</ref> Greaves scored 29 goals in 40 league matches in the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] campaign, five of which came in a 5\u20134 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|2004|p=155}}</ref> Despite his goalscoring exploits, the club could manage only an 18th-place finish, three places and three points above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1959-60|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1959-60.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Chelsea F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, Greaves scored [[hat-trick]]s against Wolves, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]; he scored four goals against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]; and hit five goals in a 7\u20131 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

Founded in 1994 by Dave Maraj, a former [[Rallying|rally]] driver from [[Trinidad]], as the motorsport wing of the '''Champion Motors''' [[car dealership]], the team has campaigned various [[Porsche]]s and [[Audi]]s in North American road racing series.  Champion Racing's extensive record includes a win at the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans|2005]], and 5 straight [[American Le Mans Series]] LMP1 championships, 2 as a private team and 3 as a factory team under the name Audi Sport North America.\n\n==Porsche years==\nChampion entered their first race at the 1993 [[12 Hours of Sebring]], finishing 21st overall and 7th in the Invitational [[Grand tourer|GT]] class with a [[Porsche 993|Porsche 911 Carrera 2]] driven by [[Justin Bell]], [[Michael Peters (racing driver)|Mike Peters]], and [[Oliver Kuttner]]. Mike Peters later stopped race driving and became team manager for the team.\n\nIn 1994, they entered a [[Porsche 911 Turbo|911 Turbo]] in several [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GT]] races, including the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and 12 Hours of Sebring.\n\nFor the 1995 season, Champion partnered with Michael Colucci Racing (MCR), and the team moved up to a 2 car team with a pair of [[Porsche 911 GT2|911 GT2]]. Champion running the #72 car (964 chassis) and MCR running the #74 car (993 chassis). After an accident put them out a Daytona, [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] and [[Bill Adam]] finished 2nd in the GTS-1 class at Sebring.  They also collected class podiums at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] and [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]] in the #74 car. In 1995 the team adopted the livery of a white background with various streaks of colours that has since become indelibly associated with the team. In fact, this livery was used on all Champion Racing entered cars, except for the special [[Flag of the United States|Stars & Stripes]] variation, using the blue and read colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] only, as tribute to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nIn 1996, Stuck and Adam won the GTS-1 class at Sebring with the #74, the first major win for Champion Racing.\n\nIn 1997 Champion scaled back to a one car team, taking over the reins of the #74 Porsche with Stuck, Adam, and [[Thierry Boutsen]] finishing 2nd in class at the 1997 Daytona 24 Hours.\n\nFor 1998, Champion Racing purchased a [[Porsche 911 GT1]] Evo.  The team ran a full season in the [[United States Road Racing Championship|USRRC]] GT1 class, winning the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] and finishing on the podium in 3 other races, winning the makes (Porsche) and drivers (Boutsen) championships.  The team also competed in three [[Professional Sportscar Racing|PSCR]] races; Boutsen, [[Bob Wollek]], and [[Andy Pilgrim]] finished 2nd in GT1 and 3rd overall at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], Boutsen and Wollek won the GT1 class at [[Road Atlanta]] in June (3rd overall), and Boutsen, Wollek and [[Ralf Kelleners]] won the GT1 class at the [[1998 Petit Le Mans|inaugural Petit Le Mans]], finishing 3rd overall, earning an automatic entry to the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\nIn 1999, Champion ran the GT1 in the new [[American Le Mans Series]].  Due to the regulations, however, they were forced to run in the [[Le Mans Prototype|Prototype]] class against theoretically faster cars.  They scored their best result in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], finishing 4th overall and in class.  The team also raced a [[Porsche 911 GT3]]-R in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], finishing 2nd in the GT class.\n\nWith no place to run the GT1 in 2000, Champion changed cars to a [[Lola B2K/10]] with a [[Porsche]] engine.  The team entered only two ALMS races (Sebring and Sears Point) and failed to finish either one.  They also entered the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, finishing 7th in class and 21st overall.  The team spent most of the season developing the car, with the aim of a high finish at the 2001 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102538/http://www.championracing.net/2006/History/Porsche_Lola.htm]\n\nDaytona 2001 started well; the team qualified 6th.  However, a loss of oil pressure seven and a half hours in caused the car to retire.  The team came back to finish 2nd in the Daytona finale at the end of the season.  The team finally found some success with the Lola at the 2002 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], finishing 4th.  After the race, the team would abandon the project, however Oliver Kuttner's Pegasus Racing would run the car in the latter half of the season.\n\n==World Challenge GT with Audi==\nIn 2000, Champion partnered with [[Audi]] to develop and run the [[Audi S4]] Competition in the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[SPEED World Challenge|Speedvision World Challenge]] series' GT class. For their first season, the pair of cars would be driven by reigning Touring Car champion [[Michael Galati]] and [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] winner [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]].

Founded in 1994 by Dave Maraj, a former [[Rallying|rally]] driver from [[Trinidad]], as the motorsport wing of the '''Champion Motors''' [[car dealership]], the team has campaigned various [[Porsche]]s and [[Audi]]s in North American road racing series.  Champion Racing's extensive record includes a win at the prestigious [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in [[2005 24 Hours of Le Mans|2005]], and 5 straight [[American Le Mans Series]] LMP1 championships, 2 as a private team and 3 as a factory team under the name Audi Sport North America.\n\n==Porsche years==\nChampion entered their first race at the 1993 [[12 Hours of Sebring]], finishing 21st overall and 7th in the Invitational [[Grand tourer|GT]] class with a [[Porsche 993|Porsche 911 Carrera 2]] driven by [[Justin Bell]], [[Michael Peters (racing driver)|Mike Peters]], and [[Oliver Kuttner]]. Mike Peters later stopped race driving and became team manager for the team.\n\nIn 1994, they entered a [[Porsche 911 Turbo|911 Turbo]] in several [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GT]] races, including the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and 12 Hours of Sebring.\n\nFor the 1995 season, Champion partnered with Michael Colucci Racing (MCR), and the team moved up to a 2 car team with a pair of [[Porsche 911 GT2|911 GT2]]. Champion running the #72 car (964 chassis) and MCR running the #74 car (993 chassis). After an accident put them out a Daytona, [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] and [[Bill Adam]] finished 2nd in the GTS-1 class at Sebring.  They also collected class podiums at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] and [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]] in the #74 car. In 1995 the team adopted the livery of a white background with various streaks of colours that has since become indelibly associated with the team. In fact, this livery was used on all Champion Racing entered cars, except for the special [[Flag of the United States|Stars & Stripes]] variation, using the blue and read colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] only, as tribute to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nIn 1996, Stuck and Adam won the GTS-1 class at Sebring with the #74, the first major win for Champion Racing.\n\nIn 1997 Champion scaled back to a one car team, taking over the reins of the #74 Porsche with Stuck, Adam, and [[Thierry Boutsen]] finishing 2nd in class at the 1997 Daytona 24 Hours.\n\nFor 1998, Champion Racing purchased a [[Porsche 911 GT1]] Evo.  The team ran a full season in the [[United States Road Racing Championship|USRRC]] GT1 class, winning the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] and finishing on the podium in 3 other races, winning the makes (Porsche) and drivers (Boutsen) championships.  The team also competed in three [[Professional Sportscar Racing|PSCR]] races; Boutsen, [[Bob Wollek]], and [[Andy Pilgrim]] finished 2nd in GT1 and 3rd overall at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], Boutsen and Wollek won the GT1 class at [[Road Atlanta]] in June (3rd overall), and Boutsen, Wollek and [[Ralf Kelleners]] won the GT1 class at the [[1998 Petit Le Mans|inaugural Petit Le Mans]], finishing 3rd overall, earning an automatic entry to the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\nIn 1999, Champion ran the GT1 in the new [[American Le Mans Series]].  Due to the regulations, however, they were forced to run in the [[Le Mans Prototype|Prototype]] class against theoretically faster cars.  They scored their best result in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], finishing 4th overall and in class.  The team also raced a [[Porsche 911 GT3]]-R in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], finishing 2nd in the GT class.\n\nWith no place to run the GT1 in 2000, Champion changed cars to a [[Lola B2K/10]] with a [[Porsche]] engine.  The team entered only two ALMS races (Sebring and Sears Point) and failed to finish either one.  They also entered the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, finishing 7th in class and 21st overall.  The team spent most of the season developing the car, with the aim of a high finish at the 2001 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102538/http://www.championracing.net/2006/History/Porsche_Lola.htm]\n\nDaytona 2001 started well; the team qualified 6th.  However, a loss of oil pressure seven and a half hours in caused the car to retire.  The team came back to finish 2nd in the Daytona finale at the end of the season.  The team finally found some success with the Lola at the 2002 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], finishing 4th.  After the race, the team would abandon the project, however Oliver Kuttner's Pegasus Racing would run the car in the latter half of the season.\n\n==World Challenge GT with Audi==\nIn 2000, Champion partnered with [[Audi]] to develop and run the [[Audi S4]] Competition in the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[SPEED World Challenge|Speedvision World Challenge]] series' GT class. For their first season, the pair of cars would be driven by reigning Touring Car champion [[Michael Galati]] and [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] winner [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]].  Bell finished 9th in the opening round at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway|Charlotte]].  Galati would take 2nd in the championship, winning at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]] and taking two other podiums.  In 2001, Galati won the GT drivers' championship, taking 4 wins, and Audi won the manufacturers' championship by 1 point over [[Acura]].  In 2002, Galati would repeat as champion, with Bell 7th, and Audi 2nd in the manufacturers' standings.\n\nIn 2003, Champion debuted the new [[Audi RS6]] Competition.

The novelette award is available for works of fiction of between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out in the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|short story]], [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|novella]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|novel]] categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe Hugo Award for Best Novelette was first awarded in 1955, and was subsequently awarded in 1956, 1958, and 1959, lapsing in 1960. The category was reinstated for 1967 through 1969, before lapsing again in 1970; after returning in 1973, it has remained to date.  In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novelettes for 1939, 1941, 1943\u20141946, 1951, and 1954.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 63 nomination years, 197 authors have had works nominated; 48 of these have won, including coauthors and Retro Hugos. 1 translator has been noted along with the author whose work she translated. [[Poul Anderson]], [[Isaac Asimov]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] both have received the most Hugos for Best Novelette at three, with Ellison having been nominated a total of six times, while seven other authors have won twice. [[Mike Resnick]] has had the most nominations at eight, and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and [[Greg Egan]] have been nominated seven times each. Fifteen other authors have been nominated at least four times, while Egan has the most number of nominations without winning.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the award presentation constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The novelettes on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novelette was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the novelette was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Novelette\n! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1954 in literature|1955]]\n| {{sortname|Walter M.|Miller, Jr.}}* || {{sort|\"Darfstellar\"|\"[[The Darfsteller]]\"}} || ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" rowspan=9| [[1955 in literature|1956]]\n| {{sortname|Murray|Leinster}}* || \"[[Exploration Team]]\" || ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|L.

}}\n\nThe '''Hugo Award for Best Novelette''' is one of the [[Hugo Award]]s given each year for science fiction or fantasy stories published or translated into English during the previous calendar year. The novelette award is available for works of fiction of between 7,500 and 17,500 words; awards are also given out in the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|short story]], [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|novella]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|novel]] categories. The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe Hugo Award for Best Novelette was first awarded in 1955, and was subsequently awarded in 1956, 1958, and 1959, lapsing in 1960. The category was reinstated for 1967 through 1969, before lapsing again in 1970; after returning in 1973, it has remained to date.  In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years after 1939 in which no awards were originally given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been given for novelettes for 1939, 1941, 1943\u20141946, 1951, and 1954.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 63 nomination years, 197 authors have had works nominated; 48 of these have won, including coauthors and Retro Hugos. 1 translator has been noted along with the author whose work she translated. [[Poul Anderson]], [[Isaac Asimov]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] both have received the most Hugos for Best Novelette at three, with Ellison having been nominated a total of six times, while seven other authors have won twice. [[Mike Resnick]] has had the most nominations at eight, and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and [[Greg Egan]] have been nominated seven times each. Fifteen other authors have been nominated at least four times, while Egan has the most number of nominations without winning.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the award presentation constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The novelettes on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novelette was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\". Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the novelette was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Novelette\n! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1954 in literature|1955]]\n| {{sortname|Walter M.|Miller, Jr.}}* || {{sort|\"Darfstellar\"|\"[[The Darfsteller]]\"}} || ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" rowspan=9| [[1955 in literature|1956]]\n| {{sortname|Murray|Leinster}}* || \"[[Exploration Team]]\" || ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| {{sortname|L.

He previously played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Rowland-Smith also represented Australia in the [[World Baseball Classic]] three times and in the [[Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]]. He batted and threw left-handed.\n\nBorn in [[Sydney]], Rowland-Smith grew up watching MLB games on videocassette. Signed out of high school by the Seattle Mariners, he spent the next several years pitching for their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams. Promoted to Seattle for the first time in July 2007, he struck out the first batter he faced, former Mariners' star [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]. Rowland-Smith began 2008 as a [[relief pitcher]] for the Mariners but was sent to the minor leagues briefly in July to work on becoming a [[starting pitcher]]. He rejoined the team in August and remained in their starting rotation the rest of the year. In 2009, he made one start for the Mariners at the beginning of the year before going on the [[disabled list]] with triceps tendinitis. Rejoining the team in July, he completed the eighth inning in three of his remaining starts for Seattle. In 2010, he made a career-high 20 starts for the Mariners but posted a 1\u201310 record and a 6.75 [[earned run average]] (ERA). Seattle allowed him to become a [[free agent]] after the year.\n\nOver the next three seasons, Rowland-Smith pitched in the minor leagues for several teams. In 2014, he began the season with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], much to his excitement as the Diamondbacks were opening the 2014 season in Australia. His time with the Diamondbacks did not last long, as the team [[designated for assignment|designated him for assignment]] on April 18. Rowland-Smith pitched for some minor league teams the remainder of the year, then joined the [[EDA Rhinos]] of the [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]] in 2015. He pitched for the [[Brisbane Bandits]] of the [[Australian Baseball League]] in January of 2017, then retired after the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]].\n\n==Early life==\nRowland-Smith was born January 26, 1983, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

He previously played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Rowland-Smith also represented Australia in the [[World Baseball Classic]] three times and in the [[Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]]. He batted and threw left-handed.\n\nBorn in [[Sydney]], Rowland-Smith grew up watching MLB games on videocassette. Signed out of high school by the Seattle Mariners, he spent the next several years pitching for their [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams. Promoted to Seattle for the first time in July 2007, he struck out the first batter he faced, former Mariners' star [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]]. Rowland-Smith began 2008 as a [[relief pitcher]] for the Mariners but was sent to the minor leagues briefly in July to work on becoming a [[starting pitcher]]. He rejoined the team in August and remained in their starting rotation the rest of the year. In 2009, he made one start for the Mariners at the beginning of the year before going on the [[disabled list]] with triceps tendinitis. Rejoining the team in July, he completed the eighth inning in three of his remaining starts for Seattle. In 2010, he made a career-high 20 starts for the Mariners but posted a 1\u201310 record and a 6.75 [[earned run average]] (ERA). Seattle allowed him to become a [[free agent]] after the year.\n\nOver the next three seasons, Rowland-Smith pitched in the minor leagues for several teams. In 2014, he began the season with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], much to his excitement as the Diamondbacks were opening the 2014 season in Australia. His time with the Diamondbacks did not last long, as the team [[designated for assignment|designated him for assignment]] on April 18. Rowland-Smith pitched for some minor league teams the remainder of the year, then joined the [[EDA Rhinos]] of the [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]] in 2015. He pitched for the [[Brisbane Bandits]] of the [[Australian Baseball League]] in January of 2017, then retired after the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]].\n\n==Early life==\nRowland-Smith was born January 26, 1983, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].
