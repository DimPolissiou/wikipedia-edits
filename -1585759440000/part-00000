Its total accumulated distance through British Columbia is {{convert|1,039|km|mi|abbr=on}}, including the distance travelled on [[Ferry Boat|ferries]]. It is the westernmost portion of the \"Highway 1\" designation of the TCH through [[Western Canada]], which extends to the [[Manitoba]]\u2013[[Ontario]] boundary. The Lower Mainland is the second busiest segment of the Freeway of all, which falls behind the 401 in Toronto section for freeway traffic in Canada. \n\n==Vancouver Island section==\n[[File:Mile 0 TCH Victoria BC.jpg|left|thumb|The beginning of Hwy 1 at the Mile Zero monument in Victoria]]\n[[File:3377-3379 Trans-Canada Hwy 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Vancouver Island section]]\nThe [[Vancouver Island]] branch of Highway 1, known locally as the ''[[Island Highway]]'' (a name shared with [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]]), is the main thoroughfare on the south Island. The highway was first given the \"1\" designation in 1941, and originally went from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] to [[Kelsey Bay, British Columbia|Kelsey Bay]], a small coastal community north of [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]]. Highway 1 on the Island was shortened to terminate in the downtown core of the city of [[Nanaimo]] in 1953, with the section north of Nanaimo being re-numbered [[British Columbia Highway 19|19]]. When [[BC Ferries]] took over the ferry route between Departure Bay in Nanaimo and Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver in 1961, Highway 1 on the Island was moved to the Departure Bay ferry dock.\n\n===Route details===\nThe Island section of Highway 1, which is {{convert|116|km|mi}} in total length, begins at the intersection of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road in Victoria, where a large \"mile zero\" sign is erected. Highway 1 proceeds north through the city of Victoria as an urban arterial street for {{Convert|4|km||abbr=}}, passing by the southern terminus of [[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]], before leaving the city at Tolmie Avenue. Once out of Victoria there are two at grade intersections at Boleskine Rd and Tillicum Rd. Highway 1 then continues on a {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long four to six lane freeway, with seven interchanges along its length, one of which leads to the start of [[British Columbia Highway 14|Highway 14]]. The freeway segment ends at the signalized intersection with Westshore Parkway. After the Westshore Parkway intersection, the highway narrows to two lanes as it enters [[Goldstream Provincial Park]]. The highway from this point is known locally as [[Malahat, British Columbia|Malahat]] Drive.\n\nFrom the southern entrance to Goldstream Provincial Park, the Malahat section of Highway 1, which is known for its steep grades, goes north for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  It follows the [[Goldstream River]] through the park to the west shore of [[Finlayson Arm]], becomes three lanes on its exit from the park, and passes through the community of Malahat proper, as well as the Malahat Summit, the highest point on the Island section of Highway 1 at {{Convert|352|m||abbr=on}}, en route. The Malahat portion of the highway is a mix of 2, 3 and 4 lane cross-sections. The section between Tunnel Hill and Shawnigan Lake Road is four lanes. 65 per cent of the Malahat highway is divided with concrete median. The Malahat section ends when it reaches the community of [[Mill Bay, British Columbia|Mill Bay]].\n\nIn Mill Bay, Highway 1 once again widens out into four lanes (with an interchange at Mill Bay Road at Bamberton), then passes through signalized intersections at Butterfield Road, Frayne Road and Deloume Road. Highway 1 then travels north through a gauntlet of 15 traffic lights for {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}}. These provide access to [[Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia|Shawnigan Lake]] (stoplights at Shawnigan Lake-Mill Bay Road), [[Cobble Hill, British Columbia|Cobble Hill]] (Cobble Hill Road, Hutchinson Road and Fisher Road), [[Cowichan Bay, British Columbia|Cowichan Bay]] (Cowichan Bay Road, Koksilah Road, and Bench Road) and [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]] (closely spaced signals at Allenby Road, Boys Road, Trunk Road, Coronation Avenue, James Street, Beverly Street, Green Road, and Drinkwater Road). Next is a signalized junction with [[British Columbia Highway 18|Highway 18]]. The highway then proceeds north for {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} through stoplights at Mays Road and Mount Sicker Road to a signalized intersection at Henry Road serving [[Chemainus, British Columbia|Chemainus]].\n\nFrom the Chemainus junction, Highway 1 travels {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest to the city of [[Ladysmith, British Columbia|Ladysmith]] accessed by intersections with traffic lights at Davis Road, Roberts Street, and Ludlow Road. It then continues northwest for another {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} through signalized junctions at Oyster Sto-Lo Road, Cedar Road, Timberlands Road, and Spitfire Way, the last of which provides access to Nanaimo Airport. The highway then reaches an unsignalized junction at [[Cassidy, British Columbia|Cassidy]]. Immediately after crossing a bridge over the [[Nanaimo River]], there is an interchange with Nanaimo River Road. There is then a signalized intersection at Morden Road. Highway 1 enters the City of Nanaimo about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Cassidy, where [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]] merges at an interchange onto the highway from the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]]. The two highways follow a short freeway that reaches 7 lanes at its widest point. It runs another {{Convert|2|km||abbr=on}} north to a point where Highways 1 and 19 split off at a junction with Cedar Road. Highway 19 proceeds northwest to bypass Nanaimo, while Highway 1 continues north through the city of Nanaimo for {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Departure Bay, British Columbia|Departure Bay]], where the Island section of Highway 1 terminates.\n\nHighway 1 then enters Departure Bay via ferry, turning east-northeast to enter the [[Strait of Georgia]] just north of [[Newcastle Island]]. The downtown core of Vancouver comes into view as the route approaches the entrance to Howe Sound. The highway then turns north-northeast just west of Passage Island to enter Queen Charlotte Channel, then rounds the Whytecliff Peninsula to enter the [[Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver|Horseshoe Bay]] ferry terminal, {{Convert|57|km|nmi|abbr=on}} from the Departure Bay dock.\n\n==Lower Mainland section==\n[[File:BChighway1.svg|thumb|center|620px|Highway 1 through Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, highlighted in red.]]\n[[File:Horshbay-ferry-lineup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ferry traffic on Highway 1 at the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal.]]\n[[File:Ironworkers Memorial Bridge Vancouver BC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]]\n[[File:British Columbia Highway 1 as it enters Vancouver from Burnaby.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Highway 1 as it enters Vancouver from Burnaby.]]\n\nLike its Island section, the Highway on the [[Lower Mainland]] was first given the \"1\" designation in 1941. Highway 1's original alignment started out within the city limits of [[Vancouver]], and followed Kingsway from Vancouver to [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], and then went along the Fraser Highway to [[Clearbrook, British Columbia|Clearbrook]]. From [[Chilliwack]], the highway originally went to [[Rosedale, British Columbia|Rosedale]], which is a community just east of Chilliwack, along [[Yale Road]], then along Flood-Hope Road to where it picks up its current alignment just across the [[Fraser River]] from [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]].\n\nIn 1959, Highway 1 was given an extension from within Vancouver to [[Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver|Horseshoe Bay]] by way of the [[Lions' Gate Bridge]] and Taylor Way in [[West Vancouver]]. In 1962, the section between Clearbrook and Chilliwack was re-routed to a new expressway.\n\nIn 1964, the Clearbrook\u2013Rosedale section of Highway 1 was restored to its original alignment. Also in that year, a new expressway (or \"freeway\"), originally designated as Highway 401, opened up on Highway 1's current alignment between West Vancouver and Rosedale. The expressway became part of Highway 1 in 1973.\n\nIn 1986, Highway 1 between Chilliwack and Hope was improved to a freeway. Through the 1990s, all signals and intersections on Highway 1 through Greater Vancouver were removed, making the entire section of Highway 1 between Horseshoe Bay and Hope a freeway.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Highway 1 between 152nd Street in Surrey and [[British Columbia Highway 11|Highway 11]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] was designated as the '''Highway of Heroes'''.<ref>{{cite web|author1=TranBC|title=Highway of Heroes|url=https://www.tranbc.ca/2011/07/18/highway-of-heroes/|website=Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|publisher=Government of British Columbia|accessdate=March 9, 2018|date=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Route details===\nHighway 1's total length in the Lower Mainland is {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On the Mainland, the highway begins at the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal in [[West Vancouver]]. From here to the [[Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]], the highway is known locally as the ''Upper Levels Highway''. There are nine interchanges on the {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the Highway within West Vancouver. The first interchange east of Horseshoe Bay brings [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] onto a [[concurrency (road)|common alignment]] with Highway 1. After Taylor Way, where Highway 99 takes the exit off Highway 1, the highway crosses over the [[Capilano River]] into the [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]]. Highway 1 travels for {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the District and the [[North Vancouver (city)|City of North Vancouver]], passing through seven interchanges, until crossing the {{convert|1292|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]] over the [[Burrard Inlet]] into Vancouver. (The bridge, previously known as the Second Narrows Bridge, was renamed to commemorate the 27 workers who lost their lives during its construction.)\n[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby.]]\n[[File:Vancouver Portmann-Bridge 2015.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|260x260px|The new [[Port Mann Bridge]], crossing the Fraser River]]\nThe {{Convert|4|km||adj=mid|-long}} long stretch of Highway 1 through the eastern part of Vancouver is the only freeway within Vancouver's city limits. Highway 1 from Vancouver to Surrey is the busiest segment of the entire freeway in the Lower Mainland.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In Vancouver, Highway 1 travels through the [[Cassiar Tunnel]] and passes through three interchanges leading to Downtown before crossing into [[Burnaby]] at the interchange with Boundary Road. The Burnaby stretch of Highway 1 is {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and goes through four interchanges around the city centre before proceeding into [[Coquitlam]]. The Coquitlam stretch is the widest segment in Western Canada of Highway 1. It lasts {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with two interchanges along its length, the westernmost of them also connecting to [[New Westminster]]. The easternmost interchange on Highway 1 in Coquitlam, known as the [[Cape Horn Interchange]], leads to [[British Columbia Highway 7|Highway 7]] and [[British Columbia Highway 7B|Highway 7B]]. Leaving Coquitlam, Highway 1 crosses the Fraser River over the [[Port Mann Bridge]] into [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n\nSections of Highway 1 from Grandview Highway in Vancouver to 208 Street in Langley vary from being 3 to 4 lanes in each direction and shortens to two lanes after leaving Langley (Metro Vancouver) and enters Abbotsford (Fraser Valley). With one of these lanes being a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane]]. These HOV lanes were constructed in 1998 as part of the BC MOT's \"Go Green\" project to promote the use of HOV vehicles, and cost $62 million.<ref>{{cite web |title= Frontier to Freeway&nbsp;\u2013 A short illustrated history of the roads in British Columbia|url= http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/frontiertofreeway/index.htm|publisher= British Columbia Ministry of Transportation|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Surrey, Highway 1 has five interchanges - 152 St (accessed by getting in rightmost lanes before the Port Mann Bridge), 156 St (HOV only), 160 St/104 Ave, one that connects to [[British Columbia Highway 15|Highway 15]] and [[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]], and 192 St. {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the Highway's entry into Surrey, the Highway crosses into the [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Township of Langley]]. There are four interchanges on Highway 1 in its {{convert|18|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} stretch through Langley. One leads to 200 St, Langley's major thoroughfare, an HOV-only interchange leads to 202 St, another leads to [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]], and the final leads to [[British Columbia Highway 13|Highway 13]]. Construction is also currently underway on another interchange within Langley at 216 St.\n\nHighway 1 then crosses from [[Metro Vancouver]] into the [[Fraser Valley Regional District]] upon entry into [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. There are six interchanges on Highway 1 in its {{convert|33|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} stretch through Abbotsford, one of which leads to [[British Columbia Highway 11|Highway 11]]. Once Highway 1 leaves Abbotsford, it crosses over the Vedder Canal into Chilliwack. The highway goes through Chilliwack for {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through six interchanges within the city (Yale Road West, Lickman Road, Evans Road, Vedder Road, Prest Road, and Annis Road). An exit to Young Road is also available westbound on the highway.\n[[File: Highway 1 between Hope and Yale.JPG|thumb|Fraser Canyon along British Columbia Highway #1 between Hope and Yale]]\n\n{{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} after leaving Chilliwack, Highway 1 reaches an interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 9|Highway 9]]. East of the Highway 9 interchange, Highway 1 hugs the south bank of the Fraser River for {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through seven interchanges until reaching the interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 3|Highway 3]] at [[Hope, British Columbia]]. Highway 1 takes the exit off the freeway at this point. (The freeway alignments of Highways 3 and [[Coquihalla Highway|5]] continue from this exit, from Exit 170 Highway 5 continues as a freeway until it meets up again with Highway 1 just west of Kamloops at Exit 362.)  Most traffic travelling between Hope and Kamloops follows [[Coquihalla Highway|Highway 5]] as it takes over an hour and a half less time to travel compared to following Highway 1.\n\n==Interior section==\n[[File:British Columbia Highway 1 just east of Kamloops heading westbound..jpg|thumb|Highway 1 just east of Kamloops heading westbound.]]\nIn the Kootenays, Highway 1 originally went around the [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)]] area in its section from [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]] to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] along what was known as the [[Big Bend Highway]]. In 1962, the section of Highway between Revelstoke and Golden was re-routed through Rogers Pass. This realignment reduced the travelling distance between the two towns by more than {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}. Over the 1970s and 1980s, Highway 1's alignment between Hope and [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]] underwent a massive overhaul, including new tunnels and river spans. In [[Kamloops]], a new bypass was constructed to re-route traffic on Highway 1 around the downtown area of the city.\n\n===Route details===\nThe Interior section of Highway 1 is {{convert|695|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and closely follows the path of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. After leaving the freeway, Highway 1 courses through the town centre of Hope for {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} before heading north across the Fraser River. At this point, Highway 1 becomes two lanes. {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} north of the Fraser crossing, Highway 1 reaches its east junction with [[British Columbia Highway 7|Highway 7]]. Continuing from the Highway 7 junction, Highway 1 goes {{convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on}} north on a route that includes seven mountain tunnels, past the communities of [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], [[Spuzzum, British Columbia|Spuzzum]] and [[Boston Bar, British Columbia|Boston Bar]], before reaching its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 12|Highway 12]] at [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]]. Leaving the Fraser River, and following the [[Thompson River]] another {{convert|37|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast, Highway 1 reaches a junction with another numbered route, [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]]. {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the Highway 8 junction, Highway 1 passes through a junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]]. Continuing {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north, the highway reaches the community of [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]], where [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] merges onto the Trans-Canada from the north.\n\nEast of Cache Creek, Highways 1 and 97 proceed on their [[concurrency (road)|common alignment]] for {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through [[Savona, British Columbia|Savona]] en route to [[Kamloops]]. [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] merges onto the Trans-Canada from the south at this point, returning the freeway to Highway 1.\n\nThe 1/97/5 concurrency proceeds east for {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} on a freeway through the western part of Kamloops to where Highway 5 diverges north. Highways 1 and 97 leave Kamloops to the east {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} later. The highway continues east for another {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Monte Creek, British Columbia|Monte Creek]], where the freeway ends and Highway 97 diverges south from Highway 1. For the next {{convert|52|km|mi|abbr=on}} east, Highway 1 takes a winding two-lane route through the communities of [[Pritchard, British Columbia|Pritchard]], [[Chase, British Columbia|Chase]] and [[Sorrento, British Columbia|Sorrento]]. The highway widens to four lanes just east of Sorrento and remains in this alignment for the next {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} before reaching the city of [[Salmon Arm]] on [[Shuswap Lake]].  [[British Columbia Highway 97B|Highway 97B]] meets Highway 1 three kilometres east of Salmon Arm's city centre.\n\n[[File:rogers pass.jpg|thumb|right|The peak of Rogers Pass]]\nAfter Salmon Arm, Highway 1 goes east for {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}} to a junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97A|Highway 97A]] at [[Sicamous, British Columbia|Sicamous]], following the south shore of the Salmon Arm of the [[Shuswap Lakes]] for most of this stretch. Over the next {{convert|71|km|mi|abbr=on}} east, Highway 1 winds through the communities of [[Malakwa, British Columbia|Malakwa]] (the highway widens to four lanes as it passes through Malakwa), [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]] and the [[Three Valley Gap, British Columbia|Three Valley Gap]], before reaching its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 23|Highway 23]] at [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]], on the [[Columbia River]]. The next {{convert|148|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Highway 1 to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] winds east through [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]] and [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]], where the [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]] area is located. There are eight [[snow shed]]s on Highway 1 between Revelstoke and Golden\u2014three of them lie west of Rogers Pass, while five lie to the east. Motorists are advised to check their fuel level as they are leaving either Revelstoke or Golden as there are no refuelling facilities between the two towns.\n\nAfter Glacier National Park and a [[time zone]] boundary crossing, Highway 1 passes over the Columbia River again at [[Donald, British Columbia|Donald]], and then reaches its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 95|Highway 95]] at Golden. {{convert|73|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Golden, after Highway 1 has passed through [[Yoho National Park]] and the community of [[Field, British Columbia|Field]], Highway 1 crosses the [[Continental Divide]] (via [[Kicking Horse Pass]]) into [[Alberta]].\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{BCinttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=length>{{cite report\n |title=Landmark Kilometre Inventory\n

Its total accumulated distance through British Columbia is {{convert|1,039|km|mi|abbr=on}}, including the distance travelled on [[Ferry Boat|ferries]]. It is the westernmost portion of the \"Highway 1\" designation of the TCH through [[Western Canada]], which extends to the [[Manitoba]]\u2013[[Ontario]] boundary. The Lower Mainland is the busiest segment of the Freeway of all, which falls second after the 401 in Toronto for freeway traffic in Canada. \n\n==Vancouver Island section==\n[[File:Mile 0 TCH Victoria BC.jpg|left|thumb|The beginning of Hwy 1 at the Mile Zero monument in Victoria]]\n[[File:3377-3379 Trans-Canada Hwy 2018.jpg|left|thumb|Vancouver Island section]]\nThe [[Vancouver Island]] branch of Highway 1, known locally as the ''[[Island Highway]]'' (a name shared with [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]]), is the main thoroughfare on the south Island. The highway was first given the \"1\" designation in 1941, and originally went from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] to [[Kelsey Bay, British Columbia|Kelsey Bay]], a small coastal community north of [[Campbell River, British Columbia|Campbell River]]. Highway 1 on the Island was shortened to terminate in the downtown core of the city of [[Nanaimo]] in 1953, with the section north of Nanaimo being re-numbered [[British Columbia Highway 19|19]]. When [[BC Ferries]] took over the ferry route between Departure Bay in Nanaimo and Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver in 1961, Highway 1 on the Island was moved to the Departure Bay ferry dock.\n\n===Route details===\nThe Island section of Highway 1, which is {{convert|116|km|mi}} in total length, begins at the intersection of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road in Victoria, where a large \"mile zero\" sign is erected. Highway 1 proceeds north through the city of Victoria as an urban arterial street for {{Convert|4|km||abbr=}}, passing by the southern terminus of [[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]], before leaving the city at Tolmie Avenue. Once out of Victoria there are two at grade intersections at Boleskine Rd and Tillicum Rd. Highway 1 then continues on a {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long four to six lane freeway, with seven interchanges along its length, one of which leads to the start of [[British Columbia Highway 14|Highway 14]]. The freeway segment ends at the signalized intersection with Westshore Parkway. After the Westshore Parkway intersection, the highway narrows to two lanes as it enters [[Goldstream Provincial Park]]. The highway from this point is known locally as [[Malahat, British Columbia|Malahat]] Drive.\n\nFrom the southern entrance to Goldstream Provincial Park, the Malahat section of Highway 1, which is known for its steep grades, goes north for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  It follows the [[Goldstream River]] through the park to the west shore of [[Finlayson Arm]], becomes three lanes on its exit from the park, and passes through the community of Malahat proper, as well as the Malahat Summit, the highest point on the Island section of Highway 1 at {{Convert|352|m||abbr=on}}, en route. The Malahat portion of the highway is a mix of 2, 3 and 4 lane cross-sections. The section between Tunnel Hill and Shawnigan Lake Road is four lanes. 65 per cent of the Malahat highway is divided with concrete median. The Malahat section ends when it reaches the community of [[Mill Bay, British Columbia|Mill Bay]].\n\nIn Mill Bay, Highway 1 once again widens out into four lanes (with an interchange at Mill Bay Road at Bamberton), then passes through signalized intersections at Butterfield Road, Frayne Road and Deloume Road. Highway 1 then travels north through a gauntlet of 15 traffic lights for {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}}. These provide access to [[Shawnigan Lake, British Columbia|Shawnigan Lake]] (stoplights at Shawnigan Lake-Mill Bay Road), [[Cobble Hill, British Columbia|Cobble Hill]] (Cobble Hill Road, Hutchinson Road and Fisher Road), [[Cowichan Bay, British Columbia|Cowichan Bay]] (Cowichan Bay Road, Koksilah Road, and Bench Road) and [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]] (closely spaced signals at Allenby Road, Boys Road, Trunk Road, Coronation Avenue, James Street, Beverly Street, Green Road, and Drinkwater Road). Next is a signalized junction with [[British Columbia Highway 18|Highway 18]]. The highway then proceeds north for {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} through stoplights at Mays Road and Mount Sicker Road to a signalized intersection at Henry Road serving [[Chemainus, British Columbia|Chemainus]].\n\nFrom the Chemainus junction, Highway 1 travels {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest to the city of [[Ladysmith, British Columbia|Ladysmith]] accessed by intersections with traffic lights at Davis Road, Roberts Street, and Ludlow Road. It then continues northwest for another {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} through signalized junctions at Oyster Sto-Lo Road, Cedar Road, Timberlands Road, and Spitfire Way, the last of which provides access to Nanaimo Airport. The highway then reaches an unsignalized junction at [[Cassidy, British Columbia|Cassidy]]. Immediately after crossing a bridge over the [[Nanaimo River]], there is an interchange with Nanaimo River Road. There is then a signalized intersection at Morden Road. Highway 1 enters the City of Nanaimo about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Cassidy, where [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]] merges at an interchange onto the highway from the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Duke Point, British Columbia|Duke Point]]. The two highways follow a short freeway that reaches 7 lanes at its widest point. It runs another {{Convert|2|km||abbr=on}} north to a point where Highways 1 and 19 split off at a junction with Cedar Road. Highway 19 proceeds northwest to bypass Nanaimo, while Highway 1 continues north through the city of Nanaimo for {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the B.C. Ferry terminal at [[Departure Bay, British Columbia|Departure Bay]], where the Island section of Highway 1 terminates.\n\nHighway 1 then enters Departure Bay via ferry, turning east-northeast to enter the [[Strait of Georgia]] just north of [[Newcastle Island]]. The downtown core of Vancouver comes into view as the route approaches the entrance to Howe Sound. The highway then turns north-northeast just west of Passage Island to enter Queen Charlotte Channel, then rounds the Whytecliff Peninsula to enter the [[Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver|Horseshoe Bay]] ferry terminal, {{Convert|57|km|nmi|abbr=on}} from the Departure Bay dock.\n\n==Lower Mainland section==\n[[File:BChighway1.svg|thumb|center|620px|Highway 1 through Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, highlighted in red.]]\n[[File:Horshbay-ferry-lineup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ferry traffic on Highway 1 at the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal.]]\n[[File:Ironworkers Memorial Bridge Vancouver BC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]]\n[[File:British Columbia Highway 1 as it enters Vancouver from Burnaby.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Highway 1 as it enters Vancouver from Burnaby.]]\n\nLike its Island section, the Highway on the [[Lower Mainland]] was first given the \"1\" designation in 1941. Highway 1's original alignment started out within the city limits of [[Vancouver]], and followed Kingsway from Vancouver to [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], and then went along the Fraser Highway to [[Clearbrook, British Columbia|Clearbrook]]. From [[Chilliwack]], the highway originally went to [[Rosedale, British Columbia|Rosedale]], which is a community just east of Chilliwack, along [[Yale Road]], then along Flood-Hope Road to where it picks up its current alignment just across the [[Fraser River]] from [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]].\n\nIn 1959, Highway 1 was given an extension from within Vancouver to [[Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver|Horseshoe Bay]] by way of the [[Lions' Gate Bridge]] and Taylor Way in [[West Vancouver]]. In 1962, the section between Clearbrook and Chilliwack was re-routed to a new expressway.\n\nIn 1964, the Clearbrook\u2013Rosedale section of Highway 1 was restored to its original alignment. Also in that year, a new expressway (or \"freeway\"), originally designated as Highway 401, opened up on Highway 1's current alignment between West Vancouver and Rosedale. The expressway became part of Highway 1 in 1973.\n\nIn 1986, Highway 1 between Chilliwack and Hope was improved to a freeway. Through the 1990s, all signals and intersections on Highway 1 through Greater Vancouver were removed, making the entire section of Highway 1 between Horseshoe Bay and Hope a freeway.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Highway 1 between 152nd Street in Surrey and [[British Columbia Highway 11|Highway 11]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] was designated as the '''Highway of Heroes'''.<ref>{{cite web|author1=TranBC|title=Highway of Heroes|url=https://www.tranbc.ca/2011/07/18/highway-of-heroes/|website=Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|publisher=Government of British Columbia|accessdate=March 9, 2018|date=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Route details===\nHighway 1's total length in the Lower Mainland is {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On the Mainland, the highway begins at the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal in [[West Vancouver]]. From here to the [[Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]], the highway is known locally as the ''Upper Levels Highway''. There are nine interchanges on the {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of the Highway within West Vancouver. The first interchange east of Horseshoe Bay brings [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] onto a [[concurrency (road)|common alignment]] with Highway 1. After Taylor Way, where Highway 99 takes the exit off Highway 1, the highway crosses over the [[Capilano River]] into the [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]]. Highway 1 travels for {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the District and the [[North Vancouver (city)|City of North Vancouver]], passing through seven interchanges, until crossing the {{convert|1292|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing]] over the [[Burrard Inlet]] into Vancouver. (The bridge, previously known as the Second Narrows Bridge, was renamed to commemorate the 27 workers who lost their lives during its construction.)\n[[File:Highway 1, Burnaby.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|British Columbia Highway 1 near Brentwood, Burnaby.]]\n[[File:Vancouver Portmann-Bridge 2015.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|260x260px|The new [[Port Mann Bridge]], crossing the Fraser River]]\nThe {{Convert|4|km||adj=mid|-long}} long stretch of Highway 1 through the eastern part of Vancouver is the only freeway within Vancouver's city limits. Highway 1 from Vancouver to Surrey is the busiest segment of the entire freeway in the Lower Mainland.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In Vancouver, Highway 1 travels through the [[Cassiar Tunnel]] and passes through three interchanges leading to Downtown before crossing into [[Burnaby]] at the interchange with Boundary Road. The Burnaby stretch of Highway 1 is {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and goes through four interchanges around the city centre before proceeding into [[Coquitlam]]. The Coquitlam stretch is the widest segment in Western Canada of Highway 1. It lasts {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with two interchanges along its length, the westernmost of them also connecting to [[New Westminster]]. The easternmost interchange on Highway 1 in Coquitlam, known as the [[Cape Horn Interchange]], leads to [[British Columbia Highway 7|Highway 7]] and [[British Columbia Highway 7B|Highway 7B]]. Leaving Coquitlam, Highway 1 crosses the Fraser River over the [[Port Mann Bridge]] into [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n\nSections of Highway 1 from Grandview Highway in Vancouver to 208 Street in Langley vary from being 3 to 4 lanes in each direction and shortens to two lanes after leaving Langley (Metro Vancouver) and enters Abbotsford (Fraser Valley). With one of these lanes being a [[high-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane]]. These HOV lanes were constructed in 1998 as part of the BC MOT's \"Go Green\" project to promote the use of HOV vehicles, and cost $62 million.<ref>{{cite web |title= Frontier to Freeway&nbsp;\u2013 A short illustrated history of the roads in British Columbia|url= http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/frontiertofreeway/index.htm|publisher= British Columbia Ministry of Transportation|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Surrey, Highway 1 has five interchanges - 152 St (accessed by getting in rightmost lanes before the Port Mann Bridge), 156 St (HOV only), 160 St/104 Ave, one that connects to [[British Columbia Highway 15|Highway 15]] and [[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]], and 192 St. {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the Highway's entry into Surrey, the Highway crosses into the [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Township of Langley]]. There are four interchanges on Highway 1 in its {{convert|18|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} stretch through Langley. One leads to 200 St, Langley's major thoroughfare, an HOV-only interchange leads to 202 St, another leads to [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]], and the final leads to [[British Columbia Highway 13|Highway 13]]. Construction is also currently underway on another interchange within Langley at 216 St.\n\nHighway 1 then crosses from [[Metro Vancouver]] into the [[Fraser Valley Regional District]] upon entry into [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. There are six interchanges on Highway 1 in its {{convert|33|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} stretch through Abbotsford, one of which leads to [[British Columbia Highway 11|Highway 11]]. Once Highway 1 leaves Abbotsford, it crosses over the Vedder Canal into Chilliwack. The highway goes through Chilliwack for {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through six interchanges within the city (Yale Road West, Lickman Road, Evans Road, Vedder Road, Prest Road, and Annis Road). An exit to Young Road is also available westbound on the highway.\n[[File: Highway 1 between Hope and Yale.JPG|thumb|Fraser Canyon along British Columbia Highway #1 between Hope and Yale]]\n\n{{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} after leaving Chilliwack, Highway 1 reaches an interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 9|Highway 9]]. East of the Highway 9 interchange, Highway 1 hugs the south bank of the Fraser River for {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through seven interchanges until reaching the interchange with [[British Columbia Highway 3|Highway 3]] at [[Hope, British Columbia]]. Highway 1 takes the exit off the freeway at this point. (The freeway alignments of Highways 3 and [[Coquihalla Highway|5]] continue from this exit, from Exit 170 Highway 5 continues as a freeway until it meets up again with Highway 1 just west of Kamloops at Exit 362.)  Most traffic travelling between Hope and Kamloops follows [[Coquihalla Highway|Highway 5]] as it takes over an hour and a half less time to travel compared to following Highway 1.\n\n==Interior section==\n[[File:British Columbia Highway 1 just east of Kamloops heading westbound..jpg|thumb|Highway 1 just east of Kamloops heading westbound.]]\nIn the Kootenays, Highway 1 originally went around the [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)]] area in its section from [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]] to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] along what was known as the [[Big Bend Highway]]. In 1962, the section of Highway between Revelstoke and Golden was re-routed through Rogers Pass. This realignment reduced the travelling distance between the two towns by more than {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}. Over the 1970s and 1980s, Highway 1's alignment between Hope and [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]] underwent a massive overhaul, including new tunnels and river spans. In [[Kamloops]], a new bypass was constructed to re-route traffic on Highway 1 around the downtown area of the city.\n\n===Route details===\nThe Interior section of Highway 1 is {{convert|695|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and closely follows the path of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. After leaving the freeway, Highway 1 courses through the town centre of Hope for {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} before heading north across the Fraser River. At this point, Highway 1 becomes two lanes. {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} north of the Fraser crossing, Highway 1 reaches its east junction with [[British Columbia Highway 7|Highway 7]]. Continuing from the Highway 7 junction, Highway 1 goes {{convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on}} north on a route that includes seven mountain tunnels, past the communities of [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], [[Spuzzum, British Columbia|Spuzzum]] and [[Boston Bar, British Columbia|Boston Bar]], before reaching its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 12|Highway 12]] at [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]]. Leaving the Fraser River, and following the [[Thompson River]] another {{convert|37|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast, Highway 1 reaches a junction with another numbered route, [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]]. {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the Highway 8 junction, Highway 1 passes through a junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]]. Continuing {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north, the highway reaches the community of [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]], where [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] merges onto the Trans-Canada from the north.\n\nEast of Cache Creek, Highways 1 and 97 proceed on their [[concurrency (road)|common alignment]] for {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}}, passing through [[Savona, British Columbia|Savona]] en route to [[Kamloops]]. [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] merges onto the Trans-Canada from the south at this point, returning the freeway to Highway 1.\n\nThe 1/97/5 concurrency proceeds east for {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} on a freeway through the western part of Kamloops to where Highway 5 diverges north. Highways 1 and 97 leave Kamloops to the east {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} later. The highway continues east for another {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} to [[Monte Creek, British Columbia|Monte Creek]], where the freeway ends and Highway 97 diverges south from Highway 1. For the next {{convert|52|km|mi|abbr=on}} east, Highway 1 takes a winding two-lane route through the communities of [[Pritchard, British Columbia|Pritchard]], [[Chase, British Columbia|Chase]] and [[Sorrento, British Columbia|Sorrento]]. The highway widens to four lanes just east of Sorrento and remains in this alignment for the next {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} before reaching the city of [[Salmon Arm]] on [[Shuswap Lake]].  [[British Columbia Highway 97B|Highway 97B]] meets Highway 1 three kilometres east of Salmon Arm's city centre.\n\n[[File:rogers pass.jpg|thumb|right|The peak of Rogers Pass]]\nAfter Salmon Arm, Highway 1 goes east for {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}} to a junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97A|Highway 97A]] at [[Sicamous, British Columbia|Sicamous]], following the south shore of the Salmon Arm of the [[Shuswap Lakes]] for most of this stretch. Over the next {{convert|71|km|mi|abbr=on}} east, Highway 1 winds through the communities of [[Malakwa, British Columbia|Malakwa]] (the highway widens to four lanes as it passes through Malakwa), [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]] and the [[Three Valley Gap, British Columbia|Three Valley Gap]], before reaching its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 23|Highway 23]] at [[Revelstoke, British Columbia|Revelstoke]], on the [[Columbia River]]. The next {{convert|148|km|mi|abbr=on}} of Highway 1 to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] winds east through [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]] and [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]], where the [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]] area is located. There are eight [[snow shed]]s on Highway 1 between Revelstoke and Golden\u2014three of them lie west of Rogers Pass, while five lie to the east. Motorists are advised to check their fuel level as they are leaving either Revelstoke or Golden as there are no refuelling facilities between the two towns.\n\nAfter Glacier National Park and a [[time zone]] boundary crossing, Highway 1 passes over the Columbia River again at [[Donald, British Columbia|Donald]], and then reaches its junction with [[British Columbia Highway 95|Highway 95]] at Golden. {{convert|73|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Golden, after Highway 1 has passed through [[Yoho National Park]] and the community of [[Field, British Columbia|Field]], Highway 1 crosses the [[Continental Divide]] (via [[Kicking Horse Pass]]) into [[Alberta]].\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{BCinttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=length>{{cite report\n |title=Landmark Kilometre Inventory\n

Those who lived in the general area attended services at Jamestown's church until the 1750s, when it was abandoned. By the mid-18th century, the land was heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], although the [[Battle of Green Spring]] was fought nearby at the site of former Governor Berkeley's plantation, Jamestown was apparently inconsequential.\nIn 1831, David Bullock purchased Jamestown from the Travis and Ambler families.\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], in 1861, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[William (Orgain) Allen|William Allen]], who owned the Jamestown Island, occupied Jamestown with troops he raised at his own expense with the intention of blockading the James River and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] from the Union Navy.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" /> He was soon joined by Lieutenant [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], who directed the building of batteries and conducted ordnance and armor tests for the first Confederate [[ironclad warship]], [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], which was under construction at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] in late 1861 and early 1862.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" /> Jamestown had a peak force of 1,200 men.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" />\n\nDuring the [[Peninsula Campaign]], which began later that spring, Union forces under General [[George B.

In 1892, Jamestown was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Barney. The following year, the Barneys donated 22\u00bd acres of land, including the ruined church tower, to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]).\n\nBy this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island's western shore. Visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a [[sea wall]] was constructed in 1900 to protect the area from further erosion. The archaeological remains of the original 1607 fort, which had been protected by the sea wall, were not discovered until 1996.\n\nIn 1932, [[George C.

The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]) started the movement in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown to be held on the 300th anniversary in 1907.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|title='Meet us on the War Path!': 1907 Jamestown Exposition drew millions to Hampton Roads|first=Mark St John|last=Erickson|website=dailypress.com|access-date=August 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830024225/https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs a celebration was planned, virtually no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was believed to have been long ago swallowed by the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of [[railroad|rail travel]] before automobiles were common.\n\nAs the tricentennial of the 1607 Founding of the Jamestown neared, around 1904, despite an assumption in some quarters that Richmond would be a logical location, leaders in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at [[Sewell's Point]] near the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]]. This was about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream from Jamestown in a rural section of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]]. It was a site which could become accessible by both long-distance passenger railroads and local streetcar service, with considerable frontage on the harbor of Hampton Roads. This latter feature proved ideal for the naval delegations which came from points all around the world.\n\nThe [[Jamestown Exposition]] of 1907 was one of the many [[world's fairs]] and expositions that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. Held from April 26, 1907 to December 1, 1907, attendees included US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, the Prince of Sweden, [[Mark Twain]], [[Henry H. Rogers]], and dozens of other dignitaries and famous persons. A major naval review featuring the United States' [[Great White Fleet]] was a key feature. U.S. Military officials and leaders were impressed by the location, and the Exposition site later formed the first portion of the large U.S. [[Naval Station Norfolk]] in 1918 during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|title=Jamestown Ter-Centennial Exposition of 1907|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719221140/https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|archive-date=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|title=Earth Station Nine|website=www.earthstation9.com|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921060108/http://earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|archive-date=September 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Founding of Jamestown 3 stamps 1907 issue.JPG|center|upright=2.6|thumb|<center><big>Jamestown commemorative stamps, issue of 1907</big><br>The U.S. Post Office issued a set of stamps, on the 300th anniversary of the founding of the<br>Jamestown colony.</center>]]\n\n===350th Anniversary (1957): Jamestown Festival===\n[[File:Queen elizabeth and prince phillip.gif|thumb|right|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and her consort [[Prince Philip]] inspect the replica of ''Susan Constant'' at Jamestown Festival Park in [[Virginia]] on October 16, 1957]]\nWith America's increased access to automobiles, and with improved roads and transportation, it was feasible for the 350th anniversary celebration to be held at Jamestown itself in 1957. Although erosion had cut off the land bridge between Jamestown Island and the mainland, the isthmus was restored and new access provided by the completion of the National Park Service's [[Colonial Parkway]] which led to Williamsburg and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], the other two portions of Colonial Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]]. There were also improvements of state highways. The north landing for the popular [[Jamestown Ferry]] and a portion of [[State Route 31 (Virginia)|State Route 31]] were relocated.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" />\n\nMajor projects such were developed by non-profit, state and federal agencies. [[Jamestown Festival Park]] was established by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adjacent to the entrance to Jamestown Island. Full-sized replicas of the three ships that brought the colonists, ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', and ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'' were constructed at a shipyard in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]] and placed on display at a new dock at Jamestown, where the largest, ''Susan Constant'', could be boarded by visitors. On Jamestown Island, the reconstructed [[Jamestown Glasshouse]], the Memorial Cross and the visitors center were completed and dedicated.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> A loop road was built around the island.\n\nSpecial events included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings and even an outdoor drama at [[Cape Henry, Virginia|Cape Henry]], site of the first landing of the settlers.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> This celebration continued from April 1 to November 30 with over a million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> The highlight for many of the nearly 25,000 at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957 was the visit and speech of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and her consort, [[Prince Philip]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> Queen Elizabeth II loaned a copy of the [[Magna Carta]] for the exhibition. It was her first visit to the United States since assuming the throne.\n\nThe 1957 Jamestown Festival was so successful that tourists still kept coming long after the official event was completed. Jamestown became a permanent attraction of the [[Historic Triangle]], and has been visited by families, school groups, tours, and thousands of other people continuously ever since.\n<!--For the 300th anniversary of the settlement in 1907, transportation considerations at the isolated location did not even bring Jamestown into serious contention as the venue for its own celebration. Instead, the [[Jamestown Exposition]] was held 25 miles away, at [[Sewell's Point]] on [[Hampton Roads]] in the former [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]].\n\nBy 1957, a lot of things had changed since 1907. During [[World War I]], the Sewell's Point site of the Jamestown Exposition had become part of the massive [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the largest Navy Base in the world. That site was unavailable.\n\nIn the 1930s, the US [[National Park Service]] (NPS) had acquired the rest of the land at Jamestown Island, and turned it over to the [[Colonial National Historical Park]]. Portions of the NPS's bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] had been completed between [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].\n\nFor the 350th anniversary, plans were made for Jamestown to host its own celebration. In anticipation, the remaining portion of the Colonial Parkway linking Jamestown to the other two points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]] was rushed to completion. For vehicular access, the [[isthmus]] linking the island to the mainland was restored by the NPS as part of the Colonial Parkway project. The [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] relocated the [[Glass House Point]] landing for the [[Jamestown Ferry]] and created the [[Jamestown Festival Park]] on adjacent land to the isthmus leading to the island (or peninsula) itself. Replicas of the three ships which had brought the original colonists were built, and placed on display.\n\nThe 1957 Jamestown Festival celebration was a huge success. Among many notable events, it featured a visit by U.S. Vice-President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and a state visit by Queen [[Elizabeth II of Great Britain]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. After 1957, tourism and interest in Jamestown became continuous, with both the state and the NPS's Colonial National Historical Park maintaining their complementary year-round attractions.-->\n\n===400th anniversary: Jamestown 2007===\n{{main|Jamestown 2007}}\n {{multiple image\n  | width   = 150\n  | footer  = Coins released in commemoration of the 400th anniversary\n  | image1  = Virginia quarter, reverse side, 2000.jpg\n  | alt1   =\n  | caption1 = Virginia [[State Quarters|State Quarter]] (Reverse)\n  | image2  = Jtsdobv.JPG\n  | alt2   =\n  | caption2 = [[Obverse and reverse|Obverse]] of [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary silver dollar]], the \"Three Faces of Diversity\" of Jamestown\n  | image3 = Jtg5dobv.JPG\n  | caption3 = Obverse of the [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary gold five dollar coin]]\n }}\nEarly in the 21st century, new accommodations, transportation facilities and attractions were planned in preparation for the quadricentennial of the founding of Jamestown. Numerous events were promoted under the banner of [[America's 400th Anniversary]] and promoted by the Jamestown 2007 Commission. The commemoration included 18 months of statewide, national and international festivities and events, which began in April 2006 with a tour of the new replica ''Godspeed''.\n\nIn January 2007, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] held a session at Jamestown. On May 4, 2007, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] attended a ceremony commemorating the 400th anniversary of the settlement's arrivals, reprising the honor they paid in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/05/nqueen05.xml |title=Telegraph Dead Link |accessdate=April 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005150345/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F05%2F05%2Fnqueen05.xml |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Virginia State Quarter, Jamestown was also the subject of two [[United States commemorative coin]]s celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement.

By the mid-18th century, the land was heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], although the [[Battle of Green Spring]] was fought nearby at the site of former Governor Berkeley's plantation, Jamestown was apparently inconsequential.\nIn 1831, David Bullock purchased Jamestown from the Travis and Ambler families.\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], in 1861, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[William (Orgain) Allen|William Allen]], who owned the Jamestown Island, occupied Jamestown with troops he raised at his own expense with the intention of blockading the James River and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] from the Union Navy.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" /> He was soon joined by Lieutenant [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], who directed the building of batteries and conducted ordnance and armor tests for the first Confederate [[ironclad warship]], [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], which was under construction at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] in late 1861 and early 1862.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" /> Jamestown had a peak force of 1,200 men.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Civil War\" />\n\nDuring the [[Peninsula Campaign]], which began later that spring, Union forces under General [[George B.

In 1892, Jamestown was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Barney. The following year, the Barneys donated 22\u00bd acres of land, including the ruined church tower, to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]).\n\nBy this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island's western shore. Visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a [[sea wall]] was constructed in 1900 to protect the area from further erosion. The archaeological remains of the original 1607 fort, which had been protected by the sea wall, were not discovered until 1996.\n\nIn 1932, [[George C.

The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]) started the movement in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown to be held on the 300th anniversary in 1907.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|title='Meet us on the War Path!': 1907 Jamestown Exposition drew millions to Hampton Roads|first=Mark St John|last=Erickson|website=dailypress.com|access-date=August 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830024225/https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs a celebration was planned, virtually no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was believed to have been long ago swallowed by the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of [[railroad|rail travel]] before automobiles were common.\n\nAs the tricentennial of the 1607 Founding of the Jamestown neared, around 1904, despite an assumption in some quarters that Richmond would be a logical location, leaders in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at [[Sewell's Point]] near the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]]. This was about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream from Jamestown in a rural section of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]]. It was a site which could become accessible by both long-distance passenger railroads and local streetcar service, with considerable frontage on the harbor of Hampton Roads. This latter feature proved ideal for the naval delegations which came from points all around the world.\n\nThe [[Jamestown Exposition]] of 1907 was one of the many [[world's fairs]] and expositions that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. Held from April 26, 1907 to December 1, 1907, attendees included US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, the Prince of Sweden, [[Mark Twain]], [[Henry H. Rogers]], and dozens of other dignitaries and famous persons. A major naval review featuring the United States' [[Great White Fleet]] was a key feature. U.S. Military officials and leaders were impressed by the location, and the Exposition site later formed the first portion of the large U.S. [[Naval Station Norfolk]] in 1918 during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|title=Jamestown Ter-Centennial Exposition of 1907|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719221140/https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|archive-date=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|title=Earth Station Nine|website=www.earthstation9.com|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921060108/http://earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|archive-date=September 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Founding of Jamestown 3 stamps 1907 issue.JPG|center|upright=2.6|thumb|<center><big>Jamestown commemorative stamps, issue of 1907</big><br>The U.S. Post Office issued a set of stamps, on the 300th anniversary of the founding of the<br>Jamestown colony.</center>]]\n\n===350th Anniversary (1957): Jamestown Festival===\n[[File:Queen elizabeth and prince phillip.gif|thumb|right|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and her consort [[Prince Philip]] inspect the replica of ''Susan Constant'' at Jamestown Festival Park in [[Virginia]] on October 16, 1957]]\nWith America's increased access to automobiles, and with improved roads and transportation, it was feasible for the 350th anniversary celebration to be held at Jamestown itself in 1957. Although erosion had cut off the land bridge between Jamestown Island and the mainland, the isthmus was restored and new access provided by the completion of the National Park Service's [[Colonial Parkway]] which led to Williamsburg and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], the other two portions of Colonial Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]]. There were also improvements of state highways. The north landing for the popular [[Jamestown Ferry]] and a portion of [[State Route 31 (Virginia)|State Route 31]] were relocated.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" />\n\nMajor projects such were developed by non-profit, state and federal agencies. [[Jamestown Festival Park]] was established by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adjacent to the entrance to Jamestown Island. Full-sized replicas of the three ships that brought the colonists, ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', and ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'' were constructed at a shipyard in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]] and placed on display at a new dock at Jamestown, where the largest, ''Susan Constant'', could be boarded by visitors. On Jamestown Island, the reconstructed [[Jamestown Glasshouse]], the Memorial Cross and the visitors center were completed and dedicated.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> A loop road was built around the island.\n\nSpecial events included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings and even an outdoor drama at [[Cape Henry, Virginia|Cape Henry]], site of the first landing of the settlers.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> This celebration continued from April 1 to November 30 with over a million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> The highlight for many of the nearly 25,000 at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957 was the visit and speech of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and her consort, [[Prince Philip]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology\" /> Queen Elizabeth II loaned a copy of the [[Magna Carta]] for the exhibition. It was her first visit to the United States since assuming the throne.\n\nThe 1957 Jamestown Festival was so successful that tourists still kept coming long after the official event was completed. Jamestown became a permanent attraction of the [[Historic Triangle]], and has been visited by families, school groups, tours, and thousands of other people continuously ever since.\n<!--For the 300th anniversary of the settlement in 1907, transportation considerations at the isolated location did not even bring Jamestown into serious contention as the venue for its own celebration. Instead, the [[Jamestown Exposition]] was held 25 miles away, at [[Sewell's Point]] on [[Hampton Roads]] in the former [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]].\n\nBy 1957, a lot of things had changed since 1907. During [[World War I]], the Sewell's Point site of the Jamestown Exposition had become part of the massive [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the largest Navy Base in the world. That site was unavailable.\n\nIn the 1930s, the US [[National Park Service]] (NPS) had acquired the rest of the land at Jamestown Island, and turned it over to the [[Colonial National Historical Park]]. Portions of the NPS's bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] had been completed between [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].\n\nFor the 350th anniversary, plans were made for Jamestown to host its own celebration. In anticipation, the remaining portion of the Colonial Parkway linking Jamestown to the other two points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]] was rushed to completion. For vehicular access, the [[isthmus]] linking the island to the mainland was restored by the NPS as part of the Colonial Parkway project. The [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] relocated the [[Glass House Point]] landing for the [[Jamestown Ferry]] and created the [[Jamestown Festival Park]] on adjacent land to the isthmus leading to the island (or peninsula) itself. Replicas of the three ships which had brought the original colonists were built, and placed on display.\n\nThe 1957 Jamestown Festival celebration was a huge success. Among many notable events, it featured a visit by U.S. Vice-President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and a state visit by Queen [[Elizabeth II of Great Britain]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. After 1957, tourism and interest in Jamestown became continuous, with both the state and the NPS's Colonial National Historical Park maintaining their complementary year-round attractions.-->\n\n===400th anniversary: Jamestown 2007===\n{{main|Jamestown 2007}}\n {{multiple image\n  | width   = 150\n  | footer  = Coins released in commemoration of the 400th anniversary\n  | image1  = Virginia quarter, reverse side, 2000.jpg\n  | alt1   =\n  | caption1 = Virginia [[State Quarters|State Quarter]] (Reverse)\n  | image2  = Jtsdobv.JPG\n  | alt2   =\n  | caption2 = [[Obverse and reverse|Obverse]] of [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary silver dollar]], the \"Three Faces of Diversity\" of Jamestown\n  | image3 = Jtg5dobv.JPG\n  | caption3 = Obverse of the [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary gold five dollar coin]]\n }}\nEarly in the 21st century, new accommodations, transportation facilities and attractions were planned in preparation for the quadricentennial of the founding of Jamestown. Numerous events were promoted under the banner of [[America's 400th Anniversary]] and promoted by the Jamestown 2007 Commission. The commemoration included 18 months of statewide, national and international festivities and events, which began in April 2006 with a tour of the new replica ''Godspeed''.\n\nIn January 2007, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] held a session at Jamestown. On May 4, 2007, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] attended a ceremony commemorating the 400th anniversary of the settlement's arrivals, reprising the honor they paid in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/05/nqueen05.xml |title=Telegraph Dead Link |accessdate=April 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005150345/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F05%2F05%2Fnqueen05.xml |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Virginia State Quarter, Jamestown was also the subject of two [[United States commemorative coin]]s celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement.
