[[List of snooker player nicknames|Nicknamed]] \"The Whirlwind\" because of his fluid, attacking style of play and popularly referred to as the \"People's Champion\", White is the [[IBSF World Snooker Championship|1980 World Amateur Champion]], [[2009 Six-red World Grand Prix|2009 Six-red World champion]], [[2010 World Seniors Championship|2010]] and [[2019 World Seniors Championship|2019 World Seniors Champion]], [[2019 Seniors 6-Red World Championship|2019 Seniors 6-Red World Champion]] and [[World Doubles Championship|1984 World Doubles champion]] with [[Alex Higgins]].\n\nWhite has won two of snooker's [[Triple Crown (snooker)|three majors]]: the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] (in 1992) and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] (in 1984) and a total of ten ranking events; he is currently [[List of snooker players by number of ranking titles|tenth on the all-time list of ranking event winners]]. He reached six [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] finals but never won the event; the closest he came was in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]] when he lost in a final frame decider against [[Stephen Hendry]]. He spent 21 seasons ranked in snooker's elite top 16. In team events, he won the [[Nations Cup (snooker)|Nations Cup]] and the [[World Cup (snooker)|World Cup]] with England. He is one of a select number of players to have made [[Century break|over 300-century breaks in professional competition]]. White was also the first left-handed player, and the second player overall, to record a [[maximum break]] at the World Championship.\n\n==Early life==\nWhite was born in Streathbourne Road, [[Tooting]], London, England, and studied at Ernest Bevin comprehensive. He never achieved academic success, as he was often [[Truancy|truant]] from school from the age of eight or nine, spending more and more time at \"Zans\", Ted Zanoncelli's [[Billiard hall|snooker hall]].  The club was affectionately known as \"Zans\" and after Ted's death in 1978 it was handed down to his daughter. It was around this time that White met [[Tony Meo]] with whom he would compete in [[hustling|money matches]] in many venues.<ref name=\"behind the\"/> His natural aptitude for snooker led to a successful amateur career. After winning the [[English Amateur Championship]] in 1979, a year later he became the youngest ever winner of the World Amateur Snooker Championship, aged 18, a record since surpassed by Stephen O'Connor [[Ian Preece]] and [[Hossein Vafaei]].\n\n==Career==\nWith a host of major titles and achievements, including ten ranking tournaments, White's overall record ranks him well up the list of snooker's most successful players. The BBC describes him as a \"legend\".<ref name=\"BBCWhirl\">{{cite news|title=Whirlwind Q&A|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6572815.stm|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=20 April 2007}}</ref> A left-hander, he reached the World Professional Championship Final on six occasions (1984, 1990\u20131994) but failed to win the sport's most prestigious title since his first attempt in 1981. Nonetheless, his consistency waned in the 2000s and a first-round defeat in the 2006 World Championship saw White drop out of the world's top 32 [[Snooker world rankings|player rankings]]. White's continued slide down the rankings saw him drop to 65th but he recovered slightly to move up to no. 56 for the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]]. White is one of only six players to have completed a [[maximum break]] at the [[Crucible Theatre]], doing so in the [[1992 World Snooker Championship]]. He has compiled more than 300-century breaks during his career.<ref name=\"Jimmy White on Ronnie\">{{cite news|title=Jimmy White on Ronnie O'Sullivan, his snooker future and visit to Norwich | url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/jimmy_white_on_ronnie_o_sullivan_his_snooker_future_and_visit_to_norwich_1_3284988 | newspaper=Eastern Daily Press| date=5 February 2014|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1980\u20131991===\nIn March 1976, White won the London & Home Counties section of the British Boys Championship, beating R Marsh 2\u20130, Neal Foulds 2\u20130 and Danny Adds 2\u20130 but did not win the Championship proper. In February 1977, he played a three frame exhibition with Alex Higgins at the Services rendered Club in Balham and the in the following month, still aged fourteen, beat Willie Thorne (giving him fourteen points start) 2\u20130 and Tony Meo 2\u20131, making a break of 103 against the latter at the Pot Black Snooker Club, Wandsworth. He lost to Meo in the inaugural Pontins junior tournament 2\u20133, on a fluked re-spotted black (having previously beaten Mike Hallett) but won the British Boys (U-16) Championships, beating D Dunn, K Green, and in the final, David Bonney. He then lost in the quarter-finals of the Warners Open to Brian Watson 1\u20133 and Bob Harris in the final of the Colchester Billiards Club Jubilee Competition. In the London & Home Counties Jubilee Championships, he fell in the last sixteen to Steve Davis 1\u20132 (Davis won the event) and lost to John Virgo 1\u20135 in the quarter-finals of the \u00a31000 Handicap at the Northern Snooker Centre, Leeds, having beaten Roy Hirst 4\u20132 and then Thorne 5\u20132 in the previous round. In November, he suffered a first-round defeat to Mike Hallett in the Billy Hill Trophy 3\u20135 and was defeated by Cliff Wilson 4\u20135 in an invitation tournament held at the Louth Town and Country Club.\n\nHe unexpectedly lost to Danny Adds in the London area qualifying of the 1978 British Boys Championships but reached the semi-finals of the \"Spot a Champion\" junior event at Fisher's, Acton, losing to Mike Hallett 0\u20134, having beaten C. Cinque 3\u20130 and Colin Morton 3\u20131. In the first round against A Allen, he won 3\u20130 with breaks of 119 and 97. In April 1978, he won the Wandsworth Classic out of eight seven-player groups. He beat Meo in the quarter-finals, Dickie Laws in the semis and won the title beating George Gibson 3\u20130. He followed this up by winning the Pontins junior title, beating John Bennett 3\u20132 in the final though he lost in the last 32 of the main Open, to Ian Williamson 2\u20134 having beaten Stan Holden in an earlier round. After having beaten Henry West (his manager), G Harkness and S Coughlin (all by 3\u20130), Steve Davis ended White's hope in the Warners Open, in the last sixteen. He suffered two defeats to Joe Johnson, the first in the quarter-finals of the Manchester Classic and the other in the first round of the Lucania Masters. He won the Meirlodge tournament staged at Fisher's, Wimbledon where all rounds up to the final were decided over the accumulated scores of three frames (Bob Coats, Paul Browne, George Campbell, Des Coyle and Mike Darrington were his victims). In the final, he defeated Geoff Foulds 3\u20132. He was beaten by Billy Kelly 2\u20134 in the Moorthorpe Recreation Invitation, at Doncaster but his biggest success to date came in October when he triumphed in the Pontins Autumn Open out of 338 entries. Wins over Eddie Sinclair, Peter Laws, J. Quartermain, Cliff Wilson, Tony Meo saw him to the final where he beat Sid Hood 7\u20136.\n\nDecember saw White lose out to Hallett again, in the \"Pot Red\" tournament, this time 1\u20133 (he had beaten Terry Whithread 4\u20131 in a group match) and then losing to K Kruck in the quarter-finals of the London & Home Counties Individual 1\u20132. He had a good run in the Castle Open, Southampton, reaching the 5th round before losing to Dennis Taylor 3\u20134. He had beaten Wally Broomfield, D Clark, Jack Karnehm and David Taylor. He lost to Brian Graham 2\u20133 in the 1st round of the Websters Pennine Open but beat professionals David Taylor, Doug Mountjoy and Jim Meadowcroft in the Gus Demmy Invitational before losing to John Virgo 4\u20135. David Taylor gained revenge when knocking White out of the Invitation tournament at Louth Town & Country Club 5\u20133.\n\nWhite's greatest achievement of his young career was in winning the English Amateur Championships. In the London Section, he beat M Goodchild 4\u20130, D Asbury 4\u20133, R Birt 4\u20130, Tony Meo 4\u20132 in the semi-finals and Danny Adds 4\u20131 in the final. This took him to the Southern Area proper where he beat Mark Wildman 4\u20133, Meirion Williams 4\u20133, George Eaton 5\u20133 and Cliff Wilson 8\u20135 in the final. Dave Martin, who won the Northern Section, was beaten 13\u201310 in the final itself. He suffered a couple of unexpected losses after this \u2013 to Walt Ley in the Westward Ho! Open semi-final, 2\u20133 and to Dave Gilbert, 2\u20133, in the London Final of the British Junior (U-19) Championships 1\u20133 (White made a break of 105 in an earlier round). He came roaring back, however, by retaining the Wandsworth Classic beating Tony O'Beirne, Wally West and Dave Gilbert in the last three rounds and also reaching the final of the Pontins Spring Open (out of 1034 entries), beating Doug Mountjoy 4\u20131, Neville Suthers 4\u20131, John Howell 4\u20130 and Paul Medati 4\u20131 before losing 3\u20137 to Steve Davis, despite Davis giving White thirty points start per frame! He was knocked out of the 1st round of the Pontins junior competition by John Carney, albeit over one frame! In the Lucania Junior Masters, he was beaten on frame countback but showed his class to reach the final of the Warners Open, losing to Tony Meo 2\u20135, having beaten John Law, John Virgo and Nick Fairall. Steve Davis beat him again, this time 4\u20130 in the North Ormesby Invitation (after having beaten Willie Thorne 4\u20130 in the quarter-final) and then lost in the next three tournaments to Dennis Hughes 1\u20135 (Demmy Manchester Classic), B Jones (Pontins Autumn Open) and Roy Connor. In the Canadian Open, he defeated Tony Knowles 9\u20135 but lost 3\u20139 to Steve Davis in the last 16.\n\n1980 opened with him winning the Demmy Pro-Am, defeating Tony Knowles 5\u20131, Willie Thorne 5\u20131, Dave Martin 5\u20131, Alex Higgins 5\u20133 and Steve Davis in the final 5\u20132. Higgins played the entire match wearing his Fedora hat! Davis got his own back by beating White in the semi-finals of the Invitation tournament at Louth Town & Country Club. Having beaten Thorne, again, 5\u20133, David pipped White 6\u20135. White made an unsuccessful defence of his English Amateur title when he lost to Mike Darrington in the semi-finals of the Southern Area, 5\u20138, having beaten Dave Gilbert 8\u20135 and Geoff Foulds 8\u20132. Tony Knowles beat him in an early round of the Pegasus Snooker Club Pro-Am 3\u20131 and he had to scratch for being late in the London & South Area of the British Junior Championships having earlier beaten Neal Foulds 3\u20131. Charlie Gay knocked him out of the Westward Ho! tournament 2\u20130 and in a qualifying round of the Pontins Spring Open, he lost to Maurice Suckling. Defeats to Greg Baxter, in an early round of the Heineken Lager Open and to Joe Johnson in the North Ormesby Invitation preceded a trip to the Canadian Open where he beat Vic Harris 9\u20138 before losing to Alex Higgins 7\u20139. He was also beaten by Dave Gilbert, 0\u20133, in the Lucania Masters.\n  \nWhite established himself as a top professional in 1981. After losing 8\u201310 to eventual champion [[Steve Davis]] in the first round of [[1981 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], White went on to win his first professional titles \u2013 the [[1981 Scottish Masters|Scottish Masters]] (defeating Cliff Thorburn in the final) and the [[1981 Northern Ireland Classic|Northern Ireland Classic]] (defeating Davis).\n\nThe World Championship has provided the theatre for White's greatest disappointments. In [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]], he led [[Alex Higgins]] 15\u201314 in their semi-final, was up 59\u20130 in the penultimate {{Cuegloss|Frame|frame}} and was a {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red}} and {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour}} away from the final. After missing a red with the rest, however, he could only watch as Higgins compiled a frame-winning 69 break. Higgins won the deciding frame that followed to reach the final.\n\nIn 1984 White won the [[1984 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] for the only time to date, beating [[Terry Griffiths]] 9\u20135 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jimmy White|url=http://harveylisberg.com/jimmy-white/|website=Harvey Lisberg \u2013 official website|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> He followed this success by reaching his first [[1984 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] final. Trailing Steve Davis 4\u201312 after the first two sessions, White responded by reducing the deficit to 15\u201316.  He then made an aggressive clearance of 65 to take the score to 16\u201317, but was unable to build upon a 40-point lead in the following frame, and lost 16\u201318. White did, however, become a World Doubles Champion later that year when he and Alex Higgins defeated [[Willie Thorne]] and [[Cliff Thorburn]] 10\u20132 in the final of the [[World Doubles Championship]].\n\nIn 1986 White reached his second [[1986 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] final, but was defeated by [[Cliff Thorburn]]. However, he won the [[1986 Classic (snooker)|Classic]] and also retained the [[1986 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] title he won in 1985. White won the Classic when he beat Thorburn in the final frame after needing a snooker. Later in the year, he overcame veteran [[Rex Williams]] 10\u20136 to win his first [[1986 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] title.\n\nWhite's third-ranking win \u2013 the [[1987 British Open]] \u2013 helped him to end the [[Snooker season 1986/1987|1986/1987 season]] as World number 2, behind Steve Davis who defeated him 16\u201311 in the semi-finals of the [[1987 World Snooker Championship|1987 World Championship]]. Later that year White and Davis contested a memorable [[1987 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] final which Davis won 16\u201314.\n\nIn 1988 he defeated John Campbell, [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] to reach his fourth [[1988 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] semi-final. He played Terry Griffiths and, trailing 11\u201313, lost a tied frame on a respotted black. Griffiths went on to reach the final courtesy of a 16\u201311 win. White did at least manage to consolidate his number-2 world ranking. However the [[Snooker season 1988/1989|1988/1989 season]] was less successful, and White's ranking slipped. He trailed [[John Virgo]] 11\u201312 in the second round of the [[1989 World Snooker Championship|1989 World Championship]] and looked beaten when his opponent was on a break of 26 in the following frame. Virgo, however, called a foul on himself and White was able to win 13\u201312. The reprieve was short-lived as White was soundly beaten 7\u201313 by eventual finalist [[John Parrott]] in the quarter-finals. White avenged this defeat later in the year by beating Parrott 18\u20139 in the final of the invitational [[1989 World Matchplay (snooker)|World Matchplay]].\n\nIn 1990, White recorded a 16\u201314 victory over Steve Davis in the semi-finals of the [[1990 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. It was Davis's first defeat in the event in four years. White subsequently lost his second World Championship final 12\u201318 to Stephen Hendry. However, White beat Hendry 18\u20139 to retain his [[1990 World Matchplay (snooker)|World Matchplay]] title later in the year and that win was followed by a 10\u20134 victory over Hendry (after leading 9\u20130) in the final of the [[1991 Classic (snooker)|1991 Classic]].  White continued his run of success with victory in the short-lived [[World Masters]], beating [[Tony Drago]] 10\u20136 in the final.\n\n[[Steve James (snooker player)|Steve James]] ended Hendry's reign as World Champion in the [[1991 World Snooker Championship|1991 World Championship]] and White, in turn, defeated James to reach the final. He played John Parrott and was whitewashed in the first session 0\u20137.  Although White managed to close the gap to 7\u201311, Parrott was able to seal an 18\u201311 victory. Parrott then overcame White 16\u201313 to win the [[1991 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] later in 1991.\n\n===1992\u20132002===\nWhite started 1992 positively and picked up his second [[1992 British Open|British Open]] title, beating Steve Davis in the semi-finals and [[James Wattana]] in the final. He won another ranking title, the [[1992 European Open (snooker)|European Open]], shortly after.\n\nWhite was drawn against Tony Drago in the first round of the [[1992 World Snooker Championship|1992 World Championship]]. After opening up an 8\u20134 lead, White made history in the 13th frame by becoming only the second player to make a [[maximum break]] in the World Championship. He won \u00a3100,000 in prize money for this achievement. Close wins over [[Alain Robidoux]] and [[Jim Wych]] followed before White met [[Alan McManus]] in the semi-finals, where he pulled away from 4\u20134 to win 16\u20137. He played Stephen Hendry in the final and won each of the first two sessions to open up a 10\u20136 lead, which he extended to 12\u20136 and 14\u20138. From 14\u20139, White lost three successive frames from commanding positions. At 14\u201312, White went {{Cuegloss|In-off|in-off}} when compiling a potentially frame-winning break. Hendry drew level at 14\u201314 without conceding a further {{Cuegloss|Point|point}} and won the closely contested 29th and 30th frames to lead 16\u201314. Two {{Cuegloss|Century|century}} {{Cuegloss|Break|breaks}} completed Hendry's ten-frame winning streak and a remarkable 18\u201314 victory.\n\nWhite responded well from this significant setback in the early part of the [[Snooker season 1992/1993|1992/1993 season]]. He defeated [[Ken Doherty]] 10\u20139 to claim his second [[1992 Grand Prix (snooker)|1992 Grand Prix]] title and followed this with an impressive victory in the [[1992 UK Championship (snooker)|1992 UK Championship]]. After defeating Alan McManus 9\u20137 in the semi-finals, White opened up a commanding 6\u20131 lead in the first session of the final against John Parrott, from where he secured a 16\u20139 win. White has stated that this was among the best matches he has ever played.<ref name=\"behind the\">{{cite book | last1 = White | first1 = Jimmy | last2= Kingsland |first2 = Rosemary | year = 1998 | title = Behind the White Ball: My Autobiography | publisher=Hutchinson | location = London | isbn = 0-09-180126-5}}</ref>\n\nHowever White toiled for the remainder of the season, and his struggles continued at the [[1993 World Snooker Championship|1993 World Championship]].  He did, however, manage to overcome [[Joe Swail]], [[Doug Mountjoy]] and [[Dennis Taylor]] to reach the semi-finals. White lost the first five frames of his semi-final with James Wattana but, from 2\u20136, he won 12 successive frames en route to a 16\u20139 victory. However he proved no match for Stephen Hendry in the final, and Hendry's century break in his first visit to the table proved portentous, as White was beaten 18\u20135 with a session to spare. Only John Parrott (in 1989) has suffered a heavier defeat in a World Championship final. White did, however, manage to end the season on a high note when he beat Alan McManus to win the [[Premier League Snooker|Matchroom League]].\n\nWhite endured a lacklustre campaign in the [[Snooker season 1993/1994|1993/1994 season]] but managed to reach the [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994 World Championship]] final for a fifth successive year, becoming only the second player after Steve Davis (1983\u201389) to achieve this. For the fourth time in five years, White's opponent in the final was Stephen Hendry and the defending champion opened up a 5\u20131 lead. White recovered well to lead 13\u201312 and made a break of 75 to take the match into a deciding frame. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading the frame by 37 points to 24 when he missed a straightforward black off its spot. Commentator [[Dennis Taylor]] memorably observed: \"Dear me, that was just a little bit of tension\". As it happened, Hendry cleared with a technically straightforward break of 58 to win the title. Gracious in defeat, White joked that Hendry was \"beginning to annoy\" him in the post-match interview.\n\nWhite's form continued to decline the [[Snooker season 1994/1995|following season]] and he failed to reach a ranking final. However, his results on the table were greatly overshadowed, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer during the season. He was able to make a successful recovery after having his left testicle removed. Shortly after, White underwent further surgery to correct his bald spot.<ref name=\"behind the\"/>\n\nAt the [[1995 World Snooker Championship|1995 World Championship]], White was involved in a controversial first-round match against South African [[Peter Francisco (snooker player)|Peter Francisco]]. From 2\u20132 White was able to pull away and win convincingly by 10 frames to 2. Shortly after it emerged that large sums of money had been placed on White to win the match by the eventual scoreline. The ensuing investigation found Francisco guilty of misconduct and banned him for five years. However no evidence was found against White, and he was completely cleared of any wrongdoing.<ref name=\"behind the\"/>\n\nWhite put this controversy behind him and overcame [[David Roe]] and John Parrott to reach his tenth World Championship semi-final. In his match with Stephen Hendry, White could only watch as the defending champion made a 147 break to go 8\u20134 in front. White recovered well to 7\u20138 and won three successive frames to reduce his arrears from 9\u201314 to 12\u201314. However, Hendry proved too strong and ran out a 16\u201312 win.\n\nWhite's ranking slipped from 7th to 13th at the end of the [[Snooker season 1995/1996|1995/1996 season]] and he was beaten 13\u201312 in a second-round encounter with [[Peter Ebdon]] in the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]]. White endured further personal problems later in 1996 with the deaths of his brother Martin and mother Lil. His mother's death caused him to pull out of the [[1996 Mosconi Cup]] pool competition.\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 1996/1997|1996/1997 season]] White failed to win a professional match until February and a first-round defeat at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]] against [[Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)|Anthony Hamilton]] (9\u201310, after leading 8\u20134) saw him drop out of the top-16 in the world rankings.\n\nA run to the semi-finals of the 1997 Grand Prix helped to remedy this and White then enjoyed a great form at the [[1998 World Snooker Championship|1998 World Championship]]. After qualifying to play Stephen Hendry in the first round, White opened with a century break and uncharacteristically shrewd matchplay enabled him to open up a 7\u20130 lead with only one further break over 50. Despite losing the next three frames from winning positions, White was able to seal a memorable 10\u20134 success and became the first player to beat Hendry twice at the World Championship. White followed this with a 13\u20133 win over [[Darren Morgan]] which included a break of 144. In his quarter-final against [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]], however, White reverted to his more familiar all-out attacking style and lost the first session 1\u20137.<ref name=\"behind the\"/> Although he fought back to 6\u20139, White succumbed to 7\u201313.\n\nAfter regaining his top-16 ranking in the [[Snooker season 1999/2000|1999/2000 season]] White started 2000 by reaching the semi-finals of the [[2000 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]], where he lost 5\u20136 to [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]], despite leading 4\u20131 at one point of the match. He then defeated [[Marco Fu]] and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2000 Masters (snooker)|Masters]], and he followed this up with a run to the quarter-finals of the [[2000 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. On both occasions, however, he was beaten by [[Matthew Stevens]]. Largely due to his poor form in the [[Snooker season 1998/1999|1998/1999 season]], White also lost his top-16 place. He fought back the [[Snooker season 2000/2001|following season]], reaching the final of the [[2000 British Open (snooker)|2000 British Open]] (losing 6\u20139 to Peter Ebdon) and the semi-finals of the [[2000 Grand Prix (snooker)|2000 Grand Prix]] in the early part of the campaign. His only other victory of note, however, was a 6\u20132 defeat of Ronnie O'Sullivan in the [[2001 Masters (snooker)|2001 Masters]] and White subsequently failed to qualify for the [[2001 World Snooker Championship|2001 World Championship]].\n\nRanked 11 at the start of the [[Snooker season 2001/2002|2001/2002 season]], White performed steadily in the ranking events without reaching a semi-final. In the invitational [[2002 Masters (snooker)|2002 Masters]] he beat Matthew Stevens 6\u20131 and came back from 2\u20135 behind to defeat O'Sullivan 6\u20135 in the quarter-finals. He similarly recovered from 2\u20135 down in his semi-final with [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] but lost 5\u20136. He lost 3\u201313 in his second-round match with Matthew Stevens at the [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002 World Championship]] and issued an immediate apology after hitting the cue ball off the table in frustration when trailing 2\u20135.\n\n===2003\u20132009===\nWhite won only two ranking event matches in the [[Snooker season 2002/2003|2002/2003 season]] but was able to maintain his top-16 ranking. He memorably came back from 1\u20135 down to defeat World Champion [[Peter Ebdon]] 6\u20135 in their first-round at the [[2003 Masters (snooker)|2003 Masters]].\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2003/2004|2003/2004 season]] White produced his most consistent season in over a decade. After reaching the semi-finals of the [[2003 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] in November 2003, White defeated [[Neil Robertson (snooker player)|Neil Robertson]], Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon to reach the semi-finals of the [[2004 Masters (snooker)|2004 Masters]] \u2013 where he lost a tight match against Ronnie O'Sullivan. White followed this up with further victories over Hendry and Robertson en route to the final of the [[2004 European Open (snooker)|European Open]] in Malta, but was beaten 3\u20139 by world number 48 [[Stephen Maguire]]. His last ranking victory to date came in April 2004, when White defeated [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]], John Parrott, [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]], Peter Ebdon and [[Paul Hunter (snooker player)|Paul Hunter]] to win the [[Scottish Open (snooker)|Players Championship]] in Glasgow \u2013 his first ranking title in over 11 years. Victory in the [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004 World Championship]] could have given White the number-one ranking, but he was beaten 10\u20138 by qualifier [[Barry Pinches]] after leading 4\u20132.\n\nWhite's consistency diminished in the [[Snooker season 2004/2005|2004/2005 season]]. Although his ranking rose to number 8 he was unable to reach the quarter-finals of any ranking event. However, he made two more memorable comebacks in the [[2005 Masters (snooker)|2005 Masters]]. White trailed Matthew Stevens 2\u20135 in the first round and pulled back to 4\u20135 after needing two snookers in the ninth frame. White went on to win 6\u20135 and beat Stevens's compatriot Mark Williams by the same score in the quarter-finals after trailing 4\u20135. But White was soundly beaten 6\u20131 by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semi-finals.\n\nWhite fell out of the top-32 at the end of the [[Snooker season 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]] and has not regained this status to date. He lost in the first round of the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006 World Championship]], although he did beat Stephen Hendry, [[Ding Junhui]] and World Champion [[Graeme Dott]] to reach the final of the [[2006 Premier League Snooker|2006 Premier League]].\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2006/2007|2006/2007 season]] he qualified for only one ranking event, the [[2007 China Open (snooker)|2007 China Open]]. He had a walkover [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]] before he lost 1\u20135 against [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]]. After the season, he fell out of the top-48.\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2007/2008|2007/2008 season]] he won 7 of his 16 qualifying matches. He won 4 straight matches at the [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|2007 Grand Prix]] and finished in the third place of his group, thus not qualifying for the main draw. He won one match at the [[2008 Welsh Open (snooker)|2008 Welsh Open]] and two matches at the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008 World Championship]]. After the season, he fell out of the top-64 and remained on the tour only via the one year list.\n\nHe began the [[Snooker season 2008/2009|2008/2009 season]] by qualifying for the main draw of the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]] and the [[2008 Shanghai Masters]], but lost in the first round against [[Barry Hawkins]] 3\u20135 and [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]] 4\u20135 respectively. He won 4 of his next 7 qualifying matches (2 at the [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|2008 Grand Prix]] and at the [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|2008 UK Championship]]. After this he qualified for the main stage of the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|2009 Welsh Open]], but lost in the first round 1\u20135 against [[Ali Carter]]. He won his next qualifying match at the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|2009 World Championship]]. In the second qualifying round he defeated [[Vincent Muldoon]] 10\u20138, but lost his next match 8\u201310 against [[Andy Hicks]]. At the end of the season he has the provisional ranking of No. 56.\n\n===2009\u20132010===\nProvisionally ranked number 47 for the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]], White showed a surprising return to form at the start of the season when he reached the final of the [[World Series of Snooker 2009/2010#Champion of Champions Challenge|Champion of Champions Challenge]] in Killarney, eventually losing 1\u20135 to Shaun Murphy.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Series of Snooker \u2013 Champion of Champions Challenge |url=http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-professional-tournaments-word-series-09-10-killarney-main.asp |publisher=Global Snooker |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722092706/http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-professional-tournaments-word-series-09-10-killarney-main.asp |archivedate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref> His second tournament of the season was the [[2009 Six-red World Grand Prix|Sangsom 6-red World Grand Prix]] in Bangkok, Thailand.

[[snooker]] player who now competes with an invitational tour card. [[List of snooker player nicknames|Nicknamed]] \"The Whirlwind\" because of his fluid, attacking style of play and popularly referred to as the \"People's Champion\", White is the [[IBSF World Snooker Championship|1980 World Amateur Champion]], [[2009 Six-red World Grand Prix|2009 Six-red World champion]], [[2010 World Seniors Championship|2010]] and [[2019 World Seniors Championship|2019 World Seniors Champion]], [[2019 Seniors 6-Red World Championship|2019 Seniors 6-Red World Champion]] and [[World Doubles Championship|1984 World Doubles champion]] with [[Alex Higgins]].\n\nWhite has won two of snooker's [[Triple Crown (snooker)|three majors]]: the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] (in 1992) and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] (in 1984) and a total of ten ranking events; he is currently [[List of snooker players by number of ranking titles|tenth on the all-time list of ranking event winners]]. He reached six [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] finals but never won the event; the closest he came was in [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994]] when he lost in a final frame decider against [[Stephen Hendry]]. He spent 21 seasons ranked in snooker's elite top 16. In team events, he won the [[Nations Cup (snooker)|Nations Cup]] and the [[World Cup (snooker)|World Cup]] with England. He is one of a select number of players to have made [[Century break|over 300-century breaks in professional competition]]. White was also the first left-handed player, and the second player overall, to record a [[maximum break]] at the World Championship.\n\n==Early life==\nWhite was born in Streathbourne Road, [[Tooting]], London, England, and studied at Ernest Bevin comprehensive. He never achieved academic success, as he was often [[Truancy|truant]] from school from the age of eight or nine, spending more and more time at \"Zans\", Ted Zanoncelli's [[Billiard hall|snooker hall]].  The club was affectionately known as \"Zans\" and after Ted's death in 1978 it was handed down to his daughter. It was around this time that White met [[Tony Meo]] with whom he would compete in [[hustling|money matches]] in many venues.<ref name=\"behind the\"/> His natural aptitude for snooker led to a successful amateur career. After winning the [[English Amateur Championship]] in 1979, a year later he became the youngest ever winner of the World Amateur Snooker Championship, aged 18, a record since surpassed by [[Ian Preece]] and [[Hossein Vafaei]].\n\n==Career==\nWith a host of major titles and achievements, including ten ranking tournaments, White's overall record ranks him well up the list of snooker's most successful players. The BBC describes him as a \"legend\".<ref name=\"BBCWhirl\">{{cite news|title=Whirlwind Q&A|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6572815.stm|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=20 April 2007}}</ref> A left-hander, he reached the World Professional Championship Final on six occasions (1984, 1990\u20131994) but failed to win the sport's most prestigious title since his first attempt in 1981. Nonetheless, his consistency waned in the 2000s and a first-round defeat in the 2006 World Championship saw White drop out of the world's top 32 [[Snooker world rankings|player rankings]]. White's continued slide down the rankings saw him drop to 65th but he recovered slightly to move up to no. 56 for the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]]. White is one of only six players to have completed a [[maximum break]] at the [[Crucible Theatre]], doing so in the [[1992 World Snooker Championship]]. He has compiled more than 300-century breaks during his career.<ref name=\"Jimmy White on Ronnie\">{{cite news|title=Jimmy White on Ronnie O'Sullivan, his snooker future and visit to Norwich | url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/jimmy_white_on_ronnie_o_sullivan_his_snooker_future_and_visit_to_norwich_1_3284988 | newspaper=Eastern Daily Press| date=5 February 2014|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1980\u20131991===\nIn March 1976, White won the London & Home Counties section of the British Boys Championship, beating R Marsh 2\u20130, Neal Foulds 2\u20130 and Danny Adds 2\u20130 but did not win the Championship proper. In February 1977, he played a three frame exhibition with Alex Higgins at the Services rendered Club in Balham and the in the following month, still aged fourteen, beat Willie Thorne (giving him fourteen points start) 2\u20130 and Tony Meo 2\u20131, making a break of 103 against the latter at the Pot Black Snooker Club, Wandsworth. He lost to Meo in the inaugural Pontins junior tournament 2\u20133, on a fluked re-spotted black (having previously beaten Mike Hallett) but won the British Boys (U-16) Championships, beating D Dunn, K Green, and in the final, David Bonney. He then lost in the quarter-finals of the Warners Open to Brian Watson 1\u20133 and Bob Harris in the final of the Colchester Billiards Club Jubilee Competition. In the London & Home Counties Jubilee Championships, he fell in the last sixteen to Steve Davis 1\u20132 (Davis won the event) and lost to John Virgo 1\u20135 in the quarter-finals of the \u00a31000 Handicap at the Northern Snooker Centre, Leeds, having beaten Roy Hirst 4\u20132 and then Thorne 5\u20132 in the previous round. In November, he suffered a first-round defeat to Mike Hallett in the Billy Hill Trophy 3\u20135 and was defeated by Cliff Wilson 4\u20135 in an invitation tournament held at the Louth Town and Country Club.\n\nHe unexpectedly lost to Danny Adds in the London area qualifying of the 1978 British Boys Championships but reached the semi-finals of the \"Spot a Champion\" junior event at Fisher's, Acton, losing to Mike Hallett 0\u20134, having beaten C. Cinque 3\u20130 and Colin Morton 3\u20131. In the first round against A Allen, he won 3\u20130 with breaks of 119 and 97. In April 1978, he won the Wandsworth Classic out of eight seven-player groups. He beat Meo in the quarter-finals, Dickie Laws in the semis and won the title beating George Gibson 3\u20130. He followed this up by winning the Pontins junior title, beating John Bennett 3\u20132 in the final though he lost in the last 32 of the main Open, to Ian Williamson 2\u20134 having beaten Stan Holden in an earlier round. After having beaten Henry West (his manager), G Harkness and S Coughlin (all by 3\u20130), Steve Davis ended White's hope in the Warners Open, in the last sixteen. He suffered two defeats to Joe Johnson, the first in the quarter-finals of the Manchester Classic and the other in the first round of the Lucania Masters. He won the Meirlodge tournament staged at Fisher's, Wimbledon where all rounds up to the final were decided over the accumulated scores of three frames (Bob Coats, Paul Browne, George Campbell, Des Coyle and Mike Darrington were his victims). In the final, he defeated Geoff Foulds 3\u20132. He was beaten by Billy Kelly 2\u20134 in the Moorthorpe Recreation Invitation, at Doncaster but his biggest success to date came in October when he triumphed in the Pontins Autumn Open out of 338 entries. Wins over Eddie Sinclair, Peter Laws, J. Quartermain, Cliff Wilson, Tony Meo saw him to the final where he beat Sid Hood 7\u20136.\n\nDecember saw White lose out to Hallett again, in the \"Pot Red\" tournament, this time 1\u20133 (he had beaten Terry Whithread 4\u20131 in a group match) and then losing to K Kruck in the quarter-finals of the London & Home Counties Individual 1\u20132. He had a good run in the Castle Open, Southampton, reaching the 5th round before losing to Dennis Taylor 3\u20134. He had beaten Wally Broomfield, D Clark, Jack Karnehm and David Taylor. He lost to Brian Graham 2\u20133 in the 1st round of the Websters Pennine Open but beat professionals David Taylor, Doug Mountjoy and Jim Meadowcroft in the Gus Demmy Invitational before losing to John Virgo 4\u20135. David Taylor gained revenge when knocking White out of the Invitation tournament at Louth Town & Country Club 5\u20133.\n\nWhite's greatest achievement of his young career was in winning the English Amateur Championships. In the London Section, he beat M Goodchild 4\u20130, D Asbury 4\u20133, R Birt 4\u20130, Tony Meo 4\u20132 in the semi-finals and Danny Adds 4\u20131 in the final. This took him to the Southern Area proper where he beat Mark Wildman 4\u20133, Meirion Williams 4\u20133, George Eaton 5\u20133 and Cliff Wilson 8\u20135 in the final. Dave Martin, who won the Northern Section, was beaten 13\u201310 in the final itself. He suffered a couple of unexpected losses after this \u2013 to Walt Ley in the Westward Ho! Open semi-final, 2\u20133 and to Dave Gilbert, 2\u20133, in the London Final of the British Junior (U-19) Championships 1\u20133 (White made a break of 105 in an earlier round). He came roaring back, however, by retaining the Wandsworth Classic beating Tony O'Beirne, Wally West and Dave Gilbert in the last three rounds and also reaching the final of the Pontins Spring Open (out of 1034 entries), beating Doug Mountjoy 4\u20131, Neville Suthers 4\u20131, John Howell 4\u20130 and Paul Medati 4\u20131 before losing 3\u20137 to Steve Davis, despite Davis giving White thirty points start per frame! He was knocked out of the 1st round of the Pontins junior competition by John Carney, albeit over one frame! In the Lucania Junior Masters, he was beaten on frame countback but showed his class to reach the final of the Warners Open, losing to Tony Meo 2\u20135, having beaten John Law, John Virgo and Nick Fairall. Steve Davis beat him again, this time 4\u20130 in the North Ormesby Invitation (after having beaten Willie Thorne 4\u20130 in the quarter-final) and then lost in the next three tournaments to Dennis Hughes 1\u20135 (Demmy Manchester Classic), B Jones (Pontins Autumn Open) and Roy Connor. In the Canadian Open, he defeated Tony Knowles 9\u20135 but lost 3\u20139 to Steve Davis in the last 16.\n\n1980 opened with him winning the Demmy Pro-Am, defeating Tony Knowles 5\u20131, Willie Thorne 5\u20131, Dave Martin 5\u20131, Alex Higgins 5\u20133 and Steve Davis in the final 5\u20132. Higgins played the entire match wearing his Fedora hat! Davis got his own back by beating White in the semi-finals of the Invitation tournament at Louth Town & Country Club. Having beaten Thorne, again, 5\u20133, David pipped White 6\u20135. White made an unsuccessful defence of his English Amateur title when he lost to Mike Darrington in the semi-finals of the Southern Area, 5\u20138, having beaten Dave Gilbert 8\u20135 and Geoff Foulds 8\u20132. Tony Knowles beat him in an early round of the Pegasus Snooker Club Pro-Am 3\u20131 and he had to scratch for being late in the London & South Area of the British Junior Championships having earlier beaten Neal Foulds 3\u20131. Charlie Gay knocked him out of the Westward Ho! tournament 2\u20130 and in a qualifying round of the Pontins Spring Open, he lost to Maurice Suckling. Defeats to Greg Baxter, in an early round of the Heineken Lager Open and to Joe Johnson in the North Ormesby Invitation preceded a trip to the Canadian Open where he beat Vic Harris 9\u20138 before losing to Alex Higgins 7\u20139. He was also beaten by Dave Gilbert, 0\u20133, in the Lucania Masters.\n  \nWhite established himself as a top professional in 1981. After losing 8\u201310 to eventual champion [[Steve Davis]] in the first round of [[1981 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], White went on to win his first professional titles \u2013 the [[1981 Scottish Masters|Scottish Masters]] (defeating Cliff Thorburn in the final) and the [[1981 Northern Ireland Classic|Northern Ireland Classic]] (defeating Davis).\n\nThe World Championship has provided the theatre for White's greatest disappointments. In [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]], he led [[Alex Higgins]] 15\u201314 in their semi-final, was up 59\u20130 in the penultimate {{Cuegloss|Frame|frame}} and was a {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red}} and {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour}} away from the final. After missing a red with the rest, however, he could only watch as Higgins compiled a frame-winning 69 break. Higgins won the deciding frame that followed to reach the final.\n\nIn 1984 White won the [[1984 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] for the only time to date, beating [[Terry Griffiths]] 9\u20135 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jimmy White|url=http://harveylisberg.com/jimmy-white/|website=Harvey Lisberg \u2013 official website|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> He followed this success by reaching his first [[1984 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] final. Trailing Steve Davis 4\u201312 after the first two sessions, White responded by reducing the deficit to 15\u201316.  He then made an aggressive clearance of 65 to take the score to 16\u201317, but was unable to build upon a 40-point lead in the following frame, and lost 16\u201318. White did, however, become a World Doubles Champion later that year when he and Alex Higgins defeated [[Willie Thorne]] and [[Cliff Thorburn]] 10\u20132 in the final of the [[World Doubles Championship]].\n\nIn 1986 White reached his second [[1986 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] final, but was defeated by [[Cliff Thorburn]]. However, he won the [[1986 Classic (snooker)|Classic]] and also retained the [[1986 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]] title he won in 1985. White won the Classic when he beat Thorburn in the final frame after needing a snooker. Later in the year, he overcame veteran [[Rex Williams]] 10\u20136 to win his first [[1986 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] title.\n\nWhite's third-ranking win \u2013 the [[1987 British Open]] \u2013 helped him to end the [[Snooker season 1986/1987|1986/1987 season]] as World number 2, behind Steve Davis who defeated him 16\u201311 in the semi-finals of the [[1987 World Snooker Championship|1987 World Championship]]. Later that year White and Davis contested a memorable [[1987 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] final which Davis won 16\u201314.\n\nIn 1988 he defeated John Campbell, [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]] to reach his fourth [[1988 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] semi-final. He played Terry Griffiths and, trailing 11\u201313, lost a tied frame on a respotted black. Griffiths went on to reach the final courtesy of a 16\u201311 win. White did at least manage to consolidate his number-2 world ranking. However the [[Snooker season 1988/1989|1988/1989 season]] was less successful, and White's ranking slipped. He trailed [[John Virgo]] 11\u201312 in the second round of the [[1989 World Snooker Championship|1989 World Championship]] and looked beaten when his opponent was on a break of 26 in the following frame. Virgo, however, called a foul on himself and White was able to win 13\u201312. The reprieve was short-lived as White was soundly beaten 7\u201313 by eventual finalist [[John Parrott]] in the quarter-finals. White avenged this defeat later in the year by beating Parrott 18\u20139 in the final of the invitational [[1989 World Matchplay (snooker)|World Matchplay]].\n\nIn 1990, White recorded a 16\u201314 victory over Steve Davis in the semi-finals of the [[1990 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. It was Davis's first defeat in the event in four years. White subsequently lost his second World Championship final 12\u201318 to Stephen Hendry. However, White beat Hendry 18\u20139 to retain his [[1990 World Matchplay (snooker)|World Matchplay]] title later in the year and that win was followed by a 10\u20134 victory over Hendry (after leading 9\u20130) in the final of the [[1991 Classic (snooker)|1991 Classic]].  White continued his run of success with victory in the short-lived [[World Masters]], beating [[Tony Drago]] 10\u20136 in the final.\n\n[[Steve James (snooker player)|Steve James]] ended Hendry's reign as World Champion in the [[1991 World Snooker Championship|1991 World Championship]] and White, in turn, defeated James to reach the final. He played John Parrott and was whitewashed in the first session 0\u20137.  Although White managed to close the gap to 7\u201311, Parrott was able to seal an 18\u201311 victory. Parrott then overcame White 16\u201313 to win the [[1991 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] later in 1991.\n\n===1992\u20132002===\nWhite started 1992 positively and picked up his second [[1992 British Open|British Open]] title, beating Steve Davis in the semi-finals and [[James Wattana]] in the final. He won another ranking title, the [[1992 European Open (snooker)|European Open]], shortly after.\n\nWhite was drawn against Tony Drago in the first round of the [[1992 World Snooker Championship|1992 World Championship]]. After opening up an 8\u20134 lead, White made history in the 13th frame by becoming only the second player to make a [[maximum break]] in the World Championship. He won \u00a3100,000 in prize money for this achievement. Close wins over [[Alain Robidoux]] and [[Jim Wych]] followed before White met [[Alan McManus]] in the semi-finals, where he pulled away from 4\u20134 to win 16\u20137. He played Stephen Hendry in the final and won each of the first two sessions to open up a 10\u20136 lead, which he extended to 12\u20136 and 14\u20138. From 14\u20139, White lost three successive frames from commanding positions. At 14\u201312, White went {{Cuegloss|In-off|in-off}} when compiling a potentially frame-winning break. Hendry drew level at 14\u201314 without conceding a further {{Cuegloss|Point|point}} and won the closely contested 29th and 30th frames to lead 16\u201314. Two {{Cuegloss|Century|century}} {{Cuegloss|Break|breaks}} completed Hendry's ten-frame winning streak and a remarkable 18\u201314 victory.\n\nWhite responded well from this significant setback in the early part of the [[Snooker season 1992/1993|1992/1993 season]]. He defeated [[Ken Doherty]] 10\u20139 to claim his second [[1992 Grand Prix (snooker)|1992 Grand Prix]] title and followed this with an impressive victory in the [[1992 UK Championship (snooker)|1992 UK Championship]]. After defeating Alan McManus 9\u20137 in the semi-finals, White opened up a commanding 6\u20131 lead in the first session of the final against John Parrott, from where he secured a 16\u20139 win. White has stated that this was among the best matches he has ever played.<ref name=\"behind the\">{{cite book | last1 = White | first1 = Jimmy | last2= Kingsland |first2 = Rosemary | year = 1998 | title = Behind the White Ball: My Autobiography | publisher=Hutchinson | location = London | isbn = 0-09-180126-5}}</ref>\n\nHowever White toiled for the remainder of the season, and his struggles continued at the [[1993 World Snooker Championship|1993 World Championship]].  He did, however, manage to overcome [[Joe Swail]], [[Doug Mountjoy]] and [[Dennis Taylor]] to reach the semi-finals. White lost the first five frames of his semi-final with James Wattana but, from 2\u20136, he won 12 successive frames en route to a 16\u20139 victory. However he proved no match for Stephen Hendry in the final, and Hendry's century break in his first visit to the table proved portentous, as White was beaten 18\u20135 with a session to spare. Only John Parrott (in 1989) has suffered a heavier defeat in a World Championship final. White did, however, manage to end the season on a high note when he beat Alan McManus to win the [[Premier League Snooker|Matchroom League]].\n\nWhite endured a lacklustre campaign in the [[Snooker season 1993/1994|1993/1994 season]] but managed to reach the [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994 World Championship]] final for a fifth successive year, becoming only the second player after Steve Davis (1983\u201389) to achieve this. For the fourth time in five years, White's opponent in the final was Stephen Hendry and the defending champion opened up a 5\u20131 lead. White recovered well to lead 13\u201312 and made a break of 75 to take the match into a deciding frame. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading the frame by 37 points to 24 when he missed a straightforward black off its spot. Commentator [[Dennis Taylor]] memorably observed: \"Dear me, that was just a little bit of tension\". As it happened, Hendry cleared with a technically straightforward break of 58 to win the title. Gracious in defeat, White joked that Hendry was \"beginning to annoy\" him in the post-match interview.\n\nWhite's form continued to decline the [[Snooker season 1994/1995|following season]] and he failed to reach a ranking final. However, his results on the table were greatly overshadowed, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer during the season. He was able to make a successful recovery after having his left testicle removed. Shortly after, White underwent further surgery to correct his bald spot.<ref name=\"behind the\"/>\n\nAt the [[1995 World Snooker Championship|1995 World Championship]], White was involved in a controversial first-round match against South African [[Peter Francisco (snooker player)|Peter Francisco]]. From 2\u20132 White was able to pull away and win convincingly by 10 frames to 2. Shortly after it emerged that large sums of money had been placed on White to win the match by the eventual scoreline. The ensuing investigation found Francisco guilty of misconduct and banned him for five years. However no evidence was found against White, and he was completely cleared of any wrongdoing.<ref name=\"behind the\"/>\n\nWhite put this controversy behind him and overcame [[David Roe]] and John Parrott to reach his tenth World Championship semi-final. In his match with Stephen Hendry, White could only watch as the defending champion made a 147 break to go 8\u20134 in front. White recovered well to 7\u20138 and won three successive frames to reduce his arrears from 9\u201314 to 12\u201314. However, Hendry proved too strong and ran out a 16\u201312 win.\n\nWhite's ranking slipped from 7th to 13th at the end of the [[Snooker season 1995/1996|1995/1996 season]] and he was beaten 13\u201312 in a second-round encounter with [[Peter Ebdon]] in the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]]. White endured further personal problems later in 1996 with the deaths of his brother Martin and mother Lil. His mother's death caused him to pull out of the [[1996 Mosconi Cup]] pool competition.\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 1996/1997|1996/1997 season]] White failed to win a professional match until February and a first-round defeat at the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]] against [[Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)|Anthony Hamilton]] (9\u201310, after leading 8\u20134) saw him drop out of the top-16 in the world rankings.\n\nA run to the semi-finals of the 1997 Grand Prix helped to remedy this and White then enjoyed a great form at the [[1998 World Snooker Championship|1998 World Championship]]. After qualifying to play Stephen Hendry in the first round, White opened with a century break and uncharacteristically shrewd matchplay enabled him to open up a 7\u20130 lead with only one further break over 50. Despite losing the next three frames from winning positions, White was able to seal a memorable 10\u20134 success and became the first player to beat Hendry twice at the World Championship. White followed this with a 13\u20133 win over [[Darren Morgan]] which included a break of 144. In his quarter-final against [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]], however, White reverted to his more familiar all-out attacking style and lost the first session 1\u20137.<ref name=\"behind the\"/> Although he fought back to 6\u20139, White succumbed to 7\u201313.\n\nAfter regaining his top-16 ranking in the [[Snooker season 1999/2000|1999/2000 season]] White started 2000 by reaching the semi-finals of the [[2000 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]], where he lost 5\u20136 to [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]], despite leading 4\u20131 at one point of the match. He then defeated [[Marco Fu]] and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2000 Masters (snooker)|Masters]], and he followed this up with a run to the quarter-finals of the [[2000 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. On both occasions, however, he was beaten by [[Matthew Stevens]]. Largely due to his poor form in the [[Snooker season 1998/1999|1998/1999 season]], White also lost his top-16 place. He fought back the [[Snooker season 2000/2001|following season]], reaching the final of the [[2000 British Open (snooker)|2000 British Open]] (losing 6\u20139 to Peter Ebdon) and the semi-finals of the [[2000 Grand Prix (snooker)|2000 Grand Prix]] in the early part of the campaign. His only other victory of note, however, was a 6\u20132 defeat of Ronnie O'Sullivan in the [[2001 Masters (snooker)|2001 Masters]] and White subsequently failed to qualify for the [[2001 World Snooker Championship|2001 World Championship]].\n\nRanked 11 at the start of the [[Snooker season 2001/2002|2001/2002 season]], White performed steadily in the ranking events without reaching a semi-final. In the invitational [[2002 Masters (snooker)|2002 Masters]] he beat Matthew Stevens 6\u20131 and came back from 2\u20135 behind to defeat O'Sullivan 6\u20135 in the quarter-finals. He similarly recovered from 2\u20135 down in his semi-final with [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] but lost 5\u20136. He lost 3\u201313 in his second-round match with Matthew Stevens at the [[2002 World Snooker Championship|2002 World Championship]] and issued an immediate apology after hitting the cue ball off the table in frustration when trailing 2\u20135.\n\n===2003\u20132009===\nWhite won only two ranking event matches in the [[Snooker season 2002/2003|2002/2003 season]] but was able to maintain his top-16 ranking. He memorably came back from 1\u20135 down to defeat World Champion [[Peter Ebdon]] 6\u20135 in their first-round at the [[2003 Masters (snooker)|2003 Masters]].\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2003/2004|2003/2004 season]] White produced his most consistent season in over a decade. After reaching the semi-finals of the [[2003 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] in November 2003, White defeated [[Neil Robertson (snooker player)|Neil Robertson]], Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon to reach the semi-finals of the [[2004 Masters (snooker)|2004 Masters]] \u2013 where he lost a tight match against Ronnie O'Sullivan. White followed this up with further victories over Hendry and Robertson en route to the final of the [[2004 European Open (snooker)|European Open]] in Malta, but was beaten 3\u20139 by world number 48 [[Stephen Maguire]]. His last ranking victory to date came in April 2004, when White defeated [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]], John Parrott, [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]], Peter Ebdon and [[Paul Hunter (snooker player)|Paul Hunter]] to win the [[Scottish Open (snooker)|Players Championship]] in Glasgow \u2013 his first ranking title in over 11 years. Victory in the [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004 World Championship]] could have given White the number-one ranking, but he was beaten 10\u20138 by qualifier [[Barry Pinches]] after leading 4\u20132.\n\nWhite's consistency diminished in the [[Snooker season 2004/2005|2004/2005 season]]. Although his ranking rose to number 8 he was unable to reach the quarter-finals of any ranking event. However, he made two more memorable comebacks in the [[2005 Masters (snooker)|2005 Masters]]. White trailed Matthew Stevens 2\u20135 in the first round and pulled back to 4\u20135 after needing two snookers in the ninth frame. White went on to win 6\u20135 and beat Stevens's compatriot Mark Williams by the same score in the quarter-finals after trailing 4\u20135. But White was soundly beaten 6\u20131 by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semi-finals.\n\nWhite fell out of the top-32 at the end of the [[Snooker season 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]] and has not regained this status to date. He lost in the first round of the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006 World Championship]], although he did beat Stephen Hendry, [[Ding Junhui]] and World Champion [[Graeme Dott]] to reach the final of the [[2006 Premier League Snooker|2006 Premier League]].\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2006/2007|2006/2007 season]] he qualified for only one ranking event, the [[2007 China Open (snooker)|2007 China Open]]. He had a walkover [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]] before he lost 1\u20135 against [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]]. After the season, he fell out of the top-48.\n\nIn the [[Snooker season 2007/2008|2007/2008 season]] he won 7 of his 16 qualifying matches. He won 4 straight matches at the [[2007 Grand Prix (snooker)|2007 Grand Prix]] and finished in the third place of his group, thus not qualifying for the main draw. He won one match at the [[2008 Welsh Open (snooker)|2008 Welsh Open]] and two matches at the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008 World Championship]]. After the season, he fell out of the top-64 and remained on the tour only via the one year list.\n\nHe began the [[Snooker season 2008/2009|2008/2009 season]] by qualifying for the main draw of the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]] and the [[2008 Shanghai Masters]], but lost in the first round against [[Barry Hawkins]] 3\u20135 and [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]] 4\u20135 respectively. He won 4 of his next 7 qualifying matches (2 at the [[2008 Grand Prix (snooker)|2008 Grand Prix]] and at the [[2008 UK Championship (snooker)|2008 UK Championship]]. After this he qualified for the main stage of the [[2009 Welsh Open (snooker)|2009 Welsh Open]], but lost in the first round 1\u20135 against [[Ali Carter]]. He won his next qualifying match at the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|2009 World Championship]]. In the second qualifying round he defeated [[Vincent Muldoon]] 10\u20138, but lost his next match 8\u201310 against [[Andy Hicks]]. At the end of the season he has the provisional ranking of No. 56.\n\n===2009\u20132010===\nProvisionally ranked number 47 for the [[Snooker season 2009/2010|2009/10 season]], White showed a surprising return to form at the start of the season when he reached the final of the [[World Series of Snooker 2009/2010#Champion of Champions Challenge|Champion of Champions Challenge]] in Killarney, eventually losing 1\u20135 to Shaun Murphy.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Series of Snooker \u2013 Champion of Champions Challenge |url=http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-professional-tournaments-word-series-09-10-killarney-main.asp |publisher=Global Snooker |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722092706/http://www.global-snooker.com/global-snooker-professional-tournaments-word-series-09-10-killarney-main.asp |archivedate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref> His second tournament of the season was the [[2009 Six-red World Grand Prix|Sangsom 6-red World Grand Prix]] in Bangkok, Thailand.

Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nFort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County and Edmonton are across the North Saskatchewan River. The original fort was located one&nbsp;kilometer north-east of Lamoureux.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Agrium]] and [[Shell Canada]].
