The network is among the few online channels to generate more than 1&nbsp;billion views since launching on YouTube, which does not market a channel on the Roku app store. Young Turks COO Steve Oh acknowledged that making the TYT Network available on Roku was the first part of a strategy to continue the network's growth, regardless of what medium in which its viewers are watching its content, with the intent to figure out a way to monetize its programming through multiple distribution channels, rather than relying on one or two larger channels (such as YouTube or cable television distribution). The network also announced plans to unveil native apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Oh also noted that the network's representatives were speaking with other media platforms about expanding its programming.\n\nIn April 2014, ''The Young Turks'' began offering its content on [[Hulu]]. With this, it began providing a condensed 30-minute version of the program featuring excerpts from the full two-hour daily show, along with a 30-minute weekly version of its daily pop-culture show ''PopTrigger'', with other shows being added shortly afterward. Oh stated on the Hulu launch that, \"as TYT Network has grown from a single show to an entire network, we've consistently found ways to bring our shows to more people[..] We've long admired Hulu as a leader of online video and both parties saw an opportunity to bring digitally-native politics and pop culture talk shows to Hulu's audience.\" He also stated that the company is pitching shows to cable network, but had no immediate plans to revive a television broadcast as either a relaunched program or a show similar in format to the one it formerly produced for Current TV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cenk Uygur's Young Turks Network launches shows on Hulu |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |first=Ryan |last=Faughnder |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Publishing |date=March 24, 2014 |access-date=May 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035048/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |archive-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe website's yearly revenue was roughly US$3&nbsp;million in 2013.

It was filmed at studio facilities in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].\n\nCurrent TV announced the launch of a separate television broadcast of ''The Young Turks'' on September 20, 2011, with the program intending to air Monday through Friday evenings at 7:00&nbsp;pm. Eastern Time beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was the second news and opinion program to air on Current, alongside ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', and was part of a strategy to refocus the network's prime time schedule around progressive talk programming (which was followed by the debut of ''[[The War Room with Jennifer Granholm]]'' in January 2012). According to the show's website, the show was titled ''The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur'' to differentiate itself from the popular web series.<ref name=\"CurrTV\">{{cite web |title=The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur |url=http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |website=Current TV |access-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807205849/http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For two years, the two separate shows were produced each Monday through Thursday, with a one-hour break between the production airtimes of the television and web shows.

The network is among the few online channels to generate more than 1&nbsp;billion views since launching on YouTube, which does not market a channel on the Roku app store. Young Turks COO Steve Oh acknowledged that making the TYT Network available on Roku was the first part of a strategy to continue the network's growth, regardless of what medium in which its viewers are watching its content, with the intent to figure out a way to monetize its programming through multiple distribution channels, rather than relying on one or two larger channels (such as YouTube or cable television distribution). The network also announced plans to unveil native apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Oh also noted that the network's representatives were speaking with other media platforms about expanding its programming.\n\nIn April 2014, ''The Young Turks'' began offering its content on [[Hulu]]. With this, it began providing a condensed 30-minute version of the program featuring excerpts from the full two-hour daily show, along with a 30-minute weekly version of its daily pop-culture show ''PopTrigger'', with other shows being added shortly afterward. Oh stated on the Hulu launch that, \"as TYT Network has grown from a single show to an entire network, we've consistently found ways to bring our shows to more people[..] We've long admired Hulu as a leader of online video and both parties saw an opportunity to bring digitally-native politics and pop culture talk shows to Hulu's audience.\" He also stated that the company is pitching shows to cable network, but had no immediate plans to revive a television broadcast as either a relaunched program or a show similar in format to the one it formerly produced for Current TV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cenk Uygur's Young Turks Network launches shows on Hulu |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |first=Ryan |last=Faughnder |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Publishing |date=March 24, 2014 |access-date=May 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315035048/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-the-young-turks-network-launches-shows-on-hulu-20140321-story.html |archive-date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe website's yearly revenue was roughly US$3&nbsp;million in 2013.

It was filmed at studio facilities in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].\n\nCurrent TV announced the launch of a separate television broadcast of ''The Young Turks'' on September 20, 2011, with the program intending to air Monday through Friday evenings at 7:00&nbsp;pm. Eastern Time beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. It was the second news and opinion program to air on Current, alongside ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', and was part of a strategy to refocus the network's prime time schedule around progressive talk programming (which was followed by the debut of ''[[The War Room with Jennifer Granholm]]'' in January 2012). According to the show's website, the show was titled ''The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur'' to differentiate itself from the popular web series.<ref name=\"CurrTV\">{{cite web |title=The Young Turks with Cenk Uygur |url=http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |website=Current TV |access-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807205849/http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/ |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For two years, the two separate shows were produced each Monday through Thursday, with a one-hour break between the production airtimes of the television and web shows.

Originating around 1789 as a small trading community inhabited by the [[Neutral Nation]] near the mouth of [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]], the city, then a town, grew quickly after the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, with the city at its western terminus. Its position at the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]] strengthened the economy, based on [[Gristmill|grain milling]] and [[Steelmaking|steel production]] along the southern shores and in nearby [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]].\n\nIn the dawn of the 20th century, Buffalo was one of the most populous cities in the United States. It had hosted the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901 and later became a center for the [[Automotive industry in the United States|automotive industry]].\n\nLater, the opening of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] combined with the effects of [[suburbanization]], [[deindustrialization]], and [[globalization]] led to the decline of the city's chief industries. The city lost over half of its population from 1950 to 2010. Buffalo retains many industries and has developed a diverse economy based upon advanced manufacturing, healthcare and education.\n\n==Origin of name==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\n{{US Census population\n| 1830= 8668\n| 1840= 18213\n| 1850= 42261\n| 1860= 81129\n| 1870= 117714\n| 1880= 155134\n| 1890= 255664\n| 1900= 352387\n| 1910= 423715\n| 1920= 506775\n| 1930= 573076\n| 1940= 575901\n| 1950= 580132\n| 1960= 532759\n| 1970= 462768\n| 1980= 357870\n| 1990= 328123\n| 2000= 292648\n| 2010= 261310\n| footnote=source:<ref name=\"census\">[https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html US Population of the 100 Largest Cities and other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314031958/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html |date=2007-03-14 }} [[Census.gov]]</ref>\n}}\n[[Image:Buffalo, New York from I-190 North entering downtown.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Buffalo 2006]][[File:Buffalo 1813.jpg|thumb|300px|Buffalo in 1813<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=380}}</ref>]]\nThe City of Buffalo, formerly known as Buffalo Creek, received its name from the [[stream|creek]] that flows through it. However, the origin of the creek's name is unclear, with several unproven theories existing. Early French explorers reported the abundance of [[American Bison|buffalo]] on the Eastern shore of Lake Erie, but their presence on the banks of [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] is still a matter of debate, although American Bison did range into western NY state at one time. Neither the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name ''Teyohoseroron'' (the Place of the Basswoods) nor the French name ''Riviere aux Chevaux'' (River of Horses) survived, so the current name likely dates to the British occupation which began with the capture of [[Fort Niagara]] in 1759.\n\nAnother theory holds that a [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] Indian lived there, either whose name meant buffalo, or who had the physical characteristics of a buffalo, and was translated as such by the English settlers. The stream where he lived became Buffalo's Creek. Unlike other nearby creeks such as Scajaquada Creek and Smoke's Creek which were named after actual historic figures, there is no known reference to any Native American named Buffalo. Also given credence by local historians at one time was the possibility that an interpreter mistranslated the Native American word for \"[[beaver]]\" as \"buffalo,\" the words being very similar, at a treaty-signing at present-day [[Rome, New York]] in 1784. The theory assumes that because there were beaver here, the creek was probably called Beaver Creek rather than Buffalo Creek.[[Image:Buffalo Panorama 1911.jpg|thumb|400px|Buffalo panorama circa 1911]]Another theory holds that the name is an [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] form of the [[France|French]] name ''Beau Fleuve'' (beautiful river), which was supposedly an exclamation uttered by [[Louis Hennepin]] when he first saw the Niagara River. This is a relatively recently proposed theory (1909) and is unlikely, as no period sources contain this quote. The earliest known name origin theory is an anecdote told to Captain Daniel Dobbins by Cornelius Winney in 1795 and also found with variations in Sheldon Ball's History of Buffalo (1825) and other sources, about a party of hunters whose guide shoots a horse and passes it off as bison meat, thereafter the origin of the term \"buffaloed.\"\n\nDespite many years of speculation and garbling of previous debate, more recently available sources indicate that the name Buffalo Creek was in common use on the Niagara Frontier by 1764, as [[John Montresor]] referenced 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of that year.<ref name=Montresor_BuffaloCreek>{{cite book |title=Buffalo Historical Society Publications |chapter=The Achievements of Captain John Montresor |author=Severance, Frank H. |editor=Buffalo Historical Society |location=Buffalo, NY |date=1902 |publisher=Bigelow Brothers |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBs8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA15 |page=15 |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> The name may have originated with an English speaking person sometime between 1759 and 1764, possibly after seeing animal bones, thought to be bison but possibly elk or moose or domesticated cattle, at the salt lick called Sour Springs located at the head of navigation about 6 miles up the creek.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n===Amerindian Crossroads===\nThe societies of the Native Forest dwellers we know as Native Americans, Amerindians, or First Nations made highways of the Great Lakes, streams and were far more social than their reputed penchant for warfare, cruelty, and collecting scalps would suggest. Their canoes were built from lightweight birch bark, or far more often, Elm, the farther south the tribe, the more likely Elm was the material used for many purposes including the canoes. Buffalo, near the throat of the Niagara River, was a popular campsite for voyaging tribesmen, in a culture which often went on walk-abouts, touring neighboring lands and conducting the widespread practice of boy-meets-girl, trading of regional commodities.{{efn\n  | Obsidian from Canada, Flint, shells, plants are all known to have traveled hundreds-to-thousands of miles carried by a sociable people that often met recreationally as well for competitions&mdash;for [[Lacrosse]]&mdash;the picture of the Amerindian tribes as blood thirsty savages would never have lasted in the light of day, had the natives not been cut down by diseases they had little resistance to.\n  }} \n[[Image:Wenro-Territorium um 1630.png|thumb|left|320px<!--\n\n--->|alt=:Wenro-Territorium um 1630.png|1630s: The French report the '''Wenro''''s territory was north and east of the [[Erie people]]s, East of the [[Neutral people]] across the [[Niagara River]] and west of the [[Genesee River]] valley and the ''Genesee Gorge'' across which the Seneca people had their home.]]\nPrior to European colonization by French settlers, the region's inhabitants were an [[Iroquoian language|Iroquoian-speaking]] tribal offshoot called the [[Wenro people]] or'' 'Wenrohronon','' who lived along the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its southern shore. The population of the Wenro was small by comparison to other Iroquoian tribes the French encountered and reported upon, possibly because they'd only recently split off from other groups or because they'd suffered the misfortunes of war. They were possibly (most likely) a sub-group of the main [[Neutral Nation|''Neutral Confederacy'']] which had colonized the opposite shore, or possibly relatives of the great abutting neighboring [[Erie Nation]],{{efn \n  | It is also possible they were a combination of clan groups from differing peoples.

Either way, by 300 years later the various Iroquoian peoples dominated the area of the right bank St. Lawrence River to the Eastern side of [[Lake Huron]] dominating half the shores of the [[Great Lakes]] from the tip of present-day Northern [[Maine]] and [[New England]] nearly to Western Ohio, and extended southerly from the northern shores beyond [[Lake Huron]]'s [[Georgian Bay]] (Huron) down along the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and parts of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Concurrently as the 1600s brought European [[fur trade]]rs and then colonies, two large Iroquoian nations, the [[Tuscarora people]] and the [[Cherokee people]] occupied lands south of the [[Province of Virginia]] on either side of the [[Appalachians]] [[barrier range]]; west of the lower Appalachians, the [[Cherokee]] held territory in Kentucky and Tennessee. \n}} of the origination and the migration of the Iroquois and Iroquoian peoples that came to inhabit the region around Buffalo and the Niagara River.{{ \n \nefn\n |[[New France|French]] [[colonialism]] and the process of settlements used the [[Kingdom of England|English]] were very different modalities; the French Crown monopolized American economic activity: traders, and a relatively few number of settlers danced to the Crown's policies, and  cultivated good relations with Amerindian tribe and nations. In the French, Dutch, and English disputes that followed, the undermanned French were dependent upon their Amerindian allies for manpower, and most military power.\nIn contrast, the English [[mercantilism]] driven [[colonialism]]&mdash;later in the 1700s, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]&mdash;almost universally established an initial tolerance seguing soon after settlements became well established to an mode of oft ruthless exploitation and patterns of confrontation, racial prejudice, and land grabs; the English/British class-conscience culture almost uniformly ended up in frontier tension and eventual interracial conflict leading to a succession of wars, of displaced [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native American]] tribes. The English modality had little direct frontier impact effect around Buffalo but the Indian vs. Indian events in the region are illustrative of both Kingdoms practices and the Iroquois grudge against the French.\n }}\n \nThe [[Kingdom of France|French]] found the Neutral groups helpful in mediating disputes with other tribes&mdash;in particular the [[League of the Iroquois]] which became sworn enemies of the French from their first meeting in 1609.{{efn\n  | In 1609 Champlain assisting a mixed war party of Huron and Algonquian raiding the Mohawk Nation, along the lake now named for him, killed two of three Mohawk war sachems, wounding the third and built up an enmity from the Iroquois that lasted 150 years, until the end of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756-1763) drove the French from North America. This encounter is an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], beginning a period now loosely referred to as the [[Beaver Wars]] in which over 60 years of internecine Amerindian on Indian battles, giving the Iroquois the balance of North American political power for the next hundred. The Beaver Wars for many years were believed to be mainly economic. Recent scholarship has posed several other factors, most steeped in the culture and religious beliefs of the disparate Iroquoian peoples.\n  }} By comparison, the Huron also an Iroquoian people, were often at odds with the Iroquois once European traders offered highly desired goods for furs, especially water proof [[Beaver]] pelts{{efn\n  |the Huron territory started in the upper St. Lawrence valley, and the Iroquois claimed virtually all of the opposite bank; so were in competition in the European Goods sweepstakes.\n  }} About 1651 the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] declared war on the Neutrals; by 1653, the Confederacy, particularly the [[Seneca people|Senecas]], had practically annihilated the Neutrals<ref name=\"newadvent\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07565a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', \"The Hurons\"]</ref><ref>Reville 1920, p.20.</ref> and the splinter tribe of [[Wenro people]].

In 1667-68 the Susquehannocks nearly wiped out two of the Five Iroquois people.

Its buildings were destroyed a year later by the evacuating French after the British captured Fort Niagara. The British took control of the entire region in 1763, at the conclusion of the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1764, British military engineer [[John Montresor]] made an inspection tour of [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] before determining on a site for a fortification on the opposite shore. After the 1779 Sullivan Expedition, the British settled Seneca refugees in several villages on [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] in the spring of 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cdv-buffalo-mainstreet1.jpg|thumbnail|left|c1870 Carte-de-Visite of Main Street, Buffalo, New York]] -->\nThe first permanent settlers in present-day Buffalo were Cornelius Winney and \"Black Joe\" Hodges, who set up a log cabin store there in 1789 for trading with the Native American community. British interpreter William Johnston was another early settler. The British retained control of the area and prevented further settlement by Americans until their evacuation of Fort Niagara in 1796.\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]] investors purchased the area from the Seneca Indians as part of the [[Holland Purchase]]. Although other Senecas were involved in ceding their land, the most famous today is [[Red Jacket]], who died in Buffalo in 1830.  His grave is in [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo|Forest Lawn Cemetery]].  Starting in 1801, parcels were sold through the [[Holland Land Company|Holland Land Companies]] office in [[Batavia, New York]].

Buffalo gradually rebuilt itself and by 1816 had a new courthouse. In 1818, the eastern part of the town was lost to form the [[Amherst, New York|Town of Amherst]].\n\nUpon the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, Buffalo became the western end of the 524-mile waterway starting at [[New York City]].  At the time, Buffalo had a population of about 2,400 people.  With the increased commerce of the canal, the population boomed and Buffalo was incorporated as a [[city]] in 1832.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.buffalonet.org/charter.html|title=Original Charter of the City of Buffalo 1832|website=history.buffalonet.org|access-date=2017-05-12}}</ref> On 1 June 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was put into service by a local merchant, Joseph Dart, Jr., and an engineer, Robert Dunbar.

During the 19th century, thousands of pioneers going to the western United States debarked from canal boats to continue their journey out of Buffalo by lake or [[rail transport]]. During their stopover, many experienced the pleasures and dangers of Buffalo's notorious [[Canal Street (Buffalo)|Canal district]].\n\nBuffalo was a terminus of the [[Underground Railroad]], an informal series of safe houses for [[African-Americans]] escaping slavery in the mid-19th century.

[[Hydroelectric power]] harnessed from nearby [[Niagara Falls]] made Buffalo the first American city to have widespread [[Incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]] yielding it the nickname, the \"''City of Light''\". Electricity was used to dramatic effect at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901. The Pan-American was also notable for being the scene of the aforementioned assassination of [[William McKinley|President William McKinley]].\n\nThe opening of the [[Peace Bridge]] linking Buffalo with [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] on August 7, 1927 was an occasion for significant celebrations.\n\nThe Great Depression of 1929-39 saw severe unemployment, especially among working-class men.

Neither the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name ''Teyohoseroron'' (the Place of the Basswoods) nor the French name ''Riviere aux Chevaux'' (River of Horses) survived, so the current name likely dates to the British occupation which began with the capture of [[Fort Niagara]] in 1759.\n\nAnother theory holds that a [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] Indian lived there, either whose name meant buffalo, or who had the physical characteristics of a buffalo, and was translated as such by the English settlers. The stream where he lived became Buffalo's Creek. Unlike other nearby creeks such as Scajaquada Creek and Smoke's Creek which were named after actual historic figures, there is no known reference to any Native American named Buffalo. Also given credence by local historians at one time was the possibility that an interpreter mistranslated the Native American word for \"[[beaver]]\" as \"buffalo,\" the words being very similar, at a treaty-signing at present-day [[Rome, New York]] in 1784. The theory assumes that because there were beaver here, the creek was probably called Beaver Creek rather than Buffalo Creek.[[Image:Buffalo Panorama 1911.jpg|thumb|400px|Buffalo panorama circa 1911]]Another theory holds that the name is an [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] form of the [[France|French]] name ''Beau Fleuve'' (beautiful river), which was supposedly an exclamation uttered by [[Louis Hennepin]] when he first saw the Niagara River. This is a relatively recently proposed theory (1909) and is unlikely, as no period sources contain this quote. The earliest known name origin theory is an anecdote told to Captain Daniel Dobbins by Cornelius Winney in 1795 and also found with variations in Sheldon Ball's History of Buffalo (1825) and other sources, about a party of hunters whose guide shoots a horse and passes it off as bison meat, thereafter the origin of the term \"buffaloed.\"\n\nDespite many years of speculation and garbling of previous debate, more recently available sources indicate that the name Buffalo Creek was in common use on the Niagara Frontier by 1764, as [[John Montresor]] referenced 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of that year.<ref name=Montresor_BuffaloCreek>{{cite book |title=Buffalo Historical Society Publications |chapter=The Achievements of Captain John Montresor |author=Severance, Frank H. |editor=Buffalo Historical Society |location=Buffalo, NY |date=1902 |publisher=Bigelow Brothers |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBs8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA15 |page=15 |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> The name may have originated with an English speaking person sometime between 1759 and 1764, possibly after seeing animal bones, thought to be bison but possibly elk or moose or domesticated cattle, at the salt lick called Sour Springs located at the head of navigation about 6 miles up the creek.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n===Amerindian Crossroads===\nThe societies of the Native Forest dwellers we know as Native Americans, Amerindians, or First Nations made highways of the Great Lakes, streams and were far more social than their reputed penchant for warfare, cruelty, and collecting scalps would suggest. Their canoes were built from lightweight birch bark, or far more often, Elm, the farther south the tribe, the more likely Elm was the material used for many purposes including the canoes. Buffalo, near the throat of the Niagara River, was a popular campsite for voyaging tribesmen, in a culture which often went on walk-abouts, touring neighboring lands and conducting the widespread practice of boy-meets-girl, trading of regional commodities.{{efn\n  | Obsidian from Canada, Flint, shells, plants are all known to have traveled hundreds-to-thousands of miles carried by a sociable people that often met recreationally as well for competitions&mdash;for [[Lacrosse]]&mdash;the picture of the Amerindian tribes as blood thirsty savages would never have lasted in the light of day, had the natives not been cut down by diseases they had little resistance to.\n  }} \n[[Image:Wenro-Territorium um 1630.png|thumb|left|320px<!--\n\n--->|alt=:Wenro-Territorium um 1630.png|1630s: The French report the '''Wenro''''s territory was north and east of the [[Erie people]]s, East of the [[Neutral people]] across the [[Niagara River]] and west of the [[Genesee River]] valley and the ''Genesee Gorge'' across which the Seneca people had their home.]]\nPrior to European colonization by French settlers, the region's inhabitants were an [[Iroquoian language|Iroquoian-speaking]] tribal offshoot called the [[Wenro people]] or'' 'Wenrohronon','' who lived along the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its southern shore. The population of the Wenro was small by comparison to other Iroquoian tribes the French encountered and reported upon, possibly because they'd only recently split off from other groups or because they'd suffered the misfortunes of war. They were possibly (most likely) a sub-group of the main [[Neutral Nation|''Neutral Confederacy'']] which had colonized the opposite shore, or possibly relatives of the great abutting neighboring [[Erie Nation]],{{efn \n  | It is also possible they were a combination of clan groups from differing peoples. The Iroquoian culture was one with a matrilineal clan basis, the women selecting the leading men.

Either way, by 300 years later the various Iroquoian peoples dominated the area of the right bank St. Lawrence River to the Eastern side of [[Lake Huron]] dominating half the shores of the [[Great Lakes]] from the tip of present-day Northern [[Maine]] and [[New England]] nearly to Western Ohio, and extended southerly from the northern shores beyond [[Lake Huron]]'s [[Georgian Bay]] (Huron) down along the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and parts of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Concurrently as the 1600s brought European [[fur trade]]rs and then colonies, two large Iroquoian nations, the [[Tuscarora people]] and the [[Cherokee people]] occupied lands south of the [[Province of Virginia]] on either side of the [[Appalachians]] [[barrier range]]; west of the lower Appalachians, the [[Cherokee]] held territory in Kentucky and Tennessee. \n}} of the origination and the migration of the Iroquois and Iroquoian peoples that came to inhabit the region around Buffalo and the Niagara River.{{ \n \nefn\n |[[New France|French]] [[colonialism]] and the process of settlements used the [[Kingdom of England|English]] were very different modalities; the French Crown monopolized American economic activity: traders, and a relatively few number of settlers danced to the Crown's policies, and  cultivated good relations with Amerindian tribe and nations. In the French, Dutch, and English disputes that followed, the undermanned French were dependent upon their Amerindian allies for manpower, and most military power.\nIn contrast, the English [[mercantilism]] driven [[colonialism]]&mdash;later in the 1700s, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]&mdash;almost universally established an initial tolerance seguing soon after settlements became well established to an mode of oft ruthless exploitation and patterns of confrontation, racial prejudice, and land grabs; the English/British class-conscience culture almost uniformly ended up in frontier tension and eventual interracial conflict leading to a succession of wars, of displaced [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native American]] tribes. The English modality had little direct frontier impact effect around Buffalo but the Indian vs. Indian events in the region are illustrative of both Kingdoms practices and the Iroquois grudge against the French.\n }}\n \nThe [[Kingdom of France|French]] found the Neutral groups helpful in mediating disputes with other tribes&mdash;in particular the [[League of the Iroquois]] which became sworn enemies of the French from their first meeting in 1609.{{efn\n  | In 1609 Champlain assisting a mixed war party of Huron and Algonquian raiding the Mohawk Nation, along the lake now named for him, killed two of three Mohawk war sachems, wounding the third and built up an enmity from the Iroquois that lasted 150 years, until the end of the [[French and Indian War]] (1756-1763) drove the French from North America. This encounter is an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], beginning a period now loosely referred to as the [[Beaver Wars]] in which over 60 years of internecine Amerindian on Indian battles, giving the Iroquois the balance of North American political power for the next hundred. The Beaver Wars for many years were believed to be mainly economic. Recent scholarship has posed several other factors, most steeped in the culture and religious beliefs of the disparate Iroquoian peoples.\n  }} By comparison, the Huron also an Iroquoian people, were often at odds with the Iroquois once European traders offered highly desired goods for furs, especially water proof [[Beaver]] pelts{{efn\n  |the Huron territory started in the upper St. Lawrence valley, and the Iroquois claimed virtually all of the opposite bank; so were in competition in the European Goods sweepstakes.\n  }} About 1651 the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] declared war on the Neutrals; by 1653, the Confederacy, particularly the [[Seneca people|Senecas]], had practically annihilated the Neutrals<ref name=\"newadvent\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07565a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', \"The Hurons\"]</ref><ref>Reville 1920, p.20.</ref> and the splinter tribe of [[Wenro people]].  The Wenro's area was subsequently populated by the Seneca tribe.\n \nAlso in 1653 the large and populous Erie tribe, having taken in survivors of the Huron, Neutral, Wenro, and [[Tabacco people]]s&mdash;Iroquoian peoples one and all, with traditions of adopting outsiders&mdash;received demands to send Neutrals to the Iroquois and instead launched an preemptive attack on the League, kicking off three years of desperate warfare that eventually shattered the Erie and bled the Iroquois of much of their strength.{{efn\n |One of the Iroquois few periods of peace occurred, giving evidence of the savvy political sophistication the Iroquois would now become famous for having; a similar peace was negotiated when the Susquehannock and Iroquois fought&mdash;the council ruling the Iroquois did not want Algonkian raiding while taking on militarily strong opponents.\n }} Ohio and Western Pennsylvania became nearly vacant Iroquois hunting grounds, exploited for furs, but ten years later the Iroquois, having also adopted tribal members of peoples they'd recently thrashed, found themselves in a new war with the [[Susquehannock]]s who lived down below the [[Allegheny Front]], the [[escarpment]] above most of today's [[central Pennsylvania]] along the [[Susquehanna River]] valleys&mdash;another people believed to have significantly outnumbered the Iroquois{{efn\n |The American Heritage Book of Indians discuss a French report (New France was a direct venture of the King, the Jesuits sent back reports every year for decades) ca. 1660s-1670s that ''the adopted Iroquois'' outnumbered the Native Iroquois in that period.\n  }} &mdash;so warring along the Susquehanna Valley from lower New York to Maryland through central Pennsylvania. In 1667-68 the Susquehannocks nearly wiped out two of the Five Iroquois people. At that point the Susquehannock's suffered one or more horrendous plagues, losing up to 90% of their population and military capabilities, and by 1672 the Iroquois became the proverbial'' 'Last Man Standing' ''in the Northern Beaver Wars.\n\n===First Europeans===\nMost of [[western New York]] was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Duke of York]] (later King [[James II of England|James II & VII]]), but the first European settlement in what is now [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] was by the French, at the mouth of [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] in 1758. Its buildings were destroyed a year later by the evacuating French after the British captured Fort Niagara. The British took control of the entire region in 1763, at the conclusion of the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1764, British military engineer [[John Montresor]] made an inspection tour of [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] before determining on a site for a fortification on the opposite shore. After the 1779 Sullivan Expedition, the British settled Seneca refugees in several villages on [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] in the spring of 1780.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cdv-buffalo-mainstreet1.jpg|thumbnail|left|c1870 Carte-de-Visite of Main Street, Buffalo, New York]] -->\nThe first permanent settlers in present-day Buffalo were Cornelius Winney and \"Black Joe\" Hodges, who set up a log cabin store there in 1789 for trading with the Native American community. British interpreter William Johnston was another early settler. The British retained control of the area and prevented further settlement by Americans until their evacuation of Fort Niagara in 1796.\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]] investors purchased the area from the Seneca Indians as part of the [[Holland Purchase]]. Although other Senecas were involved in ceding their land, the most famous today is [[Red Jacket]], who died in Buffalo in 1830.  His grave is in [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo|Forest Lawn Cemetery]].  Starting in 1801, parcels were sold through the [[Holland Land Company|Holland Land Companies]] office in [[Batavia, New York]].

In 1810, the Town of Buffalo was formed from the western part of the [[Clarence, New York|Town of Clarence]]. On December 30, 1813, during the [[War of 1812]], British troops and their Native American allies first captured the village of [[Black Rock, Buffalo, New York|Black Rock]], and then the rest of Buffalo, burning most of both to the ground. Buffalo gradually rebuilt itself and by 1816 had a new courthouse. In 1818, the eastern part of the town was lost to form the [[Amherst, New York|Town of Amherst]].\n\nUpon the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, Buffalo became the western end of the 524-mile waterway starting at [[New York City]].  At the time, Buffalo had a population of about 2,400 people.  With the increased commerce of the canal, the population boomed and Buffalo was incorporated as a [[city]] in 1832.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.buffalonet.org/charter.html|title=Original Charter of the City of Buffalo 1832|website=history.buffalonet.org|access-date=2017-05-12}}</ref> On 1 June 1843, the world's first steam-powered [[grain elevator]] was put into service by a local merchant, Joseph Dart, Jr., and an engineer, Robert Dunbar.

During the 19th century, thousands of pioneers going to the western United States debarked from canal boats to continue their journey out of Buffalo by lake or [[rail transport]]. During their stopover, many experienced the pleasures and dangers of Buffalo's notorious [[Canal Street (Buffalo)|Canal district]].\n\nBuffalo was a terminus of the [[Underground Railroad]], an informal series of safe houses for [[African-Americans]] escaping slavery in the mid-19th century.

Immigrants came from [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Poland]] to work in the [[Steel mill|steel]] and [[grain mill]]s which had taken advantage of the city's critical location at the junction of the [[Great Lakes]] and the Erie Canal. [[Hydroelectric power]] harnessed from nearby [[Niagara Falls]] made Buffalo the first American city to have widespread [[Incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]] yielding it the nickname, the \"''City of Light''\". Electricity was used to dramatic effect at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901. The Pan-American was also notable for being the scene of the aforementioned assassination of [[William McKinley|President William McKinley]].\n\nThe opening of the [[Peace Bridge]] linking Buffalo with [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] on August 7, 1927 was an occasion for significant celebrations.\n\nThe Great Depression of 1929-39 saw severe unemployment, especially among working class men. The [[New Deal]] relief programs operated full force. The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party.<ref>Lewis Lansky, \"Buffalo and the Great Depression, 1929-1933,\" in Milton Plesur, ed., ''American Historian: Essays to Honor Selig Adler'' (1980), pp 204-13</ref> \nBuffalo's [[Buffalo City Hall|City Hall]], an [[Art Deco]] masterpiece, was dedicated on July 1, 1932.\n\nThe city's importance declined in the later half of the 20th century for several reasons, perhaps the most devastating being the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1957. Goods which had previously passed through Buffalo could now bypass it using a series of canals and locks, reaching the ocean via the [[St. Lawrence River]]. Another major toll was [[Suburbanization|suburban migration]], a national trend at the time.

It was commissioned by [[Santa Fe Opera]], [[Seattle Opera]], [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Jacobs School of Music]] at Indiana University, with support from Cal Performances. The opera is about one of the most influential people in recent history; it is set at a time when he must confront his own mortality and circle back on the events that shaped his personal and professional life. \n\n==Performance history==\nThe world premiere took place at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, conducted by [[Michael Christie (conductor)|Michael Christie]]. The original production featured direction by Kevin Newbury, scenic design by Vita Tzykun, costume design by Paul Carey, lighting design by Japhy Weideman, projection design by Ben Pearcy for 59 Productions, and sound design by Rick Jacobsohn and Brian Loach; it was a co-production of Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera, and the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. ''The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs'' was the most popular new opera in Santa Fe Opera's history and one of the top-selling operas in the company's history. An extra performance had to be added to accommodate the demand for tickets. In May 2018, a recording of the work was issued under the [[Pentatone (record label)|Pentatone]] label; Bates and Campbell received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for Best Contemporary Classical Composition, engineers Mark Donahue and Dirk Sobotka were nominated for Best Engineered Album (Classical), and Elizabeth Ostrow was nominated for Producer of the Year (Classical). The recording won the 2019 Grammy for Best Opera Recording (honoring conductor Michael Christie, producer Elizabeth Ostrow, and principal soloists Sasha Cooke, Jessica E. Jones, Edward Parks, Garrett Sorenson, and Wei Wu).\n\nBates was drawn to [[Steve Jobs]] as the subject for an opera, because, he says, opera \u201ccan illuminate the interior thoughts of different characters simultaneously through the juxtaposition of individual themes. That makes it an ideal medium to explore a man who revolutionized how we communicate.\u201d<ref>Bates, Mason, \"The Music of Communication\" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 76\u201378</ref> Bates asked Mark Campbell, one of America's leading opera librettists, to create the story in the libretto. According to Campbell, \u201cLearning that Jobs was a Buddhist his entire adult life lead me to the ens\u014d, the circle that is drawn in Japanese calligraphy to express enlightenment. I connected that with Jobs\u2019 habit of taking long walks and the Zen practice of pacing in a circular pattern called a kinhin and began to develop a story in which Steve \u2018circles back\u2019 on his life. The title actually refers less to the revolution Jobs helped create in technology rather than the kinhin of self-reflection that propels the story.\u201d <ref>Campbell, Mark, \"The Evolution of ''(R)evolution''\" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Gary Rydstrom of Skywalker Sound assisted Bates with the production of the opera\u2019s electronic sounds.\n\nThere have been two other presentations of the original Santa Fe production, with a third planned in 2020.\n\n* Indiana University's [[Jacobs School of Music]] presented four performances of the opera in 2018 in their Musical Arts Center.

It was commissioned by [[Santa Fe Opera]], [[Seattle Opera]], [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Jacobs School of Music]] at Indiana University, with support from Cal Performances. The opera is about one of the most influential people in recent history; it is set at a time when he must confront his own mortality and circle back on the events that shaped his personal and professional life. Rob Klock is the biggest fan of this opera.\n\n==Performance history==\nThe world premiere took place at the Santa Fe Opera in 2017, conducted by [[Michael Christie (conductor)|Michael Christie]]. The original production featured direction by Kevin Newbury, scenic design by Vita Tzykun, costume design by Paul Carey, lighting design by Japhy Weideman, projection design by Ben Pearcy for 59 Productions, and sound design by Rick Jacobsohn and Brian Loach; it was a co-production of Santa Fe Opera, Seattle Opera, San Francisco Opera, and the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. ''The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs'' was the most popular new opera in Santa Fe Opera's history and one of the top-selling operas in the company's history. An extra performance had to be added to accommodate the demand for tickets. In May 2018, a recording of the work was issued under the [[Pentatone (record label)|Pentatone]] label; Bates and Campbell received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for Best Contemporary Classical Composition, engineers Mark Donahue and Dirk Sobotka were nominated for Best Engineered Album (Classical), and Elizabeth Ostrow was nominated for Producer of the Year (Classical). The recording won the 2019 Grammy for Best Opera Recording (honoring conductor Michael Christie, producer Elizabeth Ostrow, and principal soloists Sasha Cooke, Jessica E. Jones, Edward Parks, Garrett Sorenson, and Wei Wu).\n\nBates was drawn to [[Steve Jobs]] as the subject for an opera, because, he says, opera \u201ccan illuminate the interior thoughts of different characters simultaneously through the juxtaposition of individual themes. That makes it an ideal medium to explore a man who revolutionized how we communicate.\u201d<ref>Bates, Mason, \"The Music of Communication\" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 76\u201378</ref> Bates asked Mark Campbell, one of America's leading opera librettists, to create the story in the libretto. According to Campbell, \u201cLearning that Jobs was a Buddhist his entire adult life lead me to the ens\u014d, the circle that is drawn in Japanese calligraphy to express enlightenment. I connected that with Jobs\u2019 habit of taking long walks and the Zen practice of pacing in a circular pattern called a kinhin and began to develop a story in which Steve \u2018circles back\u2019 on his life. The title actually refers less to the revolution Jobs helped create in technology rather than the kinhin of self-reflection that propels the story.\u201d <ref>Campbell, Mark, \"The Evolution of ''(R)evolution''\" in Santa Fe Opera 2017 program book, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Gary Rydstrom of Skywalker Sound assisted Bates with the production of the opera\u2019s electronic sounds.\n\nThere have been two other presentations of the original Santa Fe production, with a third planned in 2020.\n\n* Indiana University's [[Jacobs School of Music]] presented four performances of the opera in 2018 in their Musical Arts Center.
