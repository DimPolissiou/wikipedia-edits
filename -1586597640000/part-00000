It occurs in grassland and forest at {{convert|400|to|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. After the [[species]] was first named in 1897, several other names were given to various populations now included in ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''. They are now all recognized as part of a single, widespread and variable species. ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is related to ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'' and other members of the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' [[species group]]. It reproduces year-round. Because it is widely distributed and common, ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is listed as \"[[least concern]]\" on the [[IUCN Red List]].\n\n''Akodon spegazzinii'' is medium in size for the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' species group. The coloration of its upperparts varies considerably, from light to dark and from yellowish to reddish brown. The underparts are yellow-brown to gray. The eyes are surrounded by a ring of yellow fur. The [[skull]] contains an hourglass-shaped [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes) and various features of the skull distinguish the species from its close allies. Head and body length is {{convert|93|to|196|mm|in|abbr=on}} and body mass is {{convert|13.0|to|38.0|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Its [[karyotype]] has [[Diploid|2n]] = 40 and [[Fundamental number|FN]] = 40.<ref name=MC1099 />\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Akodon spegazzinii'' was first described in 1897 from [[Salta Province]] by [[Oldfield Thomas]] on the basis of a collection made in late 1896 or early 1897<!--Dec. 1896\u2013Feb. 1897; Thomas, 1897, p.&nbsp;214--> by mycologist [[Carlos Luigi Spegazzini]], after whom the species was named.<ref>Thomas, 1897, pp.&nbsp;214, 216; Beolen et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;387<!--explicit confirmation that it is named after Spegazzini-->; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1099<!--type locality is in Salta--></ref> Four years later, [[Joel Asaph Allen]] named ''Akodon tucumanensis'' from [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]], comparing it to various species now [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] under ''[[Abrothrix olivaceus]]''.<ref>Allen, 1901, pp.&nbsp;410\u2013411; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1090<!--Akodon canescens and Akodon xanthorhinus are synonyms of Abrothrix olivaceus--></ref> Thomas named an additional species, ''Akodon alterus'', from [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] in 1919, and considered it closely related to ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref>Thomas, 1919, pp.&nbsp;496\u2013497</ref> A fourth species, ''Akodon leucolimnaeus'', was described by [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera (naturalist)|\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] from [[Catamarca Province]] in 1926, but after 1932 it was associated with ''Akodon lactens'' (now ''[[Necromys lactens]]'') as a [[subspecies]].<ref name=MC1095>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1095</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Cabrera listed both ''spegazzinii'' and ''tucumanensis'' as subspecies of ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'', with ''alterus'' as a full synonym of ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis tucumanensis''.<ref name=\"MC1099\"/> In 1990, Philip Myers and colleagues reviewed the ''Akodon boliviensis'' species group. They provisionally kept ''Akodon spegazzinii'' as a species separate from ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'', with ''tucumanensis'' as a subspecies, and suggested that ''alterus'' was likely related to ''spegazzinii'' and ''tucumanensis''.<ref>Myers et al., 1990, p.&nbsp;62</ref> Subsequently, the treatment of these species in [[systematics|systematic]] works became variable. A 1992 paper suggested that ''alterus'' and ''tucumanensis'' were, at best, very similar to each other,<ref name=Jea32/> but in 1997, Michael Mares and colleagues listed each of the three as distinct species in a compendium of the mammals of Catamarca, citing differences in habitat and fur coloration.<ref>Mares et al., 1997, pp.&nbsp;113, 115\u2013116</ref> They were followed by M\u00f3nica D\u00edaz and Rub\u00e9n B\u00e1rquez in 2007, among others.<ref>D\u00edaz and Barquez, 2007, pp.&nbsp;485, 489; Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32</ref> In 2000 D\u00edaz and colleagues listed ''alterus'' and ''tucumanensis'' as subspecies of ''spegazzinii'' in a review of the mammals of Salta.<ref>D\u00edaz et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;24</ref> [[Guy Musser]] and Michael Carleton, in the 2005 third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'', also considered the three to represent the same species,<ref name=MC1099/> as did Ulyses Pardi\u00f1as and colleagues in a 2006 review of Argentinean [[Akodontini]].<ref>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;155</ref> Meanwhile, Carlos Galliari and Pardi\u00f1as had recognized ''Akodon leucolimnaeus'' as a true ''Akodon'', not a ''Necromys'', in 1995. Although associated with the ''Akodon boliviensis'' group, its precise status remained unclear.<ref>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1095</ref> The [[common name]] \"Catamarca akodont\" was proposed for this species.<ref name=MC1095/>\n\nIn 1980, Julio Contreras and Mar\u00eda Rosi<ref name=Pea47>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, p.&nbsp;47</ref> identified an ''Akodon'' from the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] as ''Akodon varius neocenus'' (now ''[[Akodon neocenus]]''), but the following year, they identified it as a new species, named ''Akodon minoprioi'' in a presentation at a scientific meeting. This name was never formally validated.<ref name=Bea216>Braun et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;216</ref> In 2000, Janet Braun and colleagues formally named this species ''Akodon oenos'' and allied it to the ''[[Akodon varius]]'' species group. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''oenos'', is Greek for \"wine\" and refers to the animal's occurrence in the wine-producing region of Mendoza.<ref name=Bea218>Braun et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;218</ref> The common names \"Monte akodont\"<ref name=MC1097>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1097</ref> and \"wine grass mouse\"<ref>Duff and Lawson, 2004</ref> were proposed for this species.\n\nIn 2010, Pablo Jayat and colleagues reviewed the members of the ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'' species group, including ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] or molecular characters between animals belonging to ''A.&nbsp;alterus'', ''A.&nbsp;leucolimnaeus'', ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', and ''A.&nbsp;tucumanensis'', and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species.<ref name=Jea32/> Although genetic variation is relatively high within ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', there is no clear geographic structure among [[haplotype]]s from different regions.<ref name=Jea29/> The next year, Ulyses Pardi\u00f1as and colleagues concluded that ''A.&nbsp;oenos'', which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the ''A.&nbsp;varius'' species group, was in fact another [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref name=\"Pea47\"/> The proliferation of scientific names for this one species occurred because of the terseness of the original description of ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'',<ref name=Jea28>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;28</ref> and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref name=Jea32>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32</ref>\n\n{{cladogram|align=right|caption=Relationships within the ''Akodon boliviensis'' species group according to analysis of data from the cytochrome ''b'' gene<ref name=phylogenetics>Jayat et al., 2010, fig.&nbsp;1; D'El\u00eda et al., 2011, fig.&nbsp;6; Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, fig.&nbsp;1</ref>|clades=\n{{clade|style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%\n|label1=''Akodon boliviensis'' group\n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1=''[[Akodon sylvanus]]''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Akodon polopi]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Akodon boliviensis]]''\n            |2='''''Akodon spegazzinii'''''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Akodon caenosus]]''\n      |2=''[[Akodon lutescens]]''\n      |3=''[[Akodon subfuscus]]''\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nAccording to [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]] from the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] gene, ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is most closely related to ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' and more distantly to other members of the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' species group, including ''[[Akodon polopi]]'' and ''[[Akodon sylvanus]]''.<ref name=phylogenetics/> The ''boliviensis'' group is part of the highly diverse genus ''[[Akodon]]'' and thereby of the tribe [[Akodontini]], which includes about 90 species of South American rodents. Akodontini is one of several tribes within the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] and the family [[Cricetidae]], which includes hundreds of mainly small rodents distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe species is intermediate in size for the ''Akodon boliviensis'' species group; it is smaller than ''A.&nbsp;polopi'' and ''A.&nbsp;sylvanus'', but larger than ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' and ''A.&nbsp;caenosus''.<ref name=Jeat1>Jayat et al., 2010, table 1</ref> The more distantly related ''[[Akodon budini|A.&nbsp;budini]]'' and ''[[Akodon simulator|A.&nbsp;simulator]]'', which occur in the same area, are larger.<ref>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;30; Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp.&nbsp;1094, 1099</ref> ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is variable in coloration, ranging from light to dark and from reddish to yellowish brown.<ref name=Jea28/> In general, animals in wetter, lower-lying areas are darker, and those in open, dry environments are paler. There is also variation within populations, and sometimes young mice are darker and [[lactation|lactating]] females are more reddish.<ref name=Jea29/> The formerly recognized species ''Akodon tucumanensis'' corresponds to the dark, low-altitude populations, while ''A.&nbsp;leucolimnaeus'' and ''A.&nbsp;alterus'' represent more reddish, high-altitude animals.<ref name=Pea56>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, p.&nbsp;56</ref>\n\nThe coloration of the upperparts is generally uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow ring around the eyes,<ref name=Jea28/> which is more prominent than in ''A.&nbsp;sylvanus''.<ref name=Jea30>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;30</ref> The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin.<ref name=Jea28/> Although this white spot is better developed than in ''A.&nbsp;sylvanus'', ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'' lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in ''A.&nbsp;simulator''.<ref name=Jea30/> The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. [[Ungual tuft]]s of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below.<ref name=Jea28/> High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.<ref name=Jea29/>\n\nIn the skull, the front part (rostrum) is large,<ref name=Jea29/> but not as long as in ''A.&nbsp;budini''.<ref name=Jea30/> The skull is more robust than in the very similar ''Akodon boliviensis'',<ref name=Jea21>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;21</ref> but less so than in ''A.&nbsp;simulator''.<ref name=Jea30/> The hourglass-shaped [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes)<ref name=Jea29/> is narrower than in ''A.&nbsp;caenosus''<ref name=Jea24>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;24</ref> and not as squared as in ''A.&nbsp;polopi''.<ref name=Jea42>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;42</ref> Members of the ''Akodon varius'' group, with which ''Akodon oenos'' was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions.<ref name=Pea55>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, p.&nbsp;55</ref> The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed [[temporal crest|temporal]] and [[lambdoid crest]]s<ref name=Jea28/> relative to the situation in ''A.&nbsp;caenosus'';<ref name=Jea24/> ''Akodon polopi'' has even better developed crests.<ref name=Jea42/>\n\nAlthough the [[zygomatic plate]]s (plates of bone at the side of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the ''Akodon boliviensis'' group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave.<ref name=Jea29/> The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in ''A.&nbsp;caenosus'' and ''A.&nbsp;sylvanus''.<ref>Jayat et al., 2010, pp.&nbsp;24, 29</ref> The [[incisive foramina]] (openings in the front part of the [[palate]]) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper [[molar (tooth)|molars]].<ref name=Jea28/> Tiny [[posterolateral palatal pits]] are located at the back of the palate.<ref name=Jea29>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;29</ref> The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle ([[medial process]]) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], is of intermediate width,<ref name=Jea28/> being narrower than in ''A.&nbsp;sylvanus'', ''A.&nbsp;simulator'', and ''A.&nbsp;budini'' but broader than in ''A.&nbsp;caenosus''.<ref>Jayat et al., 2010, pp.&nbsp;24, 29, 30</ref>\n\nThe [[masseteric crest]]s (crests on the outer sides of the [[mandible]]s) reach their front ends below the front border of the first molars.

It occurs in grassland and forest at {{convert|400|to|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. After the [[species]] was first named in 1897, several other names were given to various populations now included in ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''. They are now all recognized as part of a single, widespread and variable species. ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is related to ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'' and other members of the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' [[species group]]. It reproduces year-round. Because it is widely distributed and common, ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is listed as \"[[least concern]]\" on the [[IUCN Red List]].\n\n''Akodon spegazzinii'' is medium in size for the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' species group. The coloration of its upperparts varies considerably, from light to dark and from yellowish to reddish brown. The underparts are yellow-brown to gray. The eyes are surrounded by a ring of yellow fur. The [[skull]] contains an hourglass-shaped [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes) and various features of the skull distinguish the species from its close allies. Head and body length is {{convert|93|to|196|mm|in|abbr=on}} and body mass is {{convert|13.0|to|38.0|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Its [[karyotype]] has [[Diploid|2n]] = 40 and [[Fundamental number|FN]] = 40.<ref name=MC1099 />\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Akodon spegazzinii'' was first described in 1897 from [[Salta Province]] by [[Oldfield Thomas]] on the basis of a collection made in late 1896 or early 1897<!--Dec. 1896\u2013Feb. 1897; Thomas, 1897, p.&nbsp;214--> by mycologist [[Carlos Luigi Spegazzini]], after whom the species was named.<ref>Thomas, 1897, pp.&nbsp;214, 216; Beolen et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;387<!--explicit confirmation that it is named after Spegazzini-->; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1099<!--type locality is in Salta--></ref> Four years later, [[Joel Asaph Allen]] named ''Akodon tucumanensis'' from [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]], comparing it to various species now [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] under ''[[Abrothrix olivaceus]]''.<ref>Allen, 1901, pp.&nbsp;410\u2013411; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1090<!--Akodon canescens and Akodon xanthorhinus are synonyms of Abrothrix olivaceus--></ref> Thomas named an additional species, ''Akodon alterus'', from [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] in 1919, and considered it closely related to ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref>Thomas, 1919, pp.&nbsp;496\u2013497</ref> A fourth species, ''Akodon leucolimnaeus'', was described by [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera (naturalist)|\u00c1ngel Cabrera]] from [[Catamarca Province]] in 1926, but after 1932 it was associated with ''Akodon lactens'' (now ''[[Necromys lactens]]'') as a [[subspecies]].<ref name=MC1095>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1095</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Cabrera listed both ''spegazzinii'' and ''tucumanensis'' as subspecies of ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'', with ''alterus'' as a full synonym of ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis tucumanensis''.<ref name=\"MC1099\"/> In 1990, Philip Myers and colleagues reviewed the ''Akodon boliviensis'' species group. They provisionally kept ''Akodon spegazzinii'' as a species separate from ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'', with ''tucumanensis'' as a subspecies, and suggested that ''alterus'' was likely related to ''spegazzinii'' and ''tucumanensis''.<ref>Myers et al., 1990, p.&nbsp;62</ref> Subsequently, the treatment of these species in [[systematics|systematic]] works became variable. A 1992 paper suggested that ''alterus'' and ''tucumanensis'' were, at best, very similar to each other,<ref name=Jea32/> but in 1997, Michael Mares and colleagues listed each of the three as distinct species in a compendium of the mammals of Catamarca, citing differences in habitat and fur coloration.<ref>Mares et al., 1997, pp.&nbsp;113, 115\u2013116</ref> They were followed by M\u00f3nica D\u00edaz and Rub\u00e9n B\u00e1rquez in 2007, among others.<ref>D\u00edaz and Barquez, 2007, pp.&nbsp;485, 489; Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32</ref> In 2000 D\u00edaz and colleagues listed ''alterus'' and ''tucumanensis'' as subspecies of ''spegazzinii'' in a review of the mammals of Salta.<ref>D\u00edaz et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;24</ref> [[Guy Musser]] and Michael Carleton, in the 2005 third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'', also considered the three to represent the same species,<ref name=MC1099/> as did Ulyses Pardi\u00f1as and colleagues in a 2006 review of Argentinean [[Akodontini]].<ref>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;155</ref> Meanwhile, Carlos Galliari and Pardi\u00f1as had recognized ''Akodon leucolimnaeus'' as a true ''Akodon'', not a ''Necromys'', in 1995. Although associated with the ''Akodon boliviensis'' group, its precise status remained unclear.<ref>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1095</ref> The [[common name]] \"Catamarca akodont\" was proposed for this species.<ref name=MC1095/>\n\nIn 1980, Julio Contreras and Mar\u00eda Rosi<ref name=Pea47>Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, p.&nbsp;47</ref> identified an ''Akodon'' from the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] as ''Akodon varius neocenus'' (now ''[[Akodon neocenus]]''), but the following year, they identified it as a new species, named ''Akodon minoprioi'' in a presentation at a scientific meeting. This name was never formally validated.<ref name=Bea216>Braun et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;216</ref> In 2000, Janet Braun and colleagues formally named this species ''Akodon oenos'' and allied it to the ''[[Akodon varius]]'' species group. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''oenos'', is Greek for \"wine\" and refers to the animal's occurrence in the wine-producing region of Mendoza.<ref name=Bea218>Braun et al., 2000, p.&nbsp;218</ref> The common names \"Monte akodont\"<ref name=MC1097>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1097</ref> and \"wine grass mouse\"<ref>Duff and Lawson, 2004</ref> were proposed for this species.\n\nIn 2010, Pablo Jayat and colleagues reviewed the members of the ''[[Akodon boliviensis]]'' species group, including ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] or molecular characters between animals belonging to ''A.&nbsp;alterus'', ''A.&nbsp;leucolimnaeus'', ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', and ''A.&nbsp;tucumanensis'', and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species.<ref name=Jea32/> Although genetic variation is relatively high within ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'', there is no clear geographic structure among [[haplotype]]s from different regions.<ref name=Jea29/> The next year, Ulyses Pardi\u00f1as and colleagues concluded that ''A.&nbsp;oenos'', which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the ''A.&nbsp;varius'' species group, was in fact another [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref name=\"Pea47\"/> The proliferation of scientific names for this one species occurred because of the terseness of the original description of ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii'',<ref name=Jea28>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;28</ref> and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within ''A.&nbsp;spegazzinii''.<ref name=Jea32>Jayat et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;32</ref>\n\n{{cladogram|align=right|caption=Relationships within the ''Akodon boliviensis'' species group according to analysis of data from the cytochrome ''b'' gene<ref name=phylogenetics>Jayat et al., 2010, fig.&nbsp;1; D'El\u00eda et al., 2011, fig.&nbsp;6; Pardi\u00f1as et al., 2011, fig.&nbsp;1</ref>|clades=\n{{clade|style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%\n|label1=''Akodon boliviensis'' group\n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1=''[[Akodon sylvanus]]''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Akodon polopi]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Akodon boliviensis]]''\n            |2='''''Akodon spegazzinii'''''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Akodon caenosus]]''\n      |2=''[[Akodon lutescens]]''\n      |3=''[[Akodon subfuscus]]''\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nAccording to [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]] from the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] gene, ''Akodon spegazzinii'' is most closely related to ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' and more distantly to other members of the ''A.&nbsp;boliviensis'' species group, including ''[[Akodon polopi]]'' and ''[[Akodon sylvanus]]''.<ref name=phylogenetics/> The ''boliviensis'' group is part of the highly diverse genus ''[[Akodon]]'' and thereby of the tribe [[Akodontini]], which includes about 90 species of South American rodents.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition. He later read ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'', listened to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation, and read on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI&t=2369s |title=Peter Jackson Exeter interview, 2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition. He later read ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'', listened to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation, and read on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI&t=2369s |title=Peter Jackson Exeter interview, 2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books. To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson takes a more [[chronology|chronological]] approach to the story than did Tolkien. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.<ref name=\"FOTR SEE\" />\n\nEarlier versions of the script included additional characters like Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Imrahil and Forlong.<ref name=\"quest\">{{Cite book |author=Brian Sibley |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-717558-2 |location=London |pages=329\u201387 |chapter=Quest for the Ring|author-link=Brian Sibley}}</ref> At one point, Jackson even considered reintroducing Tom Bombadil in a cameo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugEFwc5bMB8&list=PLCZgoww3m_249koI9ngypkNy5kKy3J3SX&index=70 |title=Philippa Boyens interview in Comic-Con, 2014 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Gimli was going to swear throughout the films, and Arwen would join the Fellowship in Rohan and share a nude scene with Aragorn in the pools of the Glittering Caves.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Anything You Can Imagine |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=200\u2013203}}</ref>\n\nJackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, [[prosthetic makeup]], creatures, and miniatures.

With Jackson's future films, motion-capture technology had been pushed so far that it became referred to as \"digital makeup\", although it was later clarified that during ''The Lord of the Rings'' period, it was still fairly reliant on the CG animators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://otherthings.com/blog/2014/05/randy-cook-speaks-out-on-digital-makeup/|title=RANDY COOK SPEAKS OUT ON \u201cDIGITAL MAKEUP\u201d|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within [[Protected areas of New Zealand|New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks]].

He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

[[Ethiopia]]. This ''tabia'' includes the rock church of Debre Sema'it, as well as Arefa, reputedly birthplace of the [[Queen of Sheba]].

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

{"title_page": "Keyword research", "text_new": "\n\n\n'''Keyword research''' is a practice [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) professionals use to find and research alternative search terms that people enter into search engines while looking for a similar subject. Search engine optimization professionals research additional [[Index term|keywords]], which they use to achieve better rankings in search engines. Once they find a niche keyword, they expand on it to find similar keywords. Keyword suggestion tools usually aid the process, like the [[Google Keyword Planner|Google Ads Keyword Planner]], keywords Research which offers a [[thesaurus]] and alternative keyword suggestions or by looking into Google Suggest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en|title=Search using autocomplete - Search Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Importance of research==\n\n=== Keyword research  ===\nThe objective of keyword research is to generate, with good [[precision and recall]], a large number of terms that are highly relevant yet non-obvious to the given input keyword.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=A|author2=Motwani, R |title=Keyword Generation for Search Engine Advertising|journal=Data Mining Workshops|year=2006|page=493|doi=10.1109/ICDMW.2006.104|isbn=978-0-7695-2702-4}}</ref> The process of keyword research involves brainstorming and the use of keyword research tools. To achieve the best SEO results, it is important to optimize a website as well as [[backlink]]s for the most relevant keywords. It is good practice to search for related keywords that have low competition and still a high number of searches. This makes it easier to achieve a higher rank in [[search engines]] which usually results in higher [[web traffic]]. The downside of this practice is that the website is optimized for alternative keywords instead of the main keyword; main keywords might be very difficult to rank for due to high competition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jerkovic|first=John|title=SEO Warrior|year=2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-0596157074|pages=213\u2013236}}</ref> There are three essential concepts to consider when conducting keyword research. Good keywords are closely related to the subject of the website. Most search engines use an internal quality system to check website relevance related to possible keywords, a non-relevant keyword is unlikely to rank well for a website.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=A. Malaga|title=Worst Practices in Search Engine Optimization|journal=Commun. ACM|year=2008|volume=51|issue=12|pages=147|doi=10.1145/1409360.1409388}}</ref> Good Keyword that are highly competitive are less likely to rank in the top. Keywords that have no monthly searches generate no traffic and therefore are useless for SEO. [[Keyword stuffing]] in a web page should be avoided.\n\n=== Types of keywords ===\nFrom SEO practice point there are 3 categories of keywords which for professionals of Search engine optimization are important.\n\n* Short-tail keywords which are known in SEO World as \"seed\", \"main\" or \"money\" keywords which are consisted mostly from one to two words and they are mostly generic but with very high volume searches.\n* Middle-tail keyword which in SEO World are known as \"targeted\" or \"intent\" keywords because usually points to what the product is for, what kind of service is or what info some persona is seeking.They have three to four keywords. They have less volume searches than the generic ones.\n* Long-tail keywords are basically the most wanted and targeted keywords upon the keyword research from the professionals of Search Engine Optimization because if there is some commercial intent they have high rate of conversion. These keywords are very detail keywords and unique ones because the specific in them and intent they have and they have over 5 words in it.\n\n=== Research examples ===\nA very popular and highly competitive keyword on [[Google search engine]] is \"making money.\" It has  85,300,000 search results, meaning that millions of websites are relevant or competing for that keyword. Keyword research starts with finding all possible word combinations that are relevant to the \"making money\" keyword. For example, a keyword \"acquiring money\" has significantly fewer search results, only 61 000 000, but it has the same meaning as \"making money.\" Another way is to be more specific about a keyword by adding additional filters. Keyword \"making money online from home in Canada\" is less competitive on a global scale and therefore easier to rank for.

Search engine optimization professionals research additional [[Index term|keywords]], which they use to achieve better rankings in search engines. Once they find a niche keyword, they expand on it to find similar keywords. Keyword suggestion tools usually aid the process, like the [[Google Keyword Planner|Google Ads Keyword Planner]], which offers a [[thesaurus]] and alternative keyword suggestions or by looking into Google Suggest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en|title=Search using autocomplete - Search Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Importance of research==\n\n=== Keyword research  ===\nThe objective of keyword research is to generate, with good [[precision and recall]], a large number of terms that are highly relevant yet non-obvious to the given input keyword.<ref>{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=A|author2=Motwani, R |title=Keyword Generation for Search Engine Advertising|journal=Data Mining Workshops|year=2006|page=493|doi=10.1109/ICDMW.2006.104|isbn=978-0-7695-2702-4}}</ref> The process of keyword research involves brainstorming and the use of keyword research tools. To achieve the best SEO results, it is important to optimize a website as well as [[backlink]]s for the most relevant keywords. It is good practice to search for related keywords that have low competition and still a high number of searches. This makes it easier to achieve a higher rank in [[search engines]] which usually results in higher [[web traffic]]. The downside of this practice is that the website is optimized for alternative keywords instead of the main keyword; main keywords might be very difficult to rank for due to high competition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jerkovic|first=John|title=SEO Warrior|year=2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-0596157074|pages=213\u2013236}}</ref> There are three essential concepts to consider when conducting keyword research. Good keywords are closely related to the subject of the website. Most search engines use an internal quality system to check website relevance related to possible keywords, a non-relevant keyword is unlikely to rank well for a website.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=A. Malaga|title=Worst Practices in Search Engine Optimization|journal=Commun. ACM|year=2008|volume=51|issue=12|pages=147|doi=10.1145/1409360.1409388}}</ref> Good Keyword that are highly competitive are less likely to rank in the top. Keywords that have no monthly searches generate no traffic and therefore are useless for SEO. [[Keyword stuffing]] in a web page should be avoided.\n\n=== Types of keywords ===\nFrom SEO practice point there are 3 categories of keywords which for professionals of Search engine optimization are important.\n\n* Short-tail keywords which are known in SEO World as \"seed\", \"main\" or \"money\" keywords which are consisted mostly from one to two words and they are mostly generic but with very high volume searches.\n* Middle-tail keyword which in SEO World are known as \"targeted\" or \"intent\" keywords because usually points to what the product is for, what kind of service is or what info some persona is seeking.They have three to four keywords. They have less volume searches than the generic ones.\n* Long-tail keywords are basically the most wanted and targeted keywords upon the keyword research from the professionals of Search Engine Optimization because if there is some commercial intent they have high rate of conversion. These keywords are very detail keywords and unique ones because the specific in them and intent they have and they have over 5 words in it.\n\n=== Research examples ===\nA very popular and highly competitive keyword on [[Google search engine]] is \"making money.\" It has  85,300,000 search results, meaning that millions of websites are relevant or competing for that keyword. Keyword research starts with finding all possible word combinations that are relevant to the \"making money\" keyword. For example, a keyword \"acquiring money\" has significantly fewer search results, only 61 000 000, but it has the same meaning as \"making money.\" Another way is to be more specific about a keyword by adding additional filters.
