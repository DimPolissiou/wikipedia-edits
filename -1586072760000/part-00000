The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883-1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883-1967), he was born at [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nHe was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the Royal Navy in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.

The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883-1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883-1967), he was born at [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nHe was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the Royal Navy in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.

Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. [[Rugby union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6&nbsp;million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36&nbsp;million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].

This document, titled '119 countries... 6.6 million players' adds the number of registered and unregistered players reported by each country. Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. [[Rugby union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6&nbsp;million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36&nbsp;million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].  Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team|accessdate=8 March 2020|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]].

The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum.

Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out jumpers.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 6\"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side.

The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 7\"/> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 8\">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bompa|Claro|2008|p=62}}</ref>\n\n====Three quarters====\nThere are four three quarter positions: two [[Rugby union positions#Centre|centres]] (inside and outside) and two [[Rugby union positions#Wing|wings]] (left and right). The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 7\"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline.

He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour.

He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on March 16. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Recruiting/First Medical Board/Fit For Active Service\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 66\n| date = 1917-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170317.2.31\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\nHe was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the [[North Shore Albions]] without having formalised a transfer. [[Grafton Athletic]] protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union/Executive Committee Meeting\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 123\n| date = 1917-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170524.2.17\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>. It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 129\n| date = 1917-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170531.2.18\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.

Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.\n\nIn May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team.

He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour. He lived in Auckland and played for the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[North Shore Albions]] senior teams from 1915 to 1920.\n\n<ref name=\"Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/Dougie-McGregor/summary.html|title=Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org|publisher=rugbyleagueproject.org|date=31 December 2017|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nArthur Matthews began his career playing for [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He played for them in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|1915]] and [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 seasons]]. He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on March 16. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Recruiting/First Medical Board/Fit For Active Service\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 66\n| date = 1917-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170317.2.31\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\nHe was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the [[North Shore Albions]] without having formalised a transfer. [[Grafton Athletic]] protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union/Executive Committee Meeting\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 123\n| date = 1917-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170524.2.17\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>. It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 129\n| date = 1917-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170531.2.18\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.

Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.\n\nIn May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team.

Frank Baum]] is a children's novel, the seventh in the [[Oz series]]. Characters include the [[List of Oz characters#Woozy|Woozy]], [[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]] \"the Unlucky\", [[List of Oz characters#Unc Nunkie|Unc Nunkie]], [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]], [[List of Oz characters#Patchwork Girl|Scraps]] (the patchwork girl), and others. The book was first published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by [[John R. Neill]]. In 1914, Baum adapted the book to film through his \"[[Oz Film Manufacturing Company]].\"\n\nIn the previous Oz book, ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] was used to isolate Oz from all contact with the outside world. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardship.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=171}}</ref> In the prologue, he reconciles Oz's isolation with the appearance of a new Oz book by explaining that he contacted [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in Oz via [[wireless telegraphy]], and she obtained Ozma's permission to tell Baum this story.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=176}}</ref> \n\nThe book was dedicated to Sumner Hamilton Britton, the young son of one of its publishers, Sumner Charles Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]], known as Ojo the Unlucky, lives in poverty with his laconic uncle [[Unc Nunkie]] in the woods of the [[Munchkin Country]] in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. They visit their neighbor, the magician [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]] who is about to complete the six-year process of preparing the magical Powder of Life, which can bring inanimate objects to life. Pipt's wife has constructed a life-sized stuffed girl out of [[patchwork]], and wishes her husband to animate her to serve as an obedient household servant. They also meet another of Pipt's creations, Bungle, an extremely vain talking cat made of glass. The Powder of Life successfully animates the patchwork girl, but an accident causes both Pipt's wife and Unc Nunkie to be turned to stone. Dr. Pipt tells Ojo that he must obtain five ingredients to make a compound to counteract the petrifaction spell.\n\nOjo and the patchwork girl, who calls herself Scraps, along with Bungle, embark on a journey to obtain the magic ingredients: a six-leaved clover, the wing of a yellow butterfly, water from a dark well, a drop of oil from a live man's body, and three hairs from a Woozy's tail. Scraps exhibits a wild, carefree personality, and is prone to spontaneous recitation of nonsense poetry. After several adventures, they meet a Woozy, a blocky quadruped who agrees to let them have three hairs from its tail. But they are unable to remove the hairs, so they take the Woozy along with them.\n\nThe party is captured by large animate plants, but they are rescued by the fortuitous arrival of the [[Shaggy Man]]. He leads them to the [[Emerald City]] to meet [[Ozma]], but warns Ojo that picking a six-leaved clover is forbidden by law in Oz. Along the way they meet the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who is quite smitten with Scraps, as she is with him. Just outside the Emerald City, Ojo sees a six-leaved clover by the road and, believing himself to be unobserved, picks it. When they arrive at the city gates, the [[Soldier with the Green Whiskers]] approaches them and announces that Ojo is under arrest.\n\nBrought to trial before Ozma, Ojo confesses and Ozma pardons him and allows him to keep the clover. [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and the Scarecrow join Ojo and Scraps as they continue their search for the remaining ingredients. Along the way they meet [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], the playful but annoying Tottenhots, and the man-eating 21-foot-tall giant [[List of Oz characters (created by Baum)#Mr. Yoop|Mr. Yoop]], before reaching the subterranean dwellings of the Hoppers, who each have just one leg, and the neighboring Horners, who each have one horn on their head. The two groups are on the verge of war due to a misunderstanding, but Scraps reconciles them. A grateful Horner leads the group to a well in a dark [[radium]] mine, and Ojo collects a flask of water from it.\n\nThe group continues to the castle of the [[Tin Woodsman]] who rules the [[Winkie Country]], since yellow butterflies are most likely to be found in that yellow-dominated quadrant of Oz. While talking to the Tin Woodsman, Ojo notices a drop of oil about to drip from his body, and he catches it in a vial. He explains that he now has all the ingredients except one. But when he describes the last one, the Tin Woodsman is horrified at the idea of killing an innocent butterfly, and forbids them from doing so in his realm. Ojo is devastated, but the Tin Woodsman proposes that they all travel back to the Emerald City to ask Ozma's advice.\n\nOzma tells them that Dr. Pipt has been practicing magic illegally and has therefore been deprived of his powers. But the petrified Unc Nunkie and Pipt's wife have been brought to the Emerald City and as they all watch, the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] restores them to life. Ojo and Unc Nunkie are given a new house to live in near the Emerald City and the Tin Woodsman calls Ojo \"Ojo the Lucky\".\n\n==Background and analysis==\nIn reference to ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz,'' one of Baum's letters to his publisher, Sumner Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]], offers unusual insight on Baum's manner of creating his Oz fantasies:\n\n{{quote|\nA lot of thought is required on one of these fairy tales. The odd characters are a sort of inspiration, liable to strike me at any time, but the plot and plan of adventures takes me considerable time...I live with it day by day, jotting down on odd slips of paper the various ideas that occur and in this way getting my materials together. The new Oz book is at this stage....But...it's a long way from being ready for the printer yet. I must rewrite it, stringing the incidents into consecutive order, elaborating the characters, etc. Then it's typewritten. Then it's revised, retypewritten and sent on to Reilly and Britton.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|pages=179\u201380}}</ref>}}\n\nThe same correspondence (November 23\u20137, 1912) discusses the deleted Chapter 21 of the book, \"The Garden of Meats.\" The text of the chapter has not survived, but Neill's illustrations and their captions still exist. The deleted chapter dealt with a race of vegetable people comparable to the Mangaboos in Chapters 4\u20136 of ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]].'' The vegetable people grow what Baum elsewhere calls \"meat people,\" apparently for food; Neill's pictures show plants with the heads of human children<ref>Bodiless human heads are rather a pre-occupation with Baum; they occur repeatedly in his fantasies, ''Ozma of Oz'', Chapter 6 and ''The Tin Woodman of Oz,'' Chapter 18 being two examples.</ref> being watered by their growers. (This is thematically connected with the anthropophagous plants in Chapter 10 of ''Patchwork Girl.'') Frank Reilly tactfully wrote to Baum that the material was not \"in harmony with your other fairy stories,\" and would generate \"considerable adverse criticism.\" Baum saw his point; the chapter was dropped.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|pages=198\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAt least at one point in his life, Baum stated that he considered ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz'' \"one of the two best books of my career\", the other being ''[[The Sea Fairies]].''<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|page=184}}</ref> The book was a popular success, selling just over 17,000 copies\u2014though this was somewhat lower than the total for the previous book, ''The Emerald City of Oz,'' and marked the start of a trend in declining sales for the Oz books that would not reverse until ''[[The Tin Woodman of Oz]]'' in 1918.\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)}}\nBaum also wrote a musical stage adaptation of the book, circa 1913, with composer [[Louis F. Gottschalk]]; however, this musical was never staged. Excerpts have occasionally been performed at various annual conventions of [[The International Wizard of Oz Club]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|first=Michael O.|last=Riley|title=Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L.

Characters include the [[List of Oz characters#Woozy|Woozy]], [[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]] \"the Unlucky\", [[List of Oz characters#Unc Nunkie|Unc Nunkie]], [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]], [[List of Oz characters#Patchwork Girl|Scraps]] (the patchwork girl), and others. The book was first published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by [[John R. Neill]]. In 1914, Baum adapted the book to film through his \"[[Oz Film Manufacturing Company]].\"\n\nIn the previous Oz book, ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] was used to isolate Oz from all contact with the outside world. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardship.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=171}}</ref> In the prologue, he reconciles Oz's isolation with the appearance of a new Oz book by explaining that he contacted [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in Oz via [[wireless telegraphy]], and she obtained Ozma's permission to tell Baum this story.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1997|page=176}}</ref> \n\nThe book was dedicated to Sumner Hamilton Britton, the young son of one of its publishers, Sumner Charles Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ojo the Lucky|Ojo]], known as Ojo the Unlucky, lives in poverty with his laconic uncle [[Unc Nunkie]] in the woods of the [[Munchkin Country]] in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. They visit their neighbor, the magician [[List of Oz characters#Dr. Pipt|Dr. Pipt]] who is about to complete the six-year process of preparing the magical Powder of Life, which can bring inanimate objects to life. Pipt's wife has constructed a life-sized stuffed girl out of [[patchwork]], and wishes her husband to animate her to serve as an obedient household servant. They also meet another of Pipt's creations, Bungle, an extremely vain talking cat made of glass. The Powder of Life successfully animates the patchwork girl, but an accident causes both Pipt's wife and Unc Nunkie to be turned to stone. Dr. Pipt tells Ojo that he must obtain five ingredients to make a compound to counteract the petrifaction spell.\n\nOjo and the patchwork girl, who calls herself Scraps, along with Bungle, embark on a journey to obtain the magic ingredients: a six-leaved clover, the wing of a yellow butterfly, water from a dark well, a drop of oil from a live man's body, and three hairs from a Woozy's tail. Scraps exhibits a wild, carefree personality, and is prone to spontaneous recitation of nonsense poetry. After several adventures, they meet a Woozy, a blocky quadruped who agrees to let them have three hairs from its tail. But they are unable to remove the hairs, so they take the Woozy along with them.\n\nThe party is captured by large animate plants, but they are rescued by the fortuitous arrival of the [[Shaggy Man]]. He leads them to the [[Emerald City]] to meet [[Ozma]], but warns Ojo that picking a six-leaved clover is forbidden by law in Oz. Along the way they meet the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who is quite smitten with Scraps, as she is with him. Just outside the Emerald City, Ojo sees a six-leaved clover by the road and, believing himself to be unobserved, picks it. When they arrive at the city gates, the [[Soldier with the Green Whiskers]] approaches them and announces that Ojo is under arrest.\n\nBrought to trial before Ozma, Ojo confesses and Ozma pardons him and allows him to keep the clover. [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and the Scarecrow join Ojo and Scraps as they continue their search for the remaining ingredients. Along the way they meet [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], the playful but annoying Tottenhots, and the man-eating 21-foot-tall giant [[List of Oz characters (created by Baum)#Mr. Yoop|Mr. Yoop]], before reaching the subterranean dwellings of the Hoppers, who each have just one leg, and the neighboring Horners, who each have one horn on their head. The two groups are on the verge of war due to a misunderstanding, but Scraps reconciles them. A grateful Horner leads the group to a well in a dark [[radium]] mine, and Ojo collects a flask of water from it.\n\nThe group continues to the castle of the [[Tin Woodsman]] who rules the [[Winkie Country]], since yellow butterflies are most likely to be found in that yellow-dominated quadrant of Oz. While talking to the Tin Woodsman, Ojo notices a drop of oil about to drip from his body, and he catches it in a vial. He explains that he now has all the ingredients except one. But when he describes the last one, the Tin Woodsman is horrified at the idea of killing an innocent butterfly, and forbids them from doing so in his realm. Ojo is devastated, but the Tin Woodsman proposes that they all travel back to the Emerald City to ask Ozma's advice.\n\nOzma tells them that Dr. Pipt has been practicing magic illegally and has therefore been deprived of his powers. But the petrified Unc Nunkie and Pipt's wife have been brought to the Emerald City and as they all watch, the [[Wizard of Oz]] restores them to life. Ojo and Unc Nunkie are given a new house to live in near the Emerald City and the Tin Woodsman calls Ojo \"Ojo the Lucky\".\n\n==Background and analysis==\nIn reference to ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz,'' one of Baum's letters to his publisher, Sumner Britton of [[Reilly & Britton]], offers unusual insight on Baum's manner of creating his Oz fantasies:\n\n{{quote|\nA lot of thought is required on one of these fairy tales. The odd characters are a sort of inspiration, liable to strike me at any time, but the plot and plan of adventures takes me considerable time...I live with it day by day, jotting down on odd slips of paper the various ideas that occur and in this way getting my materials together. The new Oz book is at this stage....But...it's a long way from being ready for the printer yet. I must rewrite it, stringing the incidents into consecutive order, elaborating the characters, etc. Then it's typewritten. Then it's revised, retypewritten and sent on to Reilly and Britton.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|pages=179\u201380}}</ref>}}\n\nThe same correspondence (November 23\u20137, 1912) discusses the deleted Chapter 21 of the book, \"The Garden of Meats.\" The text of the chapter has not survived, but Neill's illustrations and their captions still exist. The deleted chapter dealt with a race of vegetable people comparable to the Mangaboos in Chapters 4\u20136 of ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]].'' The vegetable people grow what Baum elsewhere calls \"meat people,\" apparently for food; Neill's pictures show plants with the heads of human children<ref>Bodiless human heads are rather a pre-occupation with Baum; they occur repeatedly in his fantasies, ''Ozma of Oz'', Chapter 6 and ''The Tin Woodman of Oz,'' Chapter 18 being two examples.</ref> being watered by their growers. (This is thematically connected with the anthropophagous plants in Chapter 10 of ''Patchwork Girl.'') Frank Reilly tactfully wrote to Baum that the material was not \"in harmony with your other fairy stories,\" and would generate \"considerable adverse criticism.\" Baum saw his point; the chapter was dropped.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|pages=198\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAt least at one point in his life, Baum stated that he considered ''The Patchwork Girl of Oz'' \"one of the two best books of my career\", the other being ''[[The Sea Fairies]].''<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|2002|page=184}}</ref> The book was a popular success, selling just over 17,000 copies\u2014though this was somewhat lower than the total for the previous book, ''The Emerald City of Oz,'' and marked the start of a trend in declining sales for the Oz books that would not reverse until ''[[The Tin Woodman of Oz]]'' in 1918.\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)}}\nBaum also wrote a musical stage adaptation of the book, circa 1913, with composer [[Louis F. Gottschalk]]; however, this musical was never staged. Excerpts have occasionally been performed at various annual conventions of [[The International Wizard of Oz Club]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|first=Michael O.|last=Riley|title=Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Natalie|title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl|url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|access-date=May 13, 2019|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' electronically masked voices.

For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment, and the show's budget was lowered as a result.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Dade|title=''The Masked Singer'' Renewed For Third Season, Gets Post-Super Bowl Slot On|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-masked-singer-season-3-to-premiere-after-super-bowl-liv-on-fox-1202613462/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=May 13, 2019|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-launching-unscripted-studio-masked-singer-1209087|title=Fox Launching Unscripted Studio With ''The Masked Singer'' (Exclusive)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEntering into the third season, the series's production crew had to work out better voice modulation routines as they had found fans of the show were able to remove the modulation and identify the speaking from previous seasons.

Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's mask was [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design. Similarly, rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design by creating a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. The Egg costume, which was requested by a contestant, was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]].\" It incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the Butterfly costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina said.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, she had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nToybina won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] in the Excellence in Variety, Reality-Competition, Live Television category in recognition of her work on the season two finale.<ref name=\"CAG 2020\">{{cite web|last=Tangcay|first=Jazz|title=''Hustlers'', ''Jojo Rabbit'' and ''Queen & Slim'' Receive Costume Design Nominations|url=https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 3, 2020|date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205185900/https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|archive-date=February 5, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Season 3====\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Natalie|title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl|url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|access-date=May 13, 2019|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' electronically masked voices.

Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant.

For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment, and the show's budget was lowered as a result.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Dade|title=''The Masked Singer'' Renewed For Third Season, Gets Post-Super Bowl Slot On|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-masked-singer-season-3-to-premiere-after-super-bowl-liv-on-fox-1202613462/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=May 13, 2019|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-launching-unscripted-studio-masked-singer-1209087|title=Fox Launching Unscripted Studio With ''The Masked Singer'' (Exclusive)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEntering into the third season, the series's production crew had to work out better voice modulation routines as they had found fans of the show were able to remove the modulation and identify the speaking from previous seasons.

Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's mask was [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design. Similarly, rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design by creating a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. The Egg costume, which was requested by a contestant, was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]].\" It incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the Butterfly costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina said.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, she had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nToybina won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] in the Excellence in Variety, Reality-Competition, Live Television category in recognition of her work on the season two finale.<ref name=\"CAG 2020\">{{cite web|last=Tangcay|first=Jazz|title=''Hustlers'', ''Jojo Rabbit'' and ''Queen & Slim'' Receive Costume Design Nominations|url=https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 3, 2020|date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205185900/https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|archive-date=February 5, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Season 3====\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

The proposed rationale was that a national games will help improve the sports quality, produces and encourages athletes to participate in sports at state level, improve officials performance, encourages the building of new venues and upgrading of existing sport venues at state level and cultivate national integration spirit among Malaysian community. At first, the inaugural games was proposed to be held from 15 August to 2 September 1985 and consist of 6 sports such as tennis, table tennis, cycling, athletics, sepak takraw and volleyball.<ref name=Sukma/> However, a new proposal to involve more sport was submitted by the public to the National Sports Council of Malaysia, which accept the proposal and made the decision to held the games every two years begins 1986 onwards and alternate with the Southeast Asian Games. \n\nThe first Sukma Games were held in Kuala Lumpur from 19\u201326 April 1986 participated by more than 3849 athletes from 13 States of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory, The Malaysian Universities Sports Council (MASUM), Royal Malaysian Police and the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM). The third edition was held in Sarawak in 1990, making it the first time the Sukma Games was held in the state and also the first time in East Malaysia.\n\nAt the 6th Sukma Games in Pahang in 1996, Brunei, Labuan and the Malaysian Schools Sports Council (MSSM) made their debut, while the Malaysian Armed Forces ceased to participate and the Northern Territory of Australia only participates at the 9th Sukma Games in Sabah in 2002. At the 10th Sukma Games in 2004 in Negeri Sembilan, both the Schools Sports Council and Universities Sports Council ceased to participate while at the 11th edition in Kedah in 2006, both Kuala Lumpur and Labuan team merged to form the Federal Territory team following the administration merger of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and the Putrajaya while the Police participates at the games for the last time.\n\nA decision was made by the National Sports Council on 27 May 2010 to held the games annually from 2011 onwards in an effort to develop and democratise all sports including optional sports in the country. The odd year games was held in Kuala Lumpur by the National Sports Council and involve only optional sports, while the even year games was held in member states of the country and involve only core sports. The odd year games was however abolished by the council in 2015, citing fully packed state sports agenda and high cost for state sport councils to fund a Sukma Games contingent every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&dt=0602&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_05.htm|title=Sukma 2011-an Effort 'Democratising' Sports In The Country|publisher=[[Bernama]]|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/06/14/sarawak-in-bottom-three-at-sukma-xiv/|title=Sarawak in bottom three at Sukma XIV|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2015|newspaper=[[The Borneo Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Sport/Other-Sport/2015/02/25/Sports-bodies-can-hold-their-own-after-Sukma-cancelled/|title=Sports Bodies Can Hold Their Own (Competition) After Sukma Cancelled|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/02/26/pembatalan-sukma-2015-turut-kecewakan-msns/|title=2015 Sukma Games Cancelled|work=[[Borneo Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&dt=0612&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_05.htm|title=14th Malaysian Games overall winner to be crowned tomorrow}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=1211&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_06.htm|title=Sukma 2011 to feature only selective sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=0928&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_09.htm|title=Only 24 sports for Sukma 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parlimen: Kos Persediaan Atlet Antara Punca Sukma 2015 Ditangguh - Khairy|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/sukan/kos-persediaan-atlet-antara-punca-sukma-2015-ditangguh-khairy-1.96786}}</ref>\n\n==Participating teams==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sukma2002.com.my/others/k_kontingen.asp|title=Contingent code|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109013304/http://sukma2002.com.my/others/k_kontingen.asp|archivedate=9 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flag|Brunei}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(BRU)</span>{{ref|n3|3|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Federal Territory (Malaysia)|name=Federal Territory}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(WIL)</span>\n* {{flag|Johor}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(JOH)</span>\n* {{flag|Kedah}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KED)</span>\n* {{flag|Kelantan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KEL)</span>\n* {{flag|Kuala Lumpur}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KUL)</span>{{ref|n1|1|noid=noid}} {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Labuan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(LBN)</span>{{ref|n1|1|noid=noid}} {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Malacca}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MEL)</span>\n* [[File:Flag of the Malaysian Armed Forces.svg|25px]] [[Malaysian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(ATM)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n7|7|noid=noid}}\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} [[Education in Malaysia|Universities]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MSU)</span> {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n4|4|noid=noid}}\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} [[Education in Malaysia|Schools]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MSM)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n5|5|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Negeri Sembilan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(NSE)</span>\n* {{flag|Northern Territory}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(NTA)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n3|3|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Pahang}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PAH)</span>\n* {{flag|Perak}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PRK)</span>\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flag|Perlis}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PER)</span>\n* {{flag|Penang}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PEN)</span>\n* [[File:Flag of the Royal Malaysian Police.svg|25px]] [[Royal Malaysian Police|Police]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(POL)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n6|6|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Sabah}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SAB)</span>\n* {{flag|Sarawak}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SAR)</span>\n* {{flag|Selangor}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SEL)</span>\n* {{flag|Terengganu}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(TER)</span>\n{{col-end}}\n\n''Notes:''\n# {{note|n1}} [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]] participated as a combined [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] contingent since 2006.

The proposed rationale was that a national games will help improve the sports quality, produces and encourages athletes to participate in sports at state level, improve officials performance, encourages the building of new venues and upgrading of existing sport venues at state level and cultivate national integration spirit among Malaysian community. At first, the inaugural games was proposed to be held from 15 August to 2 September 1985 and consist of 6 sports such as tennis, table tennis, cycling, athletics, sepak takraw and volleyball.<ref name=Sukma/> However, a new proposal to involve more sport was submitted by the public to the National Sports Council of Malaysia, which accept the proposal and made the decision to held the games every two years begins 1986 onwards and alternate with the Southeast Asian Games. \n\nThe first Sukma Games were held in Kuala Lumpur from 19\u201326 April 1986 participated by more than 3849 athletes from 13 States of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory, The Malaysian Universities Sports Council (MASUM), Royal Malaysian Police and the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM). The third edition was held in Sarawak in 1990, making it the first time the Sukma Games was held in the state and also the first time in East Malaysia.\n\nAt the 6th Sukma Games in Pahang in 1996, Brunei, Labuan and the Malaysian Schools Sports Council (MSSM) made their debut, while the Malaysian Armed Forces ceased to participate and the Northern Territory of Australia only participates at the 9th Sukma Games in Sabah in 2002. At the 10th Sukma Games in 2004 in Negeri Sembilan, both the Schools Sports Council and Universities Sports Council ceased to participate while at the 11th edition in Kedah in 2006, both Kuala Lumpur and Labuan team merged to form the Federal Territory team following the administration merger of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and the Putrajaya while the Police participates at the games for the last time.\n\nA decision was made by the National Sports Council on 27 May 2010 to held the games annually from 2011 onwards in an effort to develop and democratise all sports including optional sports in the country. The odd year games was held in Kuala Lumpur by the National Sports Council and involve only optional sports, while the even year games was held in member states of the country and involve only core sports. The odd year games was however abolished by the council in 2015, citing fully packed state sports agenda and high cost for state sport councils to fund a Sukma Games contingent every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&dt=0602&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_05.htm|title=Sukma 2011-an Effort 'Democratising' Sports In The Country|publisher=[[Bernama]]|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/06/14/sarawak-in-bottom-three-at-sukma-xiv/|title=Sarawak in bottom three at Sukma XIV|date=June 14, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2015|newspaper=[[The Borneo Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Sport/Other-Sport/2015/02/25/Sports-bodies-can-hold-their-own-after-Sukma-cancelled/|title=Sports Bodies Can Hold Their Own (Competition) After Sukma Cancelled|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/02/26/pembatalan-sukma-2015-turut-kecewakan-msns/|title=2015 Sukma Games Cancelled|work=[[Borneo Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&dt=0612&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_05.htm|title=14th Malaysian Games overall winner to be crowned tomorrow}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=1211&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_06.htm|title=Sukma 2011 to feature only selective sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2010&dt=0928&pub=themessenger&sec=Sports&pg=sp_09.htm|title=Only 24 sports for Sukma 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Parlimen: Kos Persediaan Atlet Antara Punca Sukma 2015 Ditangguh - Khairy|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/sukan/kos-persediaan-atlet-antara-punca-sukma-2015-ditangguh-khairy-1.96786}}</ref>\n\n==Participating teams==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sukma2002.com.my/others/k_kontingen.asp|title=Contingent code|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109013304/http://sukma2002.com.my/others/k_kontingen.asp|archivedate=9 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flag|Brunei}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(BRU)</span>{{ref|n3|3|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Federal Territory (Malaysia)|name=Federal Territory}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(WIL)</span>\n* {{flag|Johor}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(JOH)</span>\n* {{flag|Kedah}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KED)</span>\n* {{flag|Kelantan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KEL)</span>\n* {{flag|Kuala Lumpur}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(KUL)</span>{{ref|n1|1|noid=noid}} {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Labuan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(LBN)</span>{{ref|n1|1|noid=noid}} {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Malacca}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MEL)</span>\n* [[File:Flag of the Malaysian Armed Forces.svg|25px]] [[Malaysian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(ATM)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n7|7|noid=noid}}\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} [[Education in Malaysia|Universities]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MSU)</span> {{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n4|4|noid=noid}}\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} [[Education in Malaysia|Schools]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(MSM)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n5|5|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Negeri Sembilan}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(NSE)</span>\n* {{flag|Northern Territory}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(NTA)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n3|3|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Pahang}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PAH)</span>\n* {{flag|Perak}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PRK)</span>\n{{col-3}}\n* {{flag|Perlis}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PER)</span>\n* {{flag|Penang}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(PEN)</span>\n* [[File:Flag of the Royal Malaysian Police.svg|25px]] [[Royal Malaysian Police|Police]] <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(POL)</span>{{ref|n2|2|noid=noid}} {{ref|n6|6|noid=noid}}\n* {{flag|Sabah}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SAB)</span>\n* {{flag|Sarawak}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SAR)</span>\n* {{flag|Selangor}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(SEL)</span>\n* {{flag|Terengganu}} <span style=\"font-size:90%;\">(TER)</span>\n{{col-end}}\n\n''Notes:''\n# {{note|n1}} [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Labuan]] and [[Putrajaya]] participated as a combined [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] contingent since 2006.

The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!

The program was established by Congress in 1991 to preserve and protect the nation's scenic but often less-traveled roads and promote [[tourism]] and economic development. The National Scenic Byways Program (NSBP) is administered by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).\n\nThe most scenic byways are designated '''All-American Roads''', which must meet two out of the six intrinsic qualities. The designation means they have features that do not exist elsewhere in the United States and are unique and important enough to be tourist destinations unto themselves. As of November 2010, there are 120&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and 31&nbsp;All-American Roads, located in 46&nbsp;states (all except [[Hawaii]], [[Nebraska]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Texas]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Federal Highway Administration |url = http://byways.org/press/listbyways.html |title = List of America's Byways |work = America's Byways |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = November 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe NSBP was established under the [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991, which provided $74.3&nbsp;million in discretionary grants. On May&nbsp;18, 1995, FHWA specified the intrinsic qualities that would serve as criteria for designating road as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads. In September U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Federico Pe\u00f1a]] announced the first 14&nbsp;National Scenic Byways and six All-American Roads. On June&nbsp;9, 1998, the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st&nbsp;Century]] (TEA-21) provided $148&nbsp;million to states so they could develop state roads to take advantage of the program.\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users]] (SAFETEA-LU), which provided $175&nbsp;million to states and Indian tribes. Most recently, on October&nbsp;16, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] designated 37&nbsp;new roads as National Scenic Byways and five new All-American Roads.<ref>{{cite web |author = National Scenic Byways Program |title = History of the Program |url = http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/history.html |work = Program Information |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |accessdate = August 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Requirements==\nNational Scenic Byways go through a nomination procedure. They must already be designated state scenic byways to be nominated (However, roads that meet all criteria for national designation but not state designation may be considered for national designation on a case-by-case basis).<ref name=policy>{{cite journal |first = Rodney E. |last = Slater |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-05-18/html/95-12211.htm |title = National Scenic Byways Program Interim Policy |journal = [[Federal Register]] |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |volume = 60 |issue = 96 |pages = 26759\u201362 |date = May 18, 1995 |accessdate = May 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Intrinsic qualities===\nFor designation as a National Scenic Byway a road must have one of six intrinsic qualities. To be designated an All-American Road, a road must have at least two of the six qualities.<ref name=policy/>\n\n*'''Scenic quality''' is the heightened visual experience derived from the view of natural and manmade elements of the visual environment of the scenic byway corridor. The characteristics of the landscape are strikingly distinct and offer a pleasing and most memorable visual experience.\n*'''Natural quality''' applies to those features in the visual environment that are in a relatively undisturbed state. These features predate the arrival of human populations and may include geological formations, [[fossil]]s, landform, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife. There may be evidence of human activity, but the natural features reveal minimal disturbances.\n*'''Historic quality''' encompasses legacies of the past that are distinctly associated with physical elements of the landscape, whether natural or manmade, that are of such historic significance that they educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past. The historic elements reflect the actions of people and may include buildings, settlement patterns, and other examples of human activity.\n*'''Cultural quality''' is evidence and expressions of the customs or traditions of a distinct group of people. Cultural features include, but are not limited to, crafts, music, dance, rituals, festivals, speech, food, special events, or [[vernacular architecture]].\n*'''Archeological quality''' involves those characteristics of the scenic byways corridor that are physical evidence of historic or prehistoric human life or activity. The scenic byway corridor's archeological interest, as identified through ruins, artifacts, structural remains, and other physical evidence have scientific significance that educate the viewer and stir an appreciation for the past.\n*'''Recreational quality''' involves outdoor recreational activities directly associated with and dependent upon the natural and cultural elements of the corridor's landscape. The recreational activities provide opportunities for active and passive recreational experiences. They include, but are not limited to, downhill skiing, rafting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Driving the road itself may qualify as a pleasurable recreational experience. The recreational activities may be seasonal, but the quality and importance of the recreational activities as seasonal operations must be well recognized.\n\n===Corridor management plans===\nA corridor management plan must also be developed, with community involvement, and the plan \"should provide for the conservation and enhancement of the byway's intrinsic qualities as well as the promotion of tourism and economic development\". The plan includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*A map identifying the corridor boundaries and the location of intrinsic qualities and different land uses within the corridor.\n*A strategy for maintaining and enhancing those intrinsic qualities.\n*A strategy describing how existing development might be enhanced and new development might be accommodated while still preserving the intrinsic qualities of the corridor.\n*A general review of the road's or highway's safety and accident record to identify any correctable faults in highway design, maintenance, or operations.\n*A signage plan that demonstrates how the State will insure and make the number and placement of signs more supportive of the visitor experience.\n*A narrative describing how the National Scenic Byway will be positioned for marketing.<ref name=policy/>\n\nCorridor management plans for All-American Roads must also include:<ref name=policy/>\n\n*A narrative on how the All-American Road would be promoted, interpreted, and marketed in order to attract travelers, especially those from other countries.\n*A plan to encourage the accommodation of increased tourism, if this is projected. Some demonstration that the roadway, lodging and dining facilities, roadside rest areas, and other tourist necessities will be adequate for the number of visitors induced by the byway's designation as an All-American Road.\n*A plan for addressing multi-lingual information needs.\n\nThe final step is when the highway (or highways) is approved for designation by the [[United States Secretary of Transportation]].<ref name=policy/>\n\n==List of byways==\n{{inc-transport|date=February 2017}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders hlist\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Type\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (mi)\n!scope=\"col\" | Length (km)\n!scope=\"col\" | State(s)\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Southern or western terminus\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Northern or eastern terminus\n!scope=\"col\" | Date designated\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{abbr|Ref(s)|References}}\n|-\n| bgcolor=e7e7ff align=center | NSB\n!
