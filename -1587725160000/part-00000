The elections were due to be held in July. In April, Man\u00e9 publicly accused the Minister of Defense and a group of officers in the armed forces of involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists. At the sixth [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] congress held May 1998, President [[Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira]] was re-elected president of the party.\n\n==Coup and civil war (1998\u20131999)==\nVieira dismissed the suspended Man\u00e9 and appointed General Humberto Gomes  to replace him on 6 June 1998.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw6898.html \"GUINEA BISSAU: Fighting in capital continues\"], IRIN-West Africa Update 224, 8 June 1998.</ref> On 7 June, rebelling troops led by Ansumane Man\u00e9 seized control of military barracks in [[Bissau]] as well as other strategic locations in the city, including the international airport. Man\u00e9 subsequently demanded  the resignation of Vieira and his administration and the conduct of free and democratic elections in July. With the support of 1,300 Senegalese and 400 [[Guinea]]n soldiers, troops loyal to the government attempted unsuccessfully to regain control of rebel held areas of the city and heavy fighting ensued.\n\nIn the following days more than 3,000 foreign nationals were evacuated from the capital by ship to Senegal. An estimated further 200,000 residents of Bissau fled the city, prompting fears of a [[humanitarian]] disaster, with the hostilities preventing aid organizations from distributing emergency food and medical supplies to the refugees. Fighting continued into July, with many members of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces reportedly defecting to the side of the rebels.\n\nOn 26 July, following mediation by a delegation from the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), the government and the rebels agreed to implement a truce. On 25 August, representatives of the government and the rebels met under the auspices of the CPLP and [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal Island]], [[Cape Verde]], where an agreement was reached to transform the existing truce into a [[Cease fire|cease-fire]]. The accord provided for the reopening of the international airport and for the deployment of international forces to maintain and supervise the cease-fire.\n\nIn September 1998, talks between the government and the rebels resumed in [[Abidjan]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]]. The rebels demanded that all Senegalese and Guinean forces be withdrawn from the country as a precondition to a definitive peace agreement, which was rejected by the government. The rebels, in turn, rejected a proposal for the establishment by Senegal of a [[buffer zone]] within Guinea-Bissau territory along the border with Casamance.\n\nIn October the rebels agreed to a government proposal for the creation of a [[demilitarized zone]] separating the opposing forces in the capital. Before the proposal could be formally endorsed, the cease-fire collapsed as fighting erupted in the capital and several other towns. On 20 October, the government imposed a nationwide curfew, and on the following day President Vieira declared a unilateral cease-fire.\n\nBy that time almost all of the government troops had defected to the side of rebel forces, which were believed to control approximately 99% of the country. On 23 October, Brigadier-General Man\u00e9 agreed to observe a 48-hour truce to allow Vieira time to clarify his proposals for a negotiated peace settlement and agreement was subsequently reached for direct talks to be held in [[Banjul]], [[The Gambia]]. At the talks, which took place on 29 October, the rebels confirmed that they would not seek Vieira's resignation.\n\nFurther talks held under the aegis of ECOWAS in [[Abuja|Abuja, Nigeria]], resulted in the signing of a peace accord on 1 November. Under the accord's terms, the two sides reaffirmed the cease-fire of 25 August and resolved that the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea Bissau be conducted simultaneously with the deployment of an [[ECOMOG]] (ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group) interposition force, which would guarantee security on the border with Senegal.\n\nIt was also agreed that a Government of National Unity would be established to include rebel representatives and that presidential and legislative elections would be held no later than March 1999. In early November 1998, an agreement was reached on the composition of a joint executive commission to implement the peace accord. Later that month the commission approved the structure of the new government, which was to comprise ten ministers and seven secretaries of state.\n\nOn 3 December, [[Francisco Fadul]] was appointed [[Heads of Government of Guinea-Bissau|Prime Minister]] and later that month Vieira and Man\u00e9 reached agreement on the allocation of portfolios to the two sides. The first contingent of 100 ECOMOG troops arrived in late December. At the same time, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1216|Resolution 1216]] which called for both parties to form a [[government of national unity]] and hold elections by the end of March 1999.\n\n=== 1999 ===\nIn January 1999, Fadul announced that presidential and legislative elections would not take place in March as envisaged in the Abuja accord, and would be delayed until the end of the year. Also in January agreement was reached between the government, rebels and ECOWAS on the strength of the ECOMOG interposition force, which was to comprise some 710 troops. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAt the end of January 1999, hostilities resumed in the capital resulting in numerous fatalities and the displacement of some 250,000 residents. On 9 February, talks between the government and the rebels produced agreement on a cease-fire that provided for the immediate withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops.\n\nAt a meeting held in [[Lom\u00e9, Togo]] on 17 February, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira and Ansumane Man\u00e9 pledged never again to resort to armed conflict. On 20 February the new Government of National Unity was announced. The [[disarmament]] of rebel troops and those loyal to the president, as provided for under the Abuja accord, began in early March. The withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops was completed that month following an extension of the deadline from 28 February to 16 March, owing to logistical problems.\n\nIn April, a report was released by the National People's Assembly, which exonerated Man\u00e9 on charges of trafficking arms to the Casamance rebels. Although the report, which had been due for release in June 1998 when hostilities began, called for the reinstatement of Man\u00e9 as Chief of Staff of the armed forces, it revealed that President Vieira's presidential guard had been heavily implicated in arms trafficking. The [[United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau]] was subsequently established to monitor the general elections and the implementation of the Abuja Agreement.\n\n===Second coup (May 1999)===\n[[File:Bissau former pres palace.jpg|thumb|300px|The war damaged and abandoned former presidential palace in the capital [[Bissau]].]]\n\nIn early May 1999, Vieira announced that legislative and presidential elections would take place on 28 December, but he was overthrown by the rebel [[military junta]] on 7 May, to widespread condemnation by the international community. Fighting had erupted in Bissau on the previous day when rebel troops seized stockpiles of weapons that had been held at the international airport since the disarmament of the rival forces in March.\n\nThe rebels, who claimed that their actions had been prompted by Vieira's refusal to allow his presidential guard to be disarmed, surrounded the presidential palace and forced its surrender. Vieira subsequently took refuge at the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] embassy, where on 10 May 1999 he signed an unconditional surrender.\n\n==Post-conflict events==\nThe President of the [[National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|National People's Assembly]], [[Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1]], was appointed acting president of the republic until elections were held. The Government of National Unity, including the ministers appointed by Vieira, remained in office. At a meeting of the ruling bodies of the PAIGC that month, [[Manuel Saturnino da Costa]] was appointed to replace Vieira as party leader.\n\nAt a tripartite meeting conducted in late May by representatives of the government, the military junta and the political parties, agreement was reached that Vieira should stand trial for his involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists and for political and economic crimes relating to his terms in office. Vieira subsequently agreed to stand trial, but only after receiving medical treatment abroad, after which he pledged to return to Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAt a meeting of ECOWAS foreign ministers held in Togo in May 1999, Vieira's overthrow was condemned and demands were made for him to be permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau. It was also decided that ECOMOG forces would be withdrawn from the country. The last ECOMOG troops left in early June.\n\nThat month Vieira was permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau to seek medical treatment in France. Sanh\u00e1 cited humanitarian reasons for allowing Vieira's departure, but stressed that he would return to stand trial. In the same month Sanh\u00e1 asserted that presidential and legislative elections would take place by 28 November. In July, [[constitutional amendment]]s were introduced that limited the tenure of presidential office to two terms and abolished the [[death penalty]]. It was also stipulated that the country's principal offices of state could only be held by Guinea-Bissau nationals born of Guinea-Bissau parents.\n\nOn 28 November 1999, [[Elections in Guinea-Bissau|presidential and legislative elections]] were held with the opposition [[Social Renewal Party (Guinea-Bissau)|Social Renewal Party]] (PRS) winning 38 of 102 seats making it the largest party represented in the National People's Assembly. The long ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) won 24 seats. The PRS presidential candidate, [[Kumba Ial\u00e1]], placed first winning 38.81% of the vote. In a run-off held on 16 January 2000, Ial\u00e1 easily defeated acting President Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1 of the PAIGC, winning 72% of the vote. He was sworn in on 17 February 2000.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n|last=Minahan\n|first=James \n|title= Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World\n|year=2002\n|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]\n|isbn=\n|url=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Guinea-Bissau topics}}\n{{Years in Guinea-Bissau}}\n{{Post-Cold War African conflicts}}\n\n[[Category:History of Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Africa]]\n[[Category:Civil wars post-1945]]\n[[Category:Separatist rebellion-based civil wars]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Guinea]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Senegal]]\n[[Category:1998 in Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:1999 in Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Proxy wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|image=[[File:Bissau - Abandoned tank.JPG|300 px]]\n|caption=An abandoned [[T-54/55]] from the civil war in [[Bissau]], 2003\n|conflict=Guinea-Bissau Civil War\n|date=7 June 1998 \u2013 10 May 1999\n|place=[[Guinea-Bissau]]\n|result=Ousting of President [[Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira]]\n|combatant1={{flag|Guinea-Bissau}}<br>{{flag|Senegal}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conflicttransform.net/Guinea.pdf|title=Conflict Transformation, Guinea-Bassau, The Military Crisis in Guinea-Bassau, Terhi Lehtinen|publisher=Conflicttransform.net|accessdate=12 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231130933/http://www.conflicttransform.net/Guinea.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> <br>{{flag|Guinea}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060222085322/http://www.conflicttransform.net/Guinea.pdf Conflict Transformation, Guinea-Bassau, The Military Crisis in Guinea-Bassau, Terhi Lehtinen]</ref><br>'''Supported by:'''<br>{{flag|France}}<ref name=\"academia1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1545250/Civil_War_in_Guinea-Bissau_June_1998-_May_1999 |title=Civil War in Guinea-Bissau: June 1998- May 1999. &#124;

The rebels, in turn, rejected a proposal for the establishment by Senegal of a [[buffer zone]] within Guinea-Bissau territory along the border with Casamance. \n\nIn October the rebels agreed to a government proposal for the creation of a [[demilitarized zone]] separating the opposing forces in the capital. Before the proposal could be formally endorsed, the cease-fire collapsed as fighting erupted in the capital and several other towns. On 20 October, the government imposed a nationwide curfew, and on the following day President Vieira declared a unilateral cease-fire. \n\nBy that time almost all of the government troops had defected to the side of rebel forces, which were believed to control approximately 99% of the country. On 23 October, Brigadier-General Man\u00e9 agreed to observe a 48-hour truce to allow Vieira time to clarify his proposals for a negotiated peace settlement and agreement was subsequently reached for direct talks to be held in [[Banjul]], [[The Gambia]]. At the talks, which took place on 29 October, the rebels confirmed that they would not seek Vieira's resignation.\n\nFurther talks held under the aegis of ECOWAS in [[Abuja|Abuja, Nigeria]], resulted in the signing of a peace accord on 1 November. Under the accord's terms, the two sides reaffirmed the cease-fire of 25 August and resolved that the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea Bissau be conducted simultaneously with the deployment of an [[ECOMOG]] (ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group) interposition force, which would guarantee security on the border with Senegal. \n\nIt was also agreed that a Government of National Unity would be established to include rebel representatives and that presidential and legislative elections would be held no later than March 1999. In early November 1998, an agreement was reached on the composition of a joint executive commission to implement the peace accord. Later that month the commission approved the structure of the new government, which was to comprise ten ministers and seven secretaries of state. \n\nOn 3 December, [[Francisco Fadul]] was appointed [[Heads of Government of Guinea-Bissau|Prime Minister]] and later that month Vieira and Man\u00e9 reached agreement on the allocation of portfolios to the two sides. The first contingent of 100 ECOMOG troops arrived in late December. At the same time, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1216|Resolution 1216]] which called for both parties to form a [[government of national unity]] and hold elections by the end of March 1999.\n\n=== 1999 ===\nIn January 1999, Fadul announced that presidential and legislative elections would not take place in March as envisaged in the Abuja accord, and would be delayed until the end of the year. Also in January agreement was reached between the government, rebels and ECOWAS on the strength of the ECOMOG interposition force, which was to comprise some 710 troops. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau. \n\nAt the end of January 1999, hostilities resumed in the capital resulting in numerous fatalities and the displacement of some 250,000 residents. On 9 February, talks between the government and the rebels produced agreement on a cease-fire that provided for the immediate withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops. \n\nAt a meeting held in [[Lom\u00e9, Togo]] on 17 February, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira and Ansumane Man\u00e9 pledged never again to resort to armed conflict. On 20 February the new Government of National Unity was announced. The [[disarmament]] of rebel troops and those loyal to the president, as provided for under the Abuja accord, began in early March. The withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops was completed that month following an extension of the deadline from 28 February to 16 March, owing to logistical problems. \n\nIn April, a report was released by the National People's Assembly, which exonerated Man\u00e9 on charges of trafficking arms to the Casamance rebels. Although the report, which had been due for release in June 1998 when hostilities began, called for the reinstatement of Man\u00e9 as Chief of Staff of the armed forces, it revealed that President Vieira's presidential guard had been heavily implicated in arms trafficking. The [[United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau]] was subsequently established to monitor the general elections and the implementation of the Abuja Agreement.\n\n===Second coup (May 1999)===\n[[File:Bissau former pres palace.jpg|thumb|300px|The war damaged and abandoned former presidential palace in the capital [[Bissau]].]]\n\nIn early May 1999, Vieira announced that legislative and presidential elections would take place on 28 December, but he was overthrown by the rebel [[military junta]] on 7 May, to widespread condemnation by the international community. Fighting had erupted in Bissau on the previous day when rebel troops seized stockpiles of weapons that had been held at the international airport since the disarmament of the rival forces in March. \n\nThe rebels, who claimed that their actions had been prompted by Vieira's refusal to allow his presidential guard to be disarmed, surrounded the presidential palace and forced its surrender. Vieira subsequently took refuge at the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] embassy, where on 10 May 1999 he signed an unconditional surrender.\n\n==Post-conflict events==\nThe President of the [[National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau|National People's Assembly]], [[Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1]], was appointed acting president of the republic until elections were held. The Government of National Unity, including the ministers appointed by Vieira, remained in office. At a meeting of the ruling bodies of the PAIGC that month, [[Manuel Saturnino da Costa]] was appointed to replace Vieira as party leader. \n\nAt a tripartite meeting conducted in late May by representatives of the government, the military junta and the political parties, agreement was reached that Vieira should stand trial for his involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists and for political and economic crimes relating to his terms in office. Vieira subsequently agreed to stand trial, but only after receiving medical treatment abroad, after which he pledged to return to Guinea-Bissau. \n\nAt a meeting of ECOWAS foreign ministers held in Togo in May 1999, Vieira's overthrow was condemned and demands were made for him to be permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau. It was also decided that ECOMOG forces would be withdrawn from the country. The last ECOMOG troops left in early June. \n\nThat month Vieira was permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau to seek medical treatment in France. Sanh\u00e1 cited humanitarian reasons for allowing Vieira's departure, but stressed that he would return to stand trial. In the same month Sanh\u00e1 asserted that presidential and legislative elections would take place by 28 November. In July, [[constitutional amendment]]s were introduced that limited the tenure of presidential office to two terms and abolished the [[death penalty]]. It was also stipulated that the country's principal offices of state could only be held by Guinea-Bissau nationals born of Guinea-Bissau parents.\n\nOn 28 November 1999, [[Elections in Guinea-Bissau|presidential and legislative elections]] were held with the opposition [[Social Renewal Party (Guinea-Bissau)|Social Renewal Party]] (PRS) winning 38 of 102 seats making it the largest party represented in the National People's Assembly. The long ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) won 24 seats. The PRS presidential candidate, [[Kumba Ial\u00e1]], placed first winning 38.81% of the vote. In a run-off held on 16 January 2000, Ial\u00e1 easily defeated acting President Malam Bacai Sanh\u00e1 of the PAIGC, winning 72% of the vote. He was sworn in on 17 February 2000.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n|last=Minahan\n|first=James \n|title= Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World\n|year=2002\n|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]\n|isbn=\n|url=\n|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Guinea-Bissau topics}}\n{{Years in Guinea-Bissau}}\n{{Post-Cold War African conflicts}}\n\n[[Category:History of Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of Africa]]\n[[Category:Civil wars post-1945]]\n[[Category:Separatist rebellion-based civil wars]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Guinea]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Senegal]]\n[[Category:1998 in Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:1999 in Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Proxy wars]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: viwed \u2192 viewed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea-Bissau_Civil_War"}
