The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name=\"pmid8144521\">{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |journal=J.

UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name=\"pmid8144521\">{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |journal=J.

UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

The mother is able to regurgitate small portions of food for her growing [[offspring]], but between 1\u20132 weeks after hatching the progeny capitalize on this food source by eating her alive. Typically, offspring only feed on their biological mother as opposed to other females in the population. In other arachnid species, matriphagy occurs after the ingestion of nutritional eggs known as [[trophic egg]]s (e.g. Black lace-weaver ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'', Crab spider ''[[Australomisidia]] ergandros'') and involves different techniques for killing the mother, such as transfer of poison via biting and sucking to cause a quick death (e.g. Black lace-weaver) or continuous sucking of the [[hemolymph]], resulting in a more gradual death (e.g. Crab spider'').'' The behavior is less well described but follows a similar pattern in species such as the Hump [[earwig]], [[pseudoscorpion]]s, and [[caecilian]]s.\n\nSpiders that engage in matriphagy produce offspring with higher weights, shorter and earlier [[moulting]] time, larger body mass at [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], and higher survival rates than [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] deprived of matriphagy. In some species, matriphagous offspring were also more successful at capturing large prey items and had a higher survival rate at dispersal. These benefits to offspring outweigh the cost of survival to the mothers and help ensure that her genetic material is passed to the next generation, thus perpetuating the behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toyama|first=Masatoshi|date=2003|title=Relationship between reproductive resource allocation and resource capacity in the matriphagous spider, Chiracanthium japonicum (Araneae: Clubionidae)|journal=Journal of Ethology|volume=21|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1007/s10164-002-0067-6}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Mor|last2=Schneider|first2=Jutta|last3=Lubin|first3=Yael|date=2005-2006|title=Maternal investment in a spider with suicidal maternal care, Stegodyphus lineatus (Araneae, Eresidae)|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=109|issue=3|pages=614\u2013622|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13004.x|issn=0030-1299}}</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Toyama|first=Masatoshi|date= March 1999|title=Adaptive advantages of maternal care and matriphagy in a foliage spider,Chiracanthium japonicum (Araneae: Coubionidae)|journal=Journal of Ethology|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33\u201339|doi=10.1007/bf02769295|issn=0289-0771}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Theodore A.|last2=Wallis|first2=Elycia J.|last3=Elgar|first3=Mark A.|date= July 1995|title=Making a meal of mother|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=376|issue=6538|pages=299\u2013300; author reply 301|doi=10.1038/376299a0|pmid=7630393|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>\n\nOverall, matriphagy is an extreme form of [[parental care]] but is highly related to extended care in the Funnel-web spider, parental investment in caecilians, and gerontophagy in social spiders.

Their mother does this by regurgitating her bodily fluids, which contain a mixture of nutrients for them to feed on.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThis behavior begins during mating. Mating causes an increase in the mother's production of digestive enzymes to better digest her prey. Consequently, she is able to retain more nutrients for her offspring to consume later. The mother's [[Midgut|midgut tissues]] start to slowly degrade during the incubation period of her eggs. After her offspring hatch, she regurgitates food for them to feed on with the help of her already-liquefied midgut tissues. Meanwhile, her midgut tissues continue to degrade into a liquid state to maximize the amount of nutrients from the mother's body that her offspring will be able to obtain. As degradation continues, [[Vacuole|nutritional vacuoles]] form within her abdomen to amass all of the nutrients. Consumption begins when her offspring puncture her abdomen to suck up the nutritional vacuoles. After approximately 2\u20133 hours, the mother's bodily fluids are completely consumed, and only her exoskeleton remains.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nThis species is only able to have one clutch, which might explain why so much time and energy is spent on taking care of offspring.

Additionally, body mass tends to be higher for spiderlings that engage in matriphagy as compared to those that do not.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagy advances [[Moulting|molting]] time. Molting is the growing of a larger [[exoskeleton]] and shedding the old one. Advancement of molting time means that the spiders are able to grow at a faster rate.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagous spiderlings tend to experience significantly greater survival rates and fitness compared to non-matriphagous offspring at dispersal.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n* Matriphagous spiderlings hunt larger [[prey]] and show much more complete prey consumption than non-matriphagous spiderlings.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagy improves [[sociality]] in spiders, primarily by reducing sibling [[cannibalism]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Costs to the mother===\nUnlike other milder forms of parental care, matriphagy ends with the life of the mother, the gravest of all costs. So, why has it evolved? In order to answer this, it is important to look at costs to the mother in terms of reproductive output, [[egg sac]] development, and number of young reared (i.e. are offspring more successful if the mother evades matriphagy and reproduces again or if she engages in matriphagy and produces only one clutch?).\n\n* In the Black lace-weaver, ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'' around 80% of females separated prior to matriphagy produce second egg sacs and only approximately 40% of these develop completely (compared to the >90% development of egg sacs in the first brood).<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Additionally, number of spiderlings in the second brood tend to be significantly lower than in the first brood. These individuals are also smaller than the spiders in the first brood.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Females that successively lay two egg sacs have a lower expected output of dispersing offspring than females that are victims of matriphagy and produce only a single clutch.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Summary===\nIn conclusion, offspring that engage in matriphagy benefit more than those that do not engage in this behavior. Furthermore, the progeny of females that escape matriphagy to lay a second brood are significantly less successful than those that ate their mother. Hence, enhanced fitness of the mother accounts for the evolution of this unusual and extreme form of parenting.\n\n== Forms of parental care similar to matriphagy  ==\nMatriphagy is one of the most extreme forms of [[parental care]] observed in the animal kingdom. However, in some species such as the Funnel-web spider ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'', matriphagy is only observed under certain conditions and extended maternal protection is the main method by which offspring receive care. In other organisms such as the African social velvet spider, ''[[Stegodyphus]] mimosarum'' and [[Caecilian]] amphibians, parental behavior closely related in form and function to matriphagy is used.\n\n=== Extended care in a Funnel-web spider: ''Coelotes'' ''terrestris''===\nThe \u2018maternal social\u2019 spider, ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'' (Funnel-web spider) uses extended maternal care as a reproductive model for its offspring. Upon laying the [[egg sac]], a C. terrestris mother stands guard and incubates the sac for 3 to 4 weeks. She stays with her young from the time of their emergence until dispersal approximately 5 to 6 weeks later. During the offsprings\u2019 development, mothers will provide the spiderlings prey based on their levels of gregariousness.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Gundermann|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Horel|first2=Andr\u00e9|last3=Roland|first3=Chantal|date=2010-04-26|title=Costs and Benefits of Maternal Care in a Subsocial Spider, Coelotes terrestris|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=103|issue=11|pages=915\u2013925|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1997.tb00133.x|issn=0179-1613}}</ref>\n[[File:Coelotes_terrestris.jpg|thumb|Image of a Funnel-web spider (''Coelotes terrestris'')]]\nProtecting the egg sacs from [[predation]] and parasites yields a high benefit to cost ratio for the mothers. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of the mother is highly correlated to offspring developmental state\u2014a mother in better condition yields larger young that are better at surviving predation. The presence of the mother also protects the offspring against [[parasitism]]. In addition, the mother can keep feeding while guarding her [[Offspring|progeny]] without any weight loss, allowing her to collect sufficient food for both herself and her offspring.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nOverall, costs of protecting the egg sac are low. Upon separation from egg sacs, 90% of females have the energy sustenance to lay new sacs, although it does induce a time loss of several weeks that could potentially affect reproductive success.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIn experimental conditions, costs arose if maternal care was not provided, with egg sacs drying out and developing [[mold]]s, thus illustrating that maternal care is essential for survival. Experimental food-deprived broods reared by the mother induced matriphagy, where 77% of offspring consumed their mother upon birth. This suggests that matriphagy can exist under nutrient-limited conditions, but the costs generally outweigh the benefits when mothers have sufficient access to resources.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Parental investment by skin-feeding in Caecilian amphibians ===\n[[Caecilian]] amphibians are worm-like in appearance, and mothers have thick [[Epithelium|epithelial]] skin layers. The skin on a caecilian mother is used for a form of parent-offspring nutrient transfer. \n[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|The ringed caecilian is an example of an oviparous caecilian that exhibits parental investment through skin-feeding of the oviduct lining.]]\nThe Taita African caecilian ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]'' is an [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) caecilian whose skin transforms in brooding females to supply nutrients to growing offspring. The offspring are born with specific [[dentition]] that they can use to peel and eat the outer [[Epidermis|epidermal]] later of their mother's skin. Young move around their mother's bodies, using their lower jaws to lift and peel the mother's skin while vigorously pressing their heads against her [[abdomen]]. To account for this, the epidermis of brooding females can be up to twice the thickness of non-brooding females.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kupfer|first=Alexander|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Hendrik|last3=Antoniazzi|first3=Marta M.|last4=Jared|first4=Carlos|last5=Greven|first5=Hartmut|last6=Nussbaum|first6=Ronald A.|last7=Wilkinson|first7=Mark|date=2006|title=Parental investment by skin feeding in a caecilian amphibian|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=440|issue=7086|pages=926\u2013929|doi=10.1038/nature04403|pmid=16612382|issn=0028-0836|hdl=2027.42/62957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62957/1/nature04403.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Viviparity|Viviparous]] (developing in the mother) caecilians on the other hand, have specialized fetal dentition which can be used for scraping [[lipid]]-rich secretions and cellular materials from the maternal [[oviduct]] lining.

Mothers have paler skin tones than non-attending females, suggesting that offspring feed on [[gland]]ular secretions on the mother's skin\u2014a process that resembles mammalian [[lactation]]. This scraping method is different from the peeling actions performed by oviparous caecilians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor both oviparous and viviparous caecilians, delayed investment is a common benefit.

In these specific spiders, deceased females are often found shriveled with shrunken abdomens. Offspring suck nutrients primarily from the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] part of the adult female's abdomen, and she may still be alive during this process.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|date=1987-12-01|title=Gerontophagy versus cannibalism in the social spiders Stegodyphus mimosarum Pavesi and Stegodyphus dumicola Pocock|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1903\u20131905|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(87)80087-8|issn=0003-3472|last1=Seibt|first1=Uta|last2=Wickler|first2=Wolfgang}}</ref>\n\nThis behavior is not quite the same as matriphagy because ''Stegodyphus'' spiderlings are perfectly tolerant to other offspring, healthy [[conspecifics]], and members of other species, suggesting that ordinary cannibalism is suppressed. Instead, the parental care exhibited is known as \"gerontophagy\", or the \u201cconsumption of old individuals\u201d (geron = old person, phagy = to feed on). Gerontophagy is the final act of care for the offspring, and some offspring are found larger than others. This implies that some young spiders are already able to feed on prey by themselves and gerontophagy as a source of nutrition is supplemental rather than necessary. Thus, there exists the \u2018cannibal's kin-dilemma\u2019, which reveals a form of [[kin selection]] in social spiders. In this scenario, kin selection should counteract cannibalism of related individuals in social spiders, but any designated victim should prefer to be eaten by available close relatives.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Cultural significance  ==\n[[File:Become a certified professional with free online classes.jpg|thumb|The rise of online education as an alternative to costly traditional college options can be compared to matriphagy as a survival mechanism.]]\nAlthough matriphagy is not a widely circulated term in society, there are specific instances where it has been used to represent or symbolize specific ideas. For instance, Dr. Luke Winslow from San Diego State University dubbed the concept \"rhetorical matriphagy\" in 2017 in connection with critiques of increasing online [[higher education]] offerings.<ref name=\":C1\">{{cite journal |last1=Winslow |first1=Luke |title=Rhetorical Matriphagy and the Online Commodification of Higher Education |journal=Western Journal of Communication |date=28 Apr 2017 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=582\u2013600 |doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1316418}}</ref> In this analogy, higher education assumes the role of the mother, [[neoliberalism]] assumes the role of the hatchlings, and online education discourse assumes the role of the mother's symbolic resources, which are used to attract hatchings and eventually lead them to engage in matriphagy for these resources.<ref name=\":C1\" /> The theory behind the existence of matriphagy is similar to that of higher education. Matriphagy is a less than ideal [[survival mechanism]] in response to an environment with poor conditions and few natural resources, but it persists because of guaranteed survival of the mother's [[gene]]s via her hatchlings.<ref name=\":C1\" /> Similarly, online education does not consider itself at the same level as traditional forms of higher education but does provide an [[equal opportunity]] for all to attain such education in a cost-effective way that satisfies most stakeholders in the process.<ref name=\":C1\" />\n\nThose who have been exposed to matriphagy may be frightened by such a seemingly strange and bizarre natural behavior, especially since it is mainly observed in already feared organisms. Thus, matriphagy is often posed as perpetuation of a long held fear of [[arachnid]]s in human society.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barness |first1=Sarah |title=Spider Babies Eat Their Mother From The Inside Out, Giving Us Another Reason To Be Terrified Of Arachnids |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/01/spiders-eat-mom_n_4703235.html |agency=HuffPost |date=2 Jan 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, others may look to matriphagy as a leading example of purity, as it represents an instinctive form of [[altruism]].

The mother is able to regurgitate small portions of food for her growing [[offspring]], but between 1-2 weeks after hatching the progeny capitalize on this food source by eating her alive. Typically, offspring only feed on their biological mother as opposed to other females in the population. In other arachnid species, matriphagy occurs after the ingestion of nutritional eggs known as [[Trophic egg|trophic eggs]] (e.g. Black lace-weaver ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'', Crab spider ''[[Australomisidia]] ergandros'') and involves different techniques for killing the mother, such as transfer of poison via biting and sucking to cause a quick death (e.g. Black lace-weaver) or continuous sucking of the [[hemolymph]], resulting in a more gradual death (e.g. Crab spider'').'' The behavior is less well described but follows a similar pattern in species such as the Hump [[earwig]], [[Pseudoscorpion|pseudoscorpions]], and [[Caecilian|caecilians]].\n\nSpiders that engage in matriphagy produce offspring with higher weights, shorter and earlier [[moulting]] time, larger body mass at [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], and higher survival rates than [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] deprived of matriphagy. In some species, matriphagous offspring were also more successful at capturing large prey items and had a higher survival rate at dispersal.

Their mother does this by regurgitating her bodily fluids, which contain a mixture of nutrients for them to feed on.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> \n\nThis behavior begins during mating. Mating causes an increase in the mother's production of digestive enzymes to better digest her prey. Consequently, she is able to retain more nutrients for her offspring to consume later. The mother's [[Midgut|midgut tissues]] start to slowly degrade during the incubation period of her eggs. After her offspring hatch, she regurgitates food for them to feed on with the help of her already-liquefied midgut tissues. Meanwhile, her midgut tissues continue to degrade into a liquid state to maximize the amount of nutrients from the mother's body that her offspring will be able to obtain. As degradation continues, [[Vacuole|nutritional vacuoles]] form within her abdomen to amass all of the nutrients. Consumption begins when her offspring puncture her abdomen to suck up the nutritional vacuoles. After approximately 2-3 hours, the mother's bodily fluids are completely consumed, and only her exoskeleton remains.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nThis species is only able to have one clutch, which might explain why so much time and energy is spent on taking care of offspring.

In [[Viviparity|viviparous]] caecilians, the young consume the mother's [[oviduct]] lining by scraping it off with their teeth. In at least two species, ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]'' and ''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'', the young feed on the mother's skin by tearing it off with their teeth. The consumed skin then regenerates within a few days.<ref name=\"kupfer1\"/> Because neither are closely related, either this behaviour is more common than currently observed or it evolved independently.<ref>Mark Wilkinson; et al.

Additionally, body mass tends to be higher for spiderlings that engage in matriphagy as compared to those that do not.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagy advances [[Moulting|molting]] time. Molting is the growing of a larger [[exoskeleton]] and shedding the old one. Advancement of molting time means that the spiders are able to grow at a faster rate.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagous spiderlings tend to experience significantly greater survival rates and fitness compared to non-matriphagous offspring at dispersal.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n* Matriphagous spiderlings hunt larger [[prey]] and show much more complete prey consumption than non-matriphagous spiderlings.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Matriphagy improves [[sociality]] in spiders, primarily by reducing sibling [[cannibalism]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Costs to the mother===\nUnlike other milder forms of parental care, matriphagy ends with the life of the mother, the gravest of all costs. So, why has it evolved? In order to answer this, it is important to look at costs to the mother in terms of reproductive output, [[egg sac]] development, and number of young reared (i.e. are offspring more successful if the mother evades matriphagy and reproduces again or if she engages in matriphagy and produces only one clutch?). \n\n* In the Black lace-weaver, ''[[Amaurobius ferox]]'' around 80% of females separated prior to matriphagy produce second egg sacs and only approximately 40% of these develop completely (compared to the >90% development of egg sacs in the first brood).<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Additionally, number of spiderlings in the second brood tend to be significantly lower than in the first brood. These individuals are also smaller than the spiders in the first brood.<ref name=\":5\" />\n* Females that successively lay two egg sacs have a lower expected output of dispersing offspring than females that are victims of matriphagy and produce only a single clutch.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Summary===\nIn conclusion, offspring that engage in matriphagy benefit more than those that do not engage in this behavior. Furthermore, the progeny of females that escape matriphagy to lay a second brood are significantly less successful than those that ate their mother. Hence, enhanced fitness of the mother accounts for the evolution of this unusual and extreme form of parenting. \n\n== Forms of parental care similar to matriphagy  ==\nMatriphagy is one of the most extreme forms of [[parental care]] observed in the animal kingdom. However, in some species such as the Funnel-web spider ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'', matriphagy is only observed under certain conditions and extended maternal protection is the main method by which offspring receive care. In other organisms such as the African social velvet spider, ''[[Stegodyphus]] mimosarum'' and [[Caecilian]] amphibians, parental behavior closely related in form and function to matriphagy is used.  \n\n=== Extended care in a Funnel-web spider: ''Coelotes'' ''terrestris''===\nThe \u2018maternal social\u2019 spider, ''[[Coelotes|Coelotes terrestris]]'' (Funnel-web spider) uses extended maternal care as a reproductive model for its offspring. Upon laying the [[egg sac]], a C. terrestris mother stands guard and incubates the sac for 3 to 4 weeks. She stays with her young from the time of their emergence until dispersal approximately 5 to 6 weeks later. During the offsprings\u2019 development, mothers will provide the spiderlings prey based on their levels of gregariousness.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Gundermann|first=Jean-Luc|last2=Horel|first2=Andr\u00e9|last3=Roland|first3=Chantal|date=2010-04-26|title=Costs and Benefits of Maternal Care in a Subsocial Spider, Coelotes terrestris|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=103|issue=11|pages=915\u2013925|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1997.tb00133.x|issn=0179-1613}}</ref>\n[[File:Coelotes_terrestris.jpg|thumb|Image of a Funnel-web spider (''Coelotes terrestris'')]]\nProtecting the egg sacs from [[predation]] and parasites yields a high benefit to cost ratio for the mothers. [[Fitness (biology)|Fitness]] of the mother is highly correlated to offspring developmental state\u2014a mother in better condition yields larger young that are better at surviving predation. The presence of the mother also protects the offspring against [[parasitism]]. In addition, the mother can keep feeding while guarding her [[Offspring|progeny]] without any weight loss, allowing her to collect sufficient food for both herself and her offspring.<ref name=\":17\" /> \n\nOverall, costs of protecting the egg sac are low. Upon separation from egg sacs, 90% of females have the energy sustenance to lay new sacs, although it does induce a time loss of several weeks that could potentially affect reproductive success.<ref name=\":17\" /> \n\nIn experimental conditions, costs arose if maternal care was not provided, with egg sacs drying out and developing [[Mold|molds]], thus illustrating that maternal care is essential for survival. Experimental food-deprived broods reared by the mother induced matriphagy, where 77% of offspring consumed their mother upon birth. This suggests that matriphagy can exist under nutrient-limited conditions, but the costs generally outweigh the benefits when mothers have sufficient access to resources.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Parental investment by skin-feeding in Caecilian amphibians ===\n[[Caecilian]] amphibians are worm-like in appearance, and mothers have thick [[Epithelium|epithelial]] skin layers. The skin on a caecilian mother is used for a form of parent-offspring nutrient transfer. \n[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|The ringed caecilian is an example of an oviparous caecilian that exhibits parental investment through skin-feeding of the oviduct lining.]]\nThe Taita African caecilian ''[[Boulengerula taitana]]'' is an [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) caecilian whose skin transforms in brooding females to supply nutrients to growing offspring. The offspring are born with specific [[dentition]] that they can use to peel and eat the outer [[Epidermis|epidermal]] later of their mother's skin. Young move around their mother's bodies, using their lower jaws to lift and peel the mother's skin while vigorously pressing their heads against her [[abdomen]]. To account for this, the epidermis of brooding females can be up to twice the thickness of non-brooding females.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kupfer|first=Alexander|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Hendrik|last3=Antoniazzi|first3=Marta M.|last4=Jared|first4=Carlos|last5=Greven|first5=Hartmut|last6=Nussbaum|first6=Ronald A.|last7=Wilkinson|first7=Mark|date=2006|title=Parental investment by skin feeding in a caecilian amphibian|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=440|issue=7086|pages=926\u2013929|doi=10.1038/nature04403|pmid=16612382|issn=0028-0836|hdl=2027.42/62957|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62957/1/nature04403.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Viviparity|Viviparous]] (developing in the mother) caecilians on the other hand, have specialized fetal dentition which can be used for scraping [[lipid]]-rich secretions and cellular materials from the maternal [[oviduct]] lining. The ringed caecilian ''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'', an oviparous caecilian, exhibits characteristics similar to viviparous caecilians. Mothers have paler skin tones than non-attending females, suggesting that offspring feed on [[Gland|glandular]] secretions on the mother's skin\u2014a process that resembles mammalian [[lactation]]. This scraping method is different from the peeling actions performed by oviparous caecilians.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nFor both oviparous and viviparous caecilians, delayed investment is a common benefit. Providing nutrition through the skin allows for redirection of nutrients, yielding fewer and larger offspring than caecilians who only provide their offspring with [[Yolk sac|yolk]] nutrients.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rather than the mother sacrificing herself and solely being used for the offspring's nutrition, caecilian mothers supplement their offspring's growth; they provide enough nutrients for the offspring to survive, but not at the cost of their own life. \n\n=== Gerontophagy in social spiders, Genus ''Stegodyphus''===\n[[File:Colonial_Spiders_(Stegodyphus_dumicola)_(6607372243).jpg|thumb|An example of social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) that have been found to participate in gerontophagy as a form of parental care. |240x240px]]\n''[[Stegodyphus]]'' mothers [[Liquefaction|liquefy]] their inner [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] and maternal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] into food deposits. The African social velvet spider ''Stegodyphus mimosarum'' and the African social spider ''Stegodyphus dumicola'' are two social spider species that eat their mothers and other adult females, which is unique since social spiders do not tend to exhibit [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] life history traits. In these specific spiders, deceased females are often found shriveled with shrunken abdomens. Offspring suck nutrients primarily from the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] part of the adult female's abdomen, and she may still be alive during this process.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|date=1987-12-01|title=Gerontophagy versus cannibalism in the social spiders Stegodyphus mimosarum Pavesi and Stegodyphus dumicola Pocock|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1903\u20131905|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(87)80087-8|issn=0003-3472|last1=Seibt|first1=Uta|last2=Wickler|first2=Wolfgang}}</ref>\n\nThis behavior is not quite the same as matriphagy because ''Stegodyphus'' spiderlings are perfectly tolerant to other offspring, healthy [[conspecifics]], and members of other species, suggesting that ordinary cannibalism is suppressed. Instead, the parental care exhibited is known as \"gerontophagy\", or the \u201cconsumption of old individuals\u201d (geron = old person, phagy = to feed on). Gerontophagy is the final act of care for the offspring, and some offspring are found larger than others. This implies that some young spiders are already able to feed on prey by themselves and gerontophagy as a source of nutrition is supplemental rather than necessary. Thus, there exists the \u2018cannibal's kin-dilemma\u2019, which reveals a form of [[kin selection]] in social spiders. In this scenario, kin selection should counteract cannibalism of related individuals in social spiders, but any designated victim should prefer to be eaten by available close relatives.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Cultural significance  ==\n[[File:Become a certified professional with free online classes.jpg|thumb|The rise of online education as an alternative to costly traditional college options can be compared to matriphagy as a survival mechanism.]]\nAlthough matriphagy is not a widely circulated term in society, there are specific instances where it has been used to represent or symbolize specific ideas. For instance, Dr. Luke Winslow from San Diego State University dubbed the concept \"rhetorical matriphagy\" in 2017 in connection with critiques of increasing online [[higher education]] offerings.<ref name=\":C1\">{{cite journal |last1=Winslow |first1=Luke |title=Rhetorical Matriphagy and the Online Commodification of Higher Education |journal=Western Journal of Communication |date=28 Apr 2017 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=582\u2013600 |doi=10.1080/10570314.2017.1316418}}</ref> In this analogy, higher education assumes the role of the mother, [[neoliberalism]] assumes the role of the hatchlings, and online education discourse assumes the role of the mother's symbolic resources, which are used to attract hatchings and eventually lead them to engage in matriphagy for these resources.<ref name=\":C1\" /> The theory behind the existence of matriphagy is similar to that of higher education. Matriphagy is a less than ideal [[survival mechanism]] in response to an environment with poor conditions and few natural resources, but it persists because of guaranteed survival of the mother's [[Gene|genes]] via her hatchlings.<ref name=\":C1\" /> Similarly, online education does not consider itself at the same level as traditional forms of higher education but does provide an [[equal opportunity]] for all to attain such education in a cost-effective way that satisfies most stakeholders in the process.<ref name=\":C1\" />\n\nThose who have been exposed to matriphagy may be frightened by such a seemingly strange and bizarre natural behavior, especially since it is mainly observed in already feared organisms. Thus, matriphagy is often posed as perpetuation of a long held fear of [[arachnid]]s in human society.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barness |first1=Sarah |title=Spider Babies Eat Their Mother From The Inside Out, Giving Us Another Reason To Be Terrified Of Arachnids |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/01/spiders-eat-mom_n_4703235.html |agency=HuffPost |date=2 Jan 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, others may look to matriphagy as a leading example of purity, as it represents an instinctive form of [[altruism]]. Altruism in this case refers to an \"intentional action ultimately for the welfare of others that entails at least the possibility of either no benefit or a loss to the actor,\" and is a highly popularized and desirable concept in many human cultures.<ref name=\":C2\">{{cite journal |last1=Montayne |first1=James A. |title=Review of 'Does Altruism Exist?

Seacole later expressed exasperation at their feeble resistance, claiming they \"bowed down before the plague in slavish despair\".<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> She performed an [[autopsy]] on an orphan child for whom she had cared, which gave her \"decidedly useful\" new knowledge. At the end of this epidemic she herself contracted cholera, forcing her to rest for several weeks. In her autobiography, ''The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands'', she describes how the residents of Cruces responded: \"When it became known that their \"yellow doctress\" had the cholera, I must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave me plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for me more actively, had there been any occasion.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands|last=Seacole|first=Mary|publisher=James Blackwood|year=1857|isbn=|location=London|pages=Chapter V}}</ref>\n\nCholera was to return again: [[Ulysses S. Grant]] passed through Cruces in July, 1852, on military duty; a hundred and twenty men, a third of his party, died of the disease there or shortly afterwards en route to Panama City.<ref name=\"robinson54\">Robinson, p. 54.</ref>\n\nDespite the problems of disease and climate, Panama remained the favoured route between the coasts of the United States. Seeing a business opportunity, Seacole opened the British Hotel, which was a restaurant rather than an hotel. She described it as a \"tumble down hut,\" with two rooms, the smaller one to be her bedroom, the larger one to serve up to 50 diners. She soon added the services of a barber.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs the wet season ended in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up to move to Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that \"God bless the best yaller woman he ever made\" and asked the listeners to join with him in rejoicing that \"she's so many shades removed from being entirely black\". He went on to say that \"if we could bleach her by any means we would&nbsp;[...] and thus make her acceptable in any company[,] as she deserves to be\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\">Seacole, Chapter VI.</ref> Seacole replied firmly that she did not \"appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value.\" She declined the offer of \"bleaching\" and drank \"to you and the general reformation of American manners\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> Salih notes Seacole's use here of eye dialect, set against her own English, as an implicit inversion of the day's caricatures of \"black talk\".<ref>Salih, p. xxvi.</ref> Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices,<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> commenting that \"it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men\".<ref name=\"SeacoleV\">Seacole, Chapter V.</ref> She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nIn Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a females-only hotel. In late 1852, she travelled home to Jamaica. Already delayed, the journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an American ship. She was forced to wait for a later British boat.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />  She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, \"I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at [[Up-Park Camp]],\" she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6&nbsp;km, from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]), \"and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nSeacole returned to Panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs, and three months later moved to the New Granada Mining Gold Company establishment at Fort Bowen Mine some {{convert|70|mi|km}} away near Escribanos.<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\">Seacole, Chapter VII.</ref> The superintendent, Thomas Day, was related to her late husband. Seacole had read newspaper reports of the outbreak of war against Russia before she left Jamaica, and news of the escalating [[Crimean War]] reached her in Panama. She determined to travel to England to volunteer as a nurse,<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\" /> to experience the \"pomp, pride and circumstance of glorious war\" as she described it in Chapter I of her autobiography. A part of her reasoning for going to the Crimean was that she knew some of the soldiers that were deployed there. In her autobiography she explains how she heard of soldiers that she had cared for in the 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to England in preparation for the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n== Crimean War, 1853\u201356 ==\n[[File:Seacole simpson sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of Mary Seacole by Crimean [[war artist]] [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] (1823\u20131899), c.&nbsp;1855]]\nThe [[Crimean War]] lasted from October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the [[Russian Empire]] and an alliance of the United Kingdom, [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the conflict took place on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]] in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Turkey]].\n\nMany thousands of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from Cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better when they arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 October triggered [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], [[Secretary of State for War]], to approach [[Florence Nightingale]] to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.<ref>Robinson, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nSeacole travelled from Navy Bay in Panama to England, initially to deal with her investments in gold-mining businesses. She then attempted to join the second contingent of nurses to the Crimea. She applied to the War Office and other government offices, but arrangements for departure were already underway. In her memoir, she wrote that she brought \"ample testimony\" of her experience in nursing, but the only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of the West Granada Gold-Mining Company. However, Seacole wrote that this was just one of the testimonials she had in her possession.<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\">Seacole, Chapter VIII.</ref>  Seacole wrote in her autobiography, \"Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the Crimea and nurse her \"sons\" there, suffering from cholera, diarrh\u0153a, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural enough \u2013 although I had references, and other voices spoke for me \u2013 that they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer.\"<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81.</ref>\n\nSeacole also applied to the Crimean Fund, a fund raised by public subscription to support the wounded in Crimea, for sponsorship to travel there, but she again met with refusal.<ref>Robinson, p. 90.</ref> Seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down. She wrote in her autobiography, \"Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had some root here?

[[Business card]]s were printed and sent ahead to announce her intention to open an establishment, to be called the \"British Hotel\", near Balaclava, which would be \"a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /> Shortly afterwards, her Caribbean acquaintance, Thomas Day, arrived unexpectedly in London, and the two formed a partnership. They assembled a stock of supplies, and Seacole embarked on the Dutch screw-steamer ''Hollander'' on 27 January 1855 on its maiden voyage, to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 91.</ref> The ship called at [[Malta]], where Seacole encountered a doctor who had recently left [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]].

Seacole wrote, \"Mrs. B. questions me very kindly, but with the same look of curiosity and surprise. What object has Mrs. Seacole in coming out? This is the purport of her questions.

In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking \"What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref> Seacole told her of her \"dread of the night journey by [[ca\u00efque|caique]]\" and the improbability of being able to find the ''Hollander'' in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a \"kind message\" from Bracebridge. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently \"saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava,\" but no further meetings are recorded in the text.\n\nAfter transferring most of her stores to the transport ship ''Albatross'', with the remainder following on the ''Nonpareil'', she set out on the four-day voyage to the British bridgehead into Crimea at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].<ref name=\"SeacoleX\">Seacole, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nLacking proper building materials, Seacole gathered abandoned metal and wood in her spare moments, with a view to using the debris to build her hotel. She found a site for the hotel at a place she christened Spring Hill, near [[Kadikoi]], some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} along the main British supply road from Balaclava to the British camp near [[Sevastopol]], and within a mile of the British headquarters.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\">Seacole, Chapter XI.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was built from the salvaged driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets, and salvaged architectural items such as glass doors and window-frames, from the village of Kamara, using hired local labour.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\" /> The new British Hotel opened in March 1855. An early visitor was [[Alexis Soyer]], a noted French chef who had travelled to Crimea to help improve the diet of British soldiers. He records meeting Seacole in his 1857 work ''A Culinary Campaign'' and describes Seacole as \"an old dame of a jovial appearance, but a few shades darker than the white lily\".<ref>Quoted by Ramdin, p. 85.</ref> Seacole requested Soyer's advice on how to manage her business, and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service, and not to have beds for visitors because the few either slept on board ships in the harbour or in tents in the camp.<ref name=\"Soyer\">Alexis Soyer, ''Soyer's Culinary Campaign'',(London: G. Routledge, 1857), p. 233.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was completed in July at a total cost of \u00a3800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\">Seacole, Chapter XII.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 111.</ref> The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, as well as local purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby [[Gagarin Raion|Kamiesch]]. Seacole sold anything \u2013 \"from a needle to an anchor\"\u2014to army officers and visiting sightseers.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\" /> Meals were served at the Hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.\n\nDespite constant thefts, particularly of livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of ''Wonderful Adventures'' describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole did some of the cooking herself: \"Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry.\" When called to \"dispense medications,\" she did so.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIV\">Seacole, Chapter XIV.</ref> Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings,<ref name=\"SeacoleXV\">Seacole, Chapter XV.</ref> noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit.<ref name=\"Soyer\" /> \n\nTo Soyer, near the time of departure, Florence Nightingale acknowledged favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks\u2014he knew both women\u2014show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: \"You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.\"<ref>Soyer, p. 434.</ref> When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied \"with a smile: 'I should like to see her before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'\"<ref>Soyer, p. 43.</ref> Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.<ref>Letter, 5 August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/60.</ref>\n\n[[File:SeacoleWar.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map illustrating Mary Seacole's involvement in the Crimean War]]\nSeacole often went out to the troops as a [[sutler]],<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/seacole_mary.shtml|title=Mary Seacole (1805\u20131881)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=c. 2005|accessdate=30 March 2008}}</ref> selling her provisions near the British camp at Kadikoi, and attending to casualties brought out from the trenches around Sevastopol or from the [[Battle of the Chernaya|Tchernaya valley]].<ref name=nuos/> She was widely known to the British Army as \"Mother Seacole\".<ref name=mixedfolks/>\n\nApart from serving officers at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart's Hill, some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVI\">Seacole, Chapter XVI.</ref> In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, [[William Howard Russell]], special correspondent of ''The Times'', wrote that she was a \"warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow's blessing.\" Russell also wrote that she \"redeemed the name of sutler\", and another that she was \"both a Miss Nightingale and a [chef]\". Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing\u2014often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours.<ref>''The Times'', 26 September 1855, p. 6.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 131.</ref> While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had \"...&nbsp;personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay&nbsp;...\".<ref>Lady Alicia Blackwood, ''A Narrative of Personal Experiences and Impressions during a Residence on the Bosphorus throughout the Crimean War'', 1881; quoted in Alexander & Dewjee, p. 28.</ref>\n\nHer peers, though wary at first, soon found out how important Seacole was for both medical assistance and morale. One British medical officers described Seacole in his memoir as \"The acquaintance of a celebrated person, Mrs. Seacole, a coloured women who out of the goodness of her heart and at her own expense, supplied hot tea to the poor sufferers [wounded men being transported from the peninsula to the hospital at Scutari ] while they are waiting to be lifted into the boats\u2026. She did not spare herself if she could do any good to the suffering soldiers. In rain and snow, in storm and tempest, day after day she was at her self-chosen post with her stove and kettle, in any shelter she could find, brewing tea for all who wanted it, and they were many. Sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day, but Mrs. Seacole was always equal, to the occasion\". But Seacole did more than carry tea to the suffering soldiers. She often carried bags of lint, bandages, needles and thread to tend to the wounds of soldiers.<ref name=\"nlj.gov.jm\"/>\n\nIn late August, Seacole was on the route to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, and it was clear that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications to the north of the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole fulfilled a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\">Seacole, Chapter XVII.</ref> Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long painting of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 138.</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Sevastopol, hostilities continued in a desultory fashion.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVIII\">Seacole, Chapter XVIII.</ref> The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days.<ref>Robinson, p. 145.</ref> There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.<ref>Robinson, pp. 146\u201347.</ref>\n\nSeacole was joined by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer described her as \"the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah\", with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel [[Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet|Henry Bunbury]]. However, there is no evidence that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband.<ref>Robinson, p. 155.</ref> Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.<ref>Ramdin, pp. 120\u201323.</ref>\n\nPeace talks began in Paris in early 1856, and friendly relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\">Seacole, Chapter XIX.</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 March 1856, after which the soldiers left Crimea.

Elm House, 25 July 1857, pg. 105.</ref>\n\nSociology professor Lynn McDonald is co-founder of The [[Nightingale Society]], which promotes the legacy of Nightingale, who did not see eye-to-eye with Seacole. McDonald believes that Seacole's role in the Crimean War was overplayed:<ref>TLS, 6 Dec 2013 p.24</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mary Seacole, although never the 'black British nurse' she is claimed to have been, was a successful mixed-race immigrant to Britain.   She led an adventurous life, and her memoir of 1857 is still a lively read.   She was kind and generous.   She made friends of her customers, army and navy officers, who came to her rescue with a fund when she was declared bankrupt.   While her cures have been vastly exaggerated, she doubtless did what she could to ease suffering, when no effective cures existed.   In epidemics pre-Crimea, she said a comforting word to the dying and closed the eyes of the dead.   During the Crimean War, probably her greatest kindness was to serve hot tea and lemonade to cold, suffering soldiers awaiting transport to hospital on the wharf at Balaclava.   She deserves much credit for rising to the occasion, but her tea and lemonade did not save lives, pioneer nursing or advance health care.}}\n\nHowever, historians maintain that claims that Seacole only served \"tea and lemonade\" do a disservice to the tradition of Jamaican \"doctresses\", such as Seacole's mother, [[Cubah Cornwallis]], Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, who cared for Jamaica's wealthiest planter of the 18th century, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)]]. They all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle. Social historian Jane Robinson argues in her book ''Mary Seacole: The Black Woman who invented Modern Nursing'' that Seacole was a huge success, and she became known and loved by everyone from the rank and file to the royal family.<ref>[https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781845294977 ''MARY SEACOLE'' by Jane Robinson] at Little, Brown.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Anwionwu, [http://www.mixedracestudies.org/?tag=mary-jane-grant-seacole \"Scotching Three Myths About Mary Seacole\"], ''British Journal of Healthcare Assistants'', Vol. 7, Issue 10 (October 2013), pp. 508\u2013511.

In the conclusion to her autobiography, she records that she \"took the opportunity\" to visit \"yet other lands\" on her return journey, although Robinson attributes this to her impecunious state requiring a roundabout trip. She arrived in August 1856 and opened a canteen with Day at [[Aldershot]], but the venture failed through lack of funds.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-41194 Mary Jane Seacole - [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] 2006]</ref> She attended a celebratory dinner for 2,000&nbsp;soldiers at [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] in [[Kennington]] on 25 August 1856, at which Nightingale was chief guest of honour. Reports in ''The Times'' on 26 August and ''[[News of the World]]'' on 31 August indicate that Seacole was also f\u00eated by the huge crowds, with two \"burly\" sergeants protecting her from the pressure of the crowd. However, creditors who had supplied her firm in Crimea were in pursuit. She was forced to move to 1, Tavistock Street, [[Covent Garden]] in increasingly dire financial straits. The Bankruptcy Court in [[Basinghall Street]] declared her [[bankrupt]] on 7 November 1856.<ref>Robinson, pp. 157, 160.</ref> Robinson speculates that Seacole's business problems may have been caused in part by her partner, Day, who dabbled in [[horse trading]] and may have set up as an unofficial bank, cashing debts.<ref>Robinson, p. 159.</ref>\n\nAt about this time, Seacole began to wear [[Military orders, awards and decorations|military medals]].

After quoting her letter in full the magazine provides a satiric cartoon of the activity she describes, captioned \"Our Own [[Vivandi\u00e8re]],\" describing Seacole as a female sutler. The article observes, \"It will be evident, from the foregoing, that Mother Seacole has sunk much lower in the world, and is also in danger of rising much higher in it, than is consistent with the honour of the British army, and the generosity of the British public.\" While urging the public to donate, the commentary's tone can be read as ironic: \"Who would give a guinea to see a mimic-sutler woman, and a foreigner, frisk and amble about on the stage, when he might bestow the money on a genuine English one, reduced to a two-pair back, and in imminent danger of being obliged to climb into an attic?\"<ref>\"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re.\" ''Punch''. 30 May 1857, pg. 221.</ref>\n[[File:MarySeacole Punch.jpg|thumb|Mary Seacole, depicted as an admirer of ''Punch'' along with her British Crimean War patients in \"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re\" (''Punch,'' 30 May 1857).]]\nFurther fund-raising and literary mentions kept Seacole in the public eye. In May 1857 she wanted to travel to India, to minister to the wounded of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but she was dissuaded by both the new Secretary of War, [[Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie|Lord Panmure]],<ref>Robinson, p. 179.</ref> and her financial troubles.<ref>Robinson, p. 169.</ref> Fund-raising activities included the \"Seacole Fund Grand Military Festival\", which was held at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]], from Monday 27 July to Thursday 30 July 1857. This successful event was supported by many military men, including [[Major General]] [[Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby|Lord Rokeby]] (who had commanded the 1st Division in Crimea) and Lord [[George Augustus Frederick Paget|George Paget]]; more than 1,000&nbsp;artists performed, including 11&nbsp;military bands and an orchestra conducted by [[Louis Antoine Jullien]], which was attended by a crowd of circa 40,000.<ref>See account in Robinson, pp. 175\u201378.</ref> The one-shilling entrance charge was quintupled for the first night, and halved for the Tuesday performance. However, production costs had been high and the Royal Surrey Gardens Company was itself having financial problems. It became insolvent immediately after the festival, and as a result Seacole only received [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]57, one quarter of the profits from the event.

She was cited as an example of \"hidden\" black history in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988), like [[Olaudah Equiano]]: \"See, here is Mary Seacole, who did as much in the Crimea as another magic-lamping lady, but, being dark, could scarce be seen for the flame of Florence's candle.\"<ref>[[Salman Rushdie]], ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Vintage, p. 292, quoted in Salih, p. xv.</ref>\n\nShe has been better remembered in the Caribbean, where significant buildings were named after her in the 1950s: the headquarters of the Jamaican General Trained Nurses' Association was christened \"Mary Seacole House\" in 1954, followed quickly by the naming of a hall of residence of the [[University of the West Indies]] in [[Mona, Jamaica]],<ref name=\"robinson199\">Robinson, p. 199.</ref> and a ward at Kingston Public Hospital was also named in her memory.<ref>Alexander & Dewjee, p. 40.</ref> More than a century after her death, Seacole was awarded the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] in 1991.\n\nHer grave in London was rediscovered in 1973; a service of reconsecration was held on 20 November 1973, and her impressive gravestone was also restored by the British Commonwealth Nurses' War Memorial Fund and the Lignum Vitae Club. Nonetheless, when scholarly and popular works were written in the 1970s about the [[Black British]] presence, she was absent from the historical record,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Frank|last2=Haikin|first2=Patricia|title=Black Britons|date=1971|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0199130078}}</ref> and went unrecorded by [[Edward Scobie]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scobie|first1=Edward|title=Black Britannia : a history of blacks in Britain|date=1972|publisher=Johnson publ.

According to the writer Helen Rappaport, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the West African and Jamaican creole \"doctress\", such as Cornwallis and Sarah Adams, who both died in the late 1840s, often had greater success than the European-trained doctor who practised what was then traditional medicine. These doctresses of Jamaica practised hygiene long before Nightingale adopted it as one of her key reforms in her book [[Notes on Nursing]] in 1859.

Seacole then worked alongside her mother, occasionally being called to assist at the [[British Army]] hospital at [[Up-Park Camp]]. She also travelled the Caribbean, visiting the British colony of [[New Providence]] in The Bahamas, the Spanish colony of [[Cuba]], and the new republic of [[Haiti]]. Seacole records these travels, but omits mention of significant current events, such as the [[Baptist War|Christmas Rebellion]] in Jamaica of 1831, the partial abolition of slavery in 1834,<ref>Robinson, p. 34.</ref> and the full abolition of slavery in 1838.<ref>Salih, p. xx.</ref>\n\nShe married Edwin Horatio Hamilton Seacole in Kingston on 10 November 1836.<ref>The wedding of Mary and Edwin Seacole is featured in [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1427915/ ''Mother Seacole'']</ref> Her marriage, from betrothal to widowhood, is described in just nine lines at the conclusion of the first chapter of her autobiography.<ref name=\"SeacoleI\" /> Robinson reports the legend in the Seacole family that Edwin was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]] and his mistress, [[Emma,_Lady_Hamilton|Emma Hamilton]], who was adopted by Thomas, a local \"surgeon, apothecary and man midwife\"<ref>Robinson, footnote 1c chapter 6.</ref> (Seacole's will indicates that Horatio Seacole was Nelson's [[Godparent|godson:]]  she left a diamond ring to her friend, [[Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby|Lord Rokeby]], \"given to my late husband by his godfather Viscount Nelson\", but there was no mention of this godson in Nelson's own will or its [[Codicil (will)|codicils]].)<ref>Robinson, footnote 1 to Chapter 6, p. 209.</ref>  Edwin was a merchant and seems to have had a poor constitution. The newly married couple moved to [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]] and opened a provisions store which failed to prosper. They returned to Blundell Hall in the early 1840s.\n\nDuring 1843 and 1844, Seacole suffered a series of personal disasters. She and her family lost much of the [[boarding house]] in a fire in Kingston on 29 August 1843.<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> Blundell Hall burned down, and was replaced by New Blundell Hall, which was described as \"better than before\".<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> Then her husband died in October 1844, followed by her mother.<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> After a period of grief, in which Seacole says she did not stir for days,<ref name=\"SeacoleI\" /> she composed herself, \"turned a bold front to fortune\",<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> and assumed the management of her mother's hotel. She put her rapid recovery down to her hot Creole blood, blunting the \"sharp edge of [her] grief\" sooner than Europeans who she thought \"nurse their woe secretly in their hearts\".<ref name=\"SeacoleI\" /> She absorbed herself in work, declining many offers of marriage.<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> She later became widely known and respected, particularly among the European military visitors to Jamaica who often stayed at Blundell Hall. She treated patients in the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1850, which killed some 32,000&nbsp;Jamaicans.<ref>Robinson, p. 36.</ref> Seacole attributed the outbreak to infection brought on a steamer from [[New Orleans, Louisiana]],<ref name=\"SeacoleII\" /> demonstrating knowledge of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] theory.<ref>Salih, p. xviii; Chapter II, footnote 9, p. 186.</ref> This first-hand experience would benefit her during the next five years.\n\n== In Central America, 1851\u201354 ==\nIn 1850, Seacole's [[half-brother]] Edward <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edward/6000000012999565717|title=Edward Grant|last=|first=|date=|website=Geni|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> moved to Cruces<!--I suspect that Cruces was on the old Camino de Cruces, and is now beneath the Panama Canal. File:National parks of Panama map.png-->, Panama, which was then part of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]]. There, approximately {{convert|45|mi|km}} up the [[Chagres River]] from the coast, he followed the family trade by establishing the Independent Hotel to accommodate the many travellers between the eastern and western coasts of the United States (the number of travellers had increased enormously, as part of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]<ref>Robinson, p. 42.</ref>).

She eschewed [[opium]], preferring [[mustard plant|mustard]] rubs and [[poultice]]s, the [[laxative]] calomel ([[Mercury(I) chloride|mercuric chloride]]), sugars of lead ([[lead(II) acetate]]), and [[Fluid replacement|rehydration]] with water boiled with [[cinnamon]].<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 53.</ref> While her preparations had moderate success, she faced little competition, the only other treatments coming from a \"timid little dentist\",<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> who was an inexperienced doctor sent by the Panamanian government, and the Roman Catholic Church.\n[[File:Blackwood Seacole sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of Mary Seacole's British Hotel in Crimea, by Lady [[Alicia Blackwood]] (1818\u20131913), a friend of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s who resided in the neighbouring \"Zebra Vicarage\"]]\nThe epidemic raged through the population. Seacole later expressed exasperation at their feeble resistance, claiming they \"bowed down before the plague in slavish despair\".<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> She performed an [[autopsy]] on an orphan child for whom she had cared, which gave her \"decidedly useful\" new knowledge. At the end of this epidemic she herself contracted cholera, forcing her to rest for several weeks. In her autobiography, ''The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands'', she describes how the residents of Cruces responded: \"When it became known that their \"yellow doctress\" had the cholera, I must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave me plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for me more actively, had there been any occasion.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands|last=Seacole|first=Mary|publisher=James Blackwood|year=1857|isbn=|location=London|pages=Chapter V}}</ref>\n\nCholera was to return again: [[Ulysses S. Grant]] passed through Cruces in July, 1852, on military duty; a hundred and twenty men, a third of his party, died of the disease there or shortly afterwards en route to Panama City.<ref name=\"robinson54\">Robinson, p. 54.</ref>\n\nDespite the problems of disease and climate, Panama remained the favoured route between the coasts of the United States. Seeing a business opportunity, Seacole opened the British Hotel, which was a restaurant rather than an hotel. She described it as a \"tumble down hut,\" with two rooms, the smaller one to be her bedroom, the larger one to serve up to 50 diners. She soon added the services of a barber.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs the wet season ended in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up to move to Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that \"God bless the best yaller woman he ever made\" and asked the listeners to join with him in rejoicing that \"she's so many shades removed from being entirely black\". He went on to say that \"if we could bleach her by any means we would&nbsp;[...] and thus make her acceptable in any company[,] as she deserves to be\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\">Seacole, Chapter VI.</ref> Seacole replied firmly that she did not \"appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value.\" She declined the offer of \"bleaching\" and drank \"to you and the general reformation of American manners\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> Salih notes Seacole's use here of eye dialect, set against her own English, as an implicit inversion of the day's caricatures of \"black talk\".<ref>Salih, p. xxvi.</ref> Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices,<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> commenting that \"it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men\".<ref name=\"SeacoleV\">Seacole, Chapter V.</ref> She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nIn Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a females-only hotel. In late 1852, she travelled home to Jamaica. Already delayed, the journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an American ship. She was forced to wait for a later British boat.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />  She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, \"I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at [[Up-Park Camp]],\" she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6&nbsp;km, from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]), \"and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nSeacole returned to Panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs, and three months later moved to the New Granada Mining Gold Company establishment at Fort Bowen Mine some {{convert|70|mi|km}} away near Escribanos.<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\">Seacole, Chapter VII.</ref> The superintendent, Thomas Day, was related to her late husband. Seacole had read newspaper reports of the outbreak of war against Russia before she left Jamaica, and news of the escalating [[Crimean War]] reached her in Panama. She determined to travel to England to volunteer as a nurse,<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\" /> to experience the \"pomp, pride and circumstance of glorious war\" as she described it in Chapter I of her autobiography. A part of her reasoning for going to the Crimean was that she knew some of the soldiers that were deployed there. In her autobiography she explains how she heard of soldiers that she had cared for in the 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to England in preparation for the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n== Crimean War, 1853\u201356 ==\n[[File:Seacole simpson sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of Mary Seacole by Crimean [[war artist]] [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] (1823\u20131899), c.&nbsp;1855]]\nThe [[Crimean War]] lasted from October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the [[Russian Empire]] and an alliance of the United Kingdom, [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the conflict took place on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]] in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Turkey]].\n\nMany thousands of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from Cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better when they arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 October triggered [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], [[Secretary of State for War]], to approach [[Florence Nightingale]] to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.<ref>Robinson, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nSeacole travelled from Navy Bay in Panama to England, initially to deal with her investments in gold-mining businesses. She then attempted to join the second contingent of nurses to the Crimea. She applied to the War Office and other government offices, but arrangements for departure were already underway. In her memoir, she wrote that she brought \"ample testimony\" of her experience in nursing, but the only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of the West Granada Gold-Mining Company. However, Seacole wrote that this was just one of the testimonials she had in her possession.<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\">Seacole, Chapter VIII.</ref>  Seacole wrote in her autobiography, \"Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the Crimea and nurse her \"sons\" there, suffering from cholera, diarrh\u0153a, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural enough \u2013 although I had references, and other voices spoke for me \u2013 that they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer.\"<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81.</ref>\n\nSeacole also applied to the Crimean Fund, a fund raised by public subscription to support the wounded in Crimea, for sponsorship to travel there, but she again met with refusal.<ref>Robinson, p. 90.</ref> Seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down. She wrote in her autobiography, \"Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had some root here? Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs?\"<ref name=\"Seacole, pp. 73-81\">Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures'', Chapter VIII, pp. 73-81.</ref><ref>Gretchen Gerzina, ''Black Victorians'' (Rutgers University Press, 2003). p. 74.</ref> An attempt to join the contingent of nurses was also rebuffed, as she wrote, \"Once again I tried, and had an interview this time with one of Miss Nightingale's companions. She gave me the same reply, and I read in her face the fact, that had there been a vacancy, I should not have been chosen to fill it.\"<ref name=\"Seacole, pp. 73-81\"/><ref>Gerzina, ''Black Victorians'', pp. 76-7.</ref> Seacole did not stop after being rebuffed by the Secretary-at-War, she soon approached his wife, Elizabeth Herbert, who also informed her \"that the full complement of nurses had been secured\" (Seacole 78, 79).\n\nNightingale reportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole's advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".<ref>Jan Marsh, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/mary-seacole-by-jane-robinson-748262.html \"Mary Seacole by Jane Robinson\"], ''The Independent'', 21 January 2005.</ref><ref>Tan-Feng Chang, ''Creolizing the White Woman's Burdden: Mary Seacole Playing\"Mother\" at the Colonial Crossroads Between Panama and Crimea'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017, p. 526.</ref>\n\nSeacole finally resolved to travel to Crimea using her own resources and to open the British Hotel. [[Business card]]s were printed and sent ahead to announce her intention to open an establishment, to be called the \"British Hotel\", near Balaclava, which would be \"a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /> Shortly afterwards, her Caribbean acquaintance, Thomas Day, arrived unexpectedly in London, and the two formed a partnership. They assembled a stock of supplies, and Seacole embarked on the Dutch screw-steamer ''Hollander'' on 27 January 1855 on its maiden voyage, to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 91.</ref> The ship called at [[Malta]], where Seacole encountered a doctor who had recently left [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]]. He wrote her a [[letter of introduction]] to Nightingale.<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref>\n\nSeacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, where she asked for a bed for the night. Seacole wrote, \"Mrs. B. questions me very kindly, but with the same look of curiosity and surprise. What object has Mrs. Seacole in coming out? This is the purport of her questions. And I say, frankly, to be of use somewhere; for other considerations I had not, until necessity forced them upon me. Willingly, had they accepted me, I would have worked for the wounded, in return for bread and water. I fancy Mrs. B\u2014 thought that I sought for employment at Scutari, for she said, very kindly \u2013 \"Miss Nightingale has the entire management of our hospital staff, but I do not think that any vacancy \u2013 \"<ref>Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures'', Chapter XI, pp. 82-91.</ref>\n\nSeacole interrupted Bracebridge to inform her that she intended to travel to Balaclava the next day to join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking \"What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref> Seacole told her of her \"dread of the night journey by [[ca\u00efque|caique]]\" and the improbability of being able to find the ''Hollander'' in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a \"kind message\" from Bracebridge. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently \"saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava,\" but no further meetings are recorded in the text.\n\nAfter transferring most of her stores to the transport ship ''Albatross'', with the remainder following on the ''Nonpareil'', she set out on the four-day voyage to the British bridgehead into Crimea at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].<ref name=\"SeacoleX\">Seacole, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nLacking proper building materials, Seacole gathered abandoned metal and wood in her spare moments, with a view to using the debris to build her hotel. She found a site for the hotel at a place she christened Spring Hill, near [[Kadikoi]], some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} along the main British supply road from Balaclava to the British camp near [[Sevastopol]], and within a mile of the British headquarters.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\">Seacole, Chapter XI.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was built from the salvaged driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets, and salvaged architectural items such as glass doors and window-frames, from the village of Kamara, using hired local labour.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\" /> The new British Hotel opened in March 1855. An early visitor was [[Alexis Soyer]], a noted French chef who had travelled to Crimea to help improve the diet of British soldiers. He records meeting Seacole in his 1857 work ''A Culinary Campaign'' and describes Seacole as \"an old dame of a jovial appearance, but a few shades darker than the white lily\".<ref>Quoted by Ramdin, p. 85.</ref> Seacole requested Soyer's advice on how to manage her business, and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service, and not to have beds for visitors because the few either slept on board ships in the harbour or in tents in the camp.<ref name=\"Soyer\">Alexis Soyer, ''Soyer's Culinary Campaign'',(London: G. Routledge, 1857), p. 233.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was completed in July at a total cost of \u00a3800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\">Seacole, Chapter XII.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 111.</ref> The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, as well as local purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby [[Gagarin Raion|Kamiesch]]. Seacole sold anything \u2013 \"from a needle to an anchor\"\u2014to army officers and visiting sightseers.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\" /> Meals were served at the Hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.\n\nDespite constant thefts, particularly of livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of ''Wonderful Adventures'' describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole did some of the cooking herself: \"Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry.\" When called to \"dispense medications,\" she did so.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIV\">Seacole, Chapter XIV.</ref> Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings,<ref name=\"SeacoleXV\">Seacole, Chapter XV.</ref> noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit.<ref name=\"Soyer\" /> \n\nTo Soyer, near the time of departure, Florence Nightingale acknowledged favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks\u2014he knew both women\u2014show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: \"You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.\"<ref>Soyer, p. 434.</ref> When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied \"with a smile: 'I should like to see her before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'\"<ref>Soyer, p. 43.</ref> Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.<ref>Letter, 5 August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/60.</ref>\n\n[[File:SeacoleWar.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map illustrating Mary Seacole's involvement in the Crimean War]]\nSeacole often went out to the troops as a [[sutler]],<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/seacole_mary.shtml|title=Mary Seacole (1805\u20131881)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=c. 2005|accessdate=30 March 2008}}</ref> selling her provisions near the British camp at Kadikoi, and attending to casualties brought out from the trenches around Sevastopol or from the [[Battle of the Chernaya|Tchernaya valley]].<ref name=nuos/> She was widely known to the British Army as \"Mother Seacole\".<ref name=mixedfolks/>\n\nApart from serving officers at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart's Hill, some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVI\">Seacole, Chapter XVI.</ref> In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, [[William Howard Russell]], special correspondent of ''The Times'', wrote that she was a \"warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow's blessing.\" Russell also wrote that she \"redeemed the name of sutler\", and another that she was \"both a Miss Nightingale and a [chef]\". Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing\u2014often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours.<ref>''The Times'', 26 September 1855, p. 6.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 131.</ref> While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had \"...&nbsp;personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay&nbsp;...\".<ref>Lady Alicia Blackwood, ''A Narrative of Personal Experiences and Impressions during a Residence on the Bosphorus throughout the Crimean War'', 1881; quoted in Alexander & Dewjee, p. 28.</ref>\n\nHer peers, though wary at first, soon found out how important Seacole was for both medical assistance and morale. One British medical officers described Seacole in his memoir as \"The acquaintance of a celebrated person, Mrs. Seacole, a coloured women who out of the goodness of her heart and at her own expense, supplied hot tea to the poor sufferers [wounded men being transported from the peninsula to the hospital at Scutari ] while they are waiting to be lifted into the boats\u2026. She did not spare herself if she could do any good to the suffering soldiers. In rain and snow, in storm and tempest, day after day she was at her self-chosen post with her stove and kettle, in any shelter she could find, brewing tea for all who wanted it, and they were many. Sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day, but Mrs. Seacole was always equal, to the occasion\". But Seacole did more than carry tea to the suffering soldiers. She often carried bags of lint, bandages, needles and thread to tend to the wounds of soldiers.<ref name=\"nlj.gov.jm\"/>\n\nIn late August, Seacole was on the route to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, and it was clear that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications to the north of the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole fulfilled a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\">Seacole, Chapter XVII.</ref> Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long painting of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 138.</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Sevastopol, hostilities continued in a desultory fashion.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVIII\">Seacole, Chapter XVIII.</ref> The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days.<ref>Robinson, p. 145.</ref> There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.<ref>Robinson, pp. 146\u201347.</ref>\n\nSeacole was joined by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer described her as \"the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah\", with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel [[Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet|Henry Bunbury]]. However, there is no evidence that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband.<ref>Robinson, p. 155.</ref> Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.<ref>Ramdin, pp. 120\u201323.</ref>\n\nPeace talks began in Paris in early 1856, and friendly relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\">Seacole, Chapter XIX.</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 March 1856, after which the soldiers left Crimea.

The evacuation of the Allied armies was formally completed at Balaclava on 9 July 1856, with Seacole \"...&nbsp;conspicuous in the foreground&nbsp;...&nbsp;dressed in a plaid riding-habit&nbsp;...\".<ref>Robinson, p. 153, quoting the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 30 August 1856.</ref> Seacole was one of the last to leave Crimea, returning to England \"poorer than [she] left it\".<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\" /> Though she had left poorer, her impact on the soldiers was invaluable to the soldiers she treated, changing their perceptions about her as described in ''the Illustrated London News:'' \"Perhaps at first the authorities looked askant at the woman-volunteer; but they soon found her worth and utility; and from that time until the British army left the Crimea, Mother Seacole was a household word in the camp...In her store on Spring Hill she attended many patients, nursed many sick, and earned the good will and gratitude of hundreds\".<ref name=\":1\">Literature Review. ''The Illustrated London News.'' Elm House, 25 July 1857, pg. 105.</ref>\n\nSociology professor Lynn McDonald is co-founder of The [[Nightingale Society]], which promotes the legacy of Nightingale, who did not see eye-to-eye with Seacole. McDonald believes that Seacole's role in the Crimean War was overplayed:<ref>TLS, 6 Dec 2013 p.24</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mary Seacole, although never the 'black British nurse' she is claimed to have been, was a successful mixed-race immigrant to Britain.   She led an adventurous life, and her memoir of 1857 is still a lively read.   She was kind and generous.   She made friends of her customers, army and navy officers, who came to her rescue with a fund when she was declared bankrupt.   While her cures have been vastly exaggerated, she doubtless did what she could to ease suffering, when no effective cures existed.   In epidemics pre-Crimea, she said a comforting word to the dying and closed the eyes of the dead.   During the Crimean War, probably her greatest kindness was to serve hot tea and lemonade to cold, suffering soldiers awaiting transport to hospital on the wharf at Balaclava.   She deserves much credit for rising to the occasion, but her tea and lemonade did not save lives, pioneer nursing or advance health care.}}\n\nHowever, historians maintain that claims that Seacole only served \"tea and lemonade\" do a disservice to the tradition of Jamaican \"doctresses\", such as Seacole's mother, [[Cubah Cornwallis]], Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, who cared for Jamaica's wealthiest planter of the 18th century, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)]]. They all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle. Social historian Jane Robinson argues in her book ''Mary Seacole: The Black Woman who invented Modern Nursing'' that Seacole was a huge success, and she became known and loved by everyone from the rank and file to the royal family.<ref>[https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781845294977 ''MARY SEACOLE'' by Jane Robinson] at Little, Brown.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Anwionwu, [http://www.mixedracestudies.org/?tag=mary-jane-grant-seacole \"Scotching Three Myths About Mary Seacole\"], ''British Journal of Healthcare Assistants'', Vol. 7, Issue 10 (October 2013), pp. 508\u2013511.

In the conclusion to her autobiography, she records that she \"took the opportunity\" to visit \"yet other lands\" on her return journey, although Robinson attributes this to her impecunious state requiring a roundabout trip. She arrived in August 1856 and opened a canteen with Day at [[Aldershot]], but the venture failed through lack of funds.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-41194 Mary Jane Seacole - [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] 2006]</ref> She attended a celebratory dinner for 2,000&nbsp;soldiers at [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] in [[Kennington]] on 25 August 1856, at which Nightingale was chief guest of honour.

However, creditors who had supplied her firm in Crimea were in pursuit. She was forced to move to 1, Tavistock Street, [[Covent Garden]] in increasingly dire financial straits.

The article observes, \"It will be evident, from the foregoing, that Mother Seacole has sunk much lower in the world, and is also in danger of rising much higher in it, than is consistent with the honour of the British army, and the generosity of the British public.\" While urging the public to donate, the commentary's tone can be read as ironic: \"Who would give a guinea to see a mimic-sutler woman, and a foreigner, frisk and amble about on the stage, when he might bestow the money on a genuine English one, reduced to a two-pair back, and in imminent danger of being obliged to climb into an attic?\"<ref>\"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re.\" ''Punch''. 30 May 1857, pg. 221.</ref>\n[[File:MarySeacole Punch.jpg|thumb|Mary Seacole, depicted as an admirer of ''Punch'' along with her British Crimean War patients in \"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re\" (''Punch,'' 30 May 1857).]]\nFurther fund-raising and literary mentions kept Seacole in the public eye. In May 1857 she wanted to travel to India, to minister to the wounded of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but she was dissuaded by both the new Secretary of War, [[Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie|Lord Panmure]],<ref>Robinson, p. 179.</ref> and her financial troubles.<ref>Robinson, p. 169.</ref> Fund-raising activities included the \"Seacole Fund Grand Military Festival\", which was held at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]], from Monday 27 July to Thursday 30 July 1857.

However, production costs had been high and the Royal Surrey Gardens Company was itself having financial problems. It became insolvent immediately after the festival, and as a result Seacole only received [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]57, one quarter of the profits from the event.

{"title_page": "List of file formats", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Cleanup reorganize|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{dynamic list}}\nThis is a '''list of file formats''' used by [[computer]]s, organized by type. [[Filename extension]]s are usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the [[file format]] name or abbreviation. Many [[operating system]]s do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) file system.  Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows NT|NT]], [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows Me|ME]] which have no three character limit on extensions for [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] applications on [[file system]]s other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system.  Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters.  While MS-DOS and NT always see the final period in a filename as an extension, in UNIX-like systems, the final period doesn't necessarily mean the text afterward is the extension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html|title=Filename extension definition|website=The Linux Information Project|access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome file formats, such as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.text</code>, may be listed multiple times.\n\n== Archive and compressed ==\n{{main|List of archive formats}}\n* .?Q? \u2013 files that are compressed, often by the [[SQ (program)|SQ program]].\n* [[7z (file format)|7z]] \u2013 7-Zip compressed file\n* AAPKG \u2013 [[ArchestrA Object Package|ArchestrA IDE]]\n* AAC \u2013 [[Advanced Audio Coding]]\n* [[aCE (compression file format)|ace]] \u2013 ACE compressed file\n* ALZ \u2013 [[ALZip]] compressed file\n* [[APK (file format)|APK]] \u2013 Applications installable on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n* APPX \u2013 Microsoft Application Package (.appx)\n* AT3 \u2013 Sony's UMD data compression\n* .bke \u2013 BackupEarth.com data compression\n* [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] \u2013 pre-Zip data compression\n* ARC - [[Nintendo]] U8 Archive (mostly Yaz0 compressed)\n* [[ARJ]] \u2013 ARJ compressed file\n* [[SubStation Alpha|ASS (also SAS)]] \u2013 a subtitles file created by [[Aegisub]], a video typesetting application (also a [[Halo (series)|Halo]] game engine file)\n* B \u2013 (B file) Similar to .a, but a little less compressed...\n* [[.ba (archive format)|BA]] \u2013 Scifer Archive (.ba), Scifer External Archive Type\n* [[.big|big]] \u2013 Special file compression format used by Electronic Arts to compress the data for many of EA's games\n* BIN \u2013 compressed archive, can be read and used by CD-ROMs and Java, extractable by 7-zip and WINRAR\n* bjsn \u2013 Used to store The Escapists saves on Android. \n* BKF (.bkf) \u2013 Microsoft backup created by [[NTBackup]].c\n* [[bzip2]] (.bz2) \u2013 \n* [[Skyscraper Sim building|bld]] \u2013 Skyscraper Simulator Building\n* [[Cabinet (file format)|cab]] \u2013 A cabinet (.cab) file is a library of compressed files stored as one file.

[[Filename extension]]s are usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the [[file format]] name or abbreviation. Many [[operating system]]s do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) file system.  Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows NT|NT]], [[Windows 95|95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows Me|ME]] which have no three character limit on extensions for [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] applications on [[file system]]s other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system.  Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters.  While MS-DOS and NT always see the final period in a filename as an extension, in UNIX-like systems, the final period doesn't necessarily mean the text afterward is the extension.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html|title=Filename extension definition|website=The Linux Information Project|access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome file formats, such as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.text</code>, may be listed multiple times.\n\n== Archive and compressed ==\n{{main|List of archive formats}}\n* .?Q? \u2013 files that are compressed, often by the [[SQ (program)|SQ program]].\n* [[7z (file format)|7z]] \u2013 7-Zip compressed file\n* AAPKG \u2013 [[ArchestrA Object Package|ArchestrA IDE]]\n* AAC \u2013 [[Advanced Audio Coding]]\n* [[aCE (compression file format)|ace]] \u2013 ACE compressed file\n* ALZ \u2013 [[ALZip]] compressed file\n* [[APK (file format)|APK]] \u2013 Applications installable on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n* APPX \u2013 Microsoft Application Package (.appx)\n* AT3 \u2013 Sony's UMD data compression\n* .bke \u2013 BackupEarth.com data compression\n* [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] \u2013 pre-Zip data compression\n* ARC - [[Nintendo]] U8 Archive (mostly Yaz0 compressed)\n* [[ARJ]] \u2013 ARJ compressed file\n* [[SubStation Alpha|ASS (also SAS)]] \u2013 a subtitles file created by [[Aegisub]], a video typesetting application (also a [[Halo (series)|Halo]] game engine file)\n* B \u2013 (B file) Similar to .a, but a little less compressed...\n* [[.ba (archive format)|BA]] \u2013 Scifer Archive (.ba), Scifer External Archive Type\n* [[.big|big]] \u2013 Special file compression format used by Electronic Arts to compress the data for many of EA's games\n* BIN \u2013 compressed archive, can be read and used by CD-ROMs and Java, extractable by 7-zip and WINRAR\n* bjsn \u2013 Used to store The Escapists saves on Android. \n* BKF (.bkf) \u2013 Microsoft backup created by [[NTBackup]].c\n* [[bzip2]] (.bz2) \u2013 \n* [[Skyscraper Sim building|bld]] \u2013 Skyscraper Simulator Building\n* [[Cabinet (file format)|cab]] \u2013 A cabinet (.cab) file is a library of compressed files stored as one file.

During the 300-year rule by the Spanish, Mexico was a crossroad for the people and cultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The government of independent Mexico actively promoted shared cultural traits in order to create a national identity.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe culture of an individual Mexican is influenced by their familial ties, gender, religion, location, and social class, among other factors. In many ways, contemporary life in the cities of Mexico has become similar to that in neighboring United States and Europe, with provincial people conserving traditions more than city dwellers.\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Religion in Mexico}}\n{{See also|Holy Week in Mexico|Our Lady of Guadalupe|Child Jesus images in Mexico}}\n[[File:Peregrinos Guadalupanos llegan a la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupanos]] pilgrims arrive in Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Cubilete.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Cerro del Cubilete]] (\"Dice Cup Hill\").

Mexico is a [[secular state]], and the [[Constitution of 1917]] and [[anti-clerical]] law imposed limitations on the church and sometimes codified state intrusion into church matters.

XIX (The Valley of Mexico).]]\n\nMexico is known for its [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|folk art]] traditions, mostly derived from the indigenous and Spanish crafts. Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements. Mexican art [[photography]] was largely fostered by the work of [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros|title=Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros. : Mexico Culture & Arts|website=www.mexconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Mexican literature}}\n[[Image:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|175px|thumb|A late 18th-century painting of [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]], poet and writer.]]\n\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Netzahualcoyotl]]. Modern Mexican literature is influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of [[Mesoamerica]]. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]] and [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]].\n\nOther notable writers include [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Lizardi]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Maruxa Vilalta]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Octavio Paz]] (Nobel Laureate), [[Renato Leduc]], [[Mariano Azuela]] (\"Los de abajo\"), [[Juan Rulfo]] (\"Pedro P\u00e1ramo\") and [[Bruno Traven]].\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Mexico}}\n\nMexico is the most populous [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spanish-language.com/spanish-language/|title=Learn Spanish in Mexico - Spanish Courses in Mexico - Spanish Schools in Mexico|accessdate=2010-02-18|publisher=Spanish-Language.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917232618/http://www.spanish-language.com/spanish-language/|archivedate=2010-09-17}}</ref> Although the overwhelming majority of Mexicans today speak Spanish, there is no ''[[de jure]]'' official language at the federal level.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is reputed to have declared the [[Puuc]]-style architecture of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] as the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Freidel\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0703/abstracts/maya.html |title=Betraying the Maya |publisher=Archeology Magazine |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Spanish Baroque]] dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution. The [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]] is the name given to the period between 1935 and 1959, where the quality and economic success of the cinema of Mexico reached its peak. An era when renowned actors such as [[Cantinflas]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] appeared on the silver screen.\n\nPresent-day film makers include [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] (''[[Amores perros]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''), [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] (''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''), [[Guillermo del Toro]] (''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''), [[Carlos Reygadas]] (''[[Silent Light|Stellet Licht]]''), screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] and owners [[Guillermo Navarro]] and [[Emmanuel Lubezki]].\n\n==National holidays==\n{{Main|Public holidays in Mexico}}\n\n{{see also|Christmas in Mexico}}\n\n[[Image:GritoIxmiquilpan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Municipal president giving the \"[[Grito de Dolores|grito]]\" of \"Viva M\u00e9xico\" at the commencement of Independence Day festivities in 2008]]\n\nMexicans celebrate their [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence from Spain]] on September 16, and other holidays with festivals known as \"Fiestas\". Many Mexican cities, towns, and villages hold a yearly festival to commemorate their local patron saints. During these festivities, the people pray and burn candles to honor their saints in churches decorated with flowers and colorful utensils. They also hold large parades, fireworks, dance competitions, beauty pageant contest, party and buy refreshments in the marketplaces and public squares. In the smaller towns and villages, soccer, and boxing are also celebrated during the festivities.\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 350px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = Dulces de amaranto.jpg\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = Skulls made of [[amaranto]], given during the [[Day of the Dead]] festival.\n   | image2    = \u00a1Feliz Dia de la Revolucion Mexico!.jpg\n   | width2   = \n   | caption2  =  [[Revolution Day]] marking the start of what became the Mexican Revolution.\n  }}\n\nOther festivities include D\u00eda de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe Day\"), [[Las Posadas]] (\"The Shelters\", celebrated on December 16 to December 24), [[Nochebuena|Noche Buena]] (\"Holy Night\", celebrated on December 24), [[Christmas|Navidad]] (\"Christmas\", celebrated on December 25) and [[New Year's Day|A\u00f1o Nuevo]] (\"New Year's Day\", celebrated on December 31 to January 1).\n\n\"Guadalupe Day\" is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.

The gifts presented turn the graveyard from a dull and sorrowful place to an intimate and hospitable environment to celebrate the dead.<ref name=\"mexican halloween\"/>\n\nIn modern Mexico and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as [[Halloween]], due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.\n\nA [[pi\u00f1ata]] is made from papier-mache. It is created to look like popular people, animals, or fictional characters. Once made it is painted with bright colors and filled with candy or small toys. It is then hung from the ceiling. The children are blindfolded and take turns hitting the pi\u00f1ata until it breaks open and the candy and small toys fall out. The children then gather the candy and small toys.\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Mexican cuisine}}\n[[File:Hermenegildo Bustos - Still life with fruit (with scorpion and frog) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Still-life with Fruit, Scorpion and Frog (1874) by [[Hermenegildo Bustos]].]]\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    = Chile en nogada.jpg\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = ''[[Chiles en nogada]]'', a popular dish from Mexico\n   | image2    = 001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg\n   | width2   = \n   | caption2  = [[Tacos]] of [[carnitas]], [[carne asada]] and [[al pastor]]\n  }}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = Mole in Puebla.JPG\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = [[Mole sauce#mole poblano|Mole poblano]] is considered Mexico's ''[[national dish#platos nacionales|plato nacional]]''\n  }}\n\n[[File:Ate (dulce mexicano).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pear]], [[Quince]] and [[Psidium]] [[cajeta]].

Popular beverages include water flavored with a variety of fruit juices, and cinnamon-flavored [[hot chocolate]] prepared with [[milk]] or water and blended until it becomes [[frothed]] using a traditional wooden tool called a ''[[Molinillo (whisk)|molinillo]]''. Alcoholic beverages native to Mexico include [[Mezcal|mescal]], [[pulque]], and [[tequila]]. [[Mexican beer]] is also popular in Mexico and are exported. There are international award-winning Mexican wineries that produce and export [[Mexican wine|wine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiff.com/a/wine-baja.htm|title=Mexico Wine Routes & Regions - Vineyards & Wineries of Baja|accessdate=2010-02-18|publisher=chiff.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important and frequently used spices in Mexican cuisine are [[chili powder]], [[cumin]], [[oregano]], [[cilantro]], [[epazote]], [[cinnamon]], and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]. [[Chipotle]], a smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is also common in Mexican cuisine. Many Mexican dishes also contain [[onion]]s and [[garlic]], which are also some of Mexico's staple foods.\n\nNext to [[Maize|corn]], [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]].

Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M. Ponce]] (\"Estrellita\"), Revueltas, Jord\u00e1 (Elodia), [[Ricardo Castro]], [[Juventino Rosas]] (\"Sobre las olas\"), Carrillo (Sonido 13), Ibarra, Pablo Moncayo (Huapango) and [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]].\n\nPopular composers includes: [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez]] (\"[[B\u00e9same mucho]]\"), [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[\u00c1lvaro Carrillo]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardav\u00e9]] and [[Alfonso Ortiz Tirado]].\n\nTraditional Mexican music has influenced the evolution of the [[Mexican pop]] and [[Mexican rock]] genre. Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as [[Lila Downs]].\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}\n[[File:Azteca 008.png|thumb|Club Am\u00e9rica vs Cruz Azul at the [[Estadio Azteca]].]]\n\nThe traditional national sport of Mexico is [[Charreria]], which consists of a series of equestrian events.

Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic.

During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution.

They also hold large parades, fireworks, dance competitions, beauty pageant contest, party and buy refreshments in the marketplaces and public squares. In the smaller towns and villages, soccer, and boxing are also celebrated during the festivities.\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 350px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = Dulces de amaranto.jpg\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = Skulls made of [[amaranto]], given during the [[Day of the Dead]] festival.\n   | image2    = \u00a1Feliz Dia de la Revolucion Mexico!.jpg\n   | width2   = \n   | caption2  =  [[Revolution Day]] marking the start of what became the Mexican Revolution.\n  }}\n\nOther festivities include D\u00eda de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe Day\"), [[Las Posadas]] (\"The Shelters\", celebrated on December 16 to December 24), [[Nochebuena|Noche Buena]] (\"Holy Night\", celebrated on December 24), [[Christmas|Navidad]] (\"Christmas\", celebrated on December 25) and [[New Year's Day|A\u00f1o Nuevo]] (\"New Year's Day\", celebrated on December 31 to January 1).\n\n\"Guadalupe Day\" is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country. It honors the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, which is celebrated on December 12. In the last decade, all the celebrations happening from mid-December to the beginning of January have been linked together in what has been called the [[Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon]].\n\n[[File:Poinsettia_thumbnail.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Since the 16th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with [[Christmas]] carrying the Christian symbolism of the [[Star of Bethlehem]]; in that country it is known in Spanish as the ''Flower of the Holy Night''.<ref name=\"Hewitson2013\">{{cite book |last1=Hewitson |first1=Carolyn |title=Festivals |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135057060 |quote=It is said to resemble the star of Bethlehem.

Rather, it is the three wise men who are the bearers of gifts, who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ricardo Botto|url=http://www.mexonline.com/history-lostresreyes.htm|title=Dia de Reyes, the story of Los Tres Reyes Magos|publisher=Mexonline.com|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref> Mexican families also commemorate the date by eating ''[[Rosca de reyes]]''.\n\nThe [[Day of the Dead]] incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with [[Christianity|Christian]] elements. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. There is an idea behind this day that suggests the living must attend to the dead so that the dead will protect the living.<ref name=\"mexican halloween\">{{cite web |last1=Franco |first1=Gina |last2=Poore |first2=Christopher |title=Day of the Dead is not \"Mexican Halloween\"\u2014it\u2019s a day where death is reclaimed. |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/11/01/day-dead-not-mexican-halloween-its-day-where-death-reclaimed |website=America Magazine |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=en |date=1 November 2017}}</ref> The celebration occurs on November 2 in connection with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] holidays of [[All Saints' Day]] (November 1) and [[All Souls' Day]] (November 2). Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars honoring the deceased using [[sugar skull]]s, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts. The gifts presented turn the graveyard from a dull and sorrowful place to an intimate and hospitable environment to celebrate the dead.<ref name=\"mexican halloween\"/>\n\nIn modern Mexico and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as [[Halloween]], due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.\n\nA [[pi\u00f1ata]] is made from papier-mache.

The children then gather the candy and small toys.\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Mexican cuisine}}\n[[File:Hermenegildo Bustos - Still life with fruit (with scorpion and frog) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Still-life with Fruit, Scorpion and Frog (1874) by [[Hermenegildo Bustos]].]]\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = right\n   | image1    = Chile en nogada.jpg\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = ''[[Chiles en nogada]]'', a popular dish from Mexico\n   | image2    = 001_Tacos_de_carnitas,_carne_asada_y_al_pastor.jpg\n   | width2   = \n   | caption2  = [[Tacos]] of [[carnitas]], [[carne asada]] and [[al pastor]]\n  }}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = Mole in Puebla.JPG\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = [[Mole sauce#mole poblano|Mole poblano]] is considered Mexico's ''[[national dish#platos nacionales|plato nacional]]''\n  }}\n\n[[File:Ate (dulce mexicano).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pear]], [[Quince]] and [[Psidium]] [[cajeta]].

The cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00400 |title=Traditional Mexican cuisine - ancestral, ongoing community culture, the Michoac\u00e1n paradigm |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}</ref> Traditionally, the main Mexican ingredients consisted of [[maize]], [[bean]]s, both [[red meat|red]] and [[white meat]]s, [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[seafood]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[Cucurbita|squash]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[avocado]]s and various herbs native to Mexico.\n\nPopular dishes include [[taco]]s, [[enchilada]]s, [[mole sauce]], [[atole]], [[tamale]]s, and [[pozole]]. Popular beverages include water flavored with a variety of fruit juices, and cinnamon-flavored [[hot chocolate]] prepared with [[milk]] or water and blended until it becomes [[frothed]] using a traditional wooden tool called a ''[[Molinillo (whisk)|molinillo]]''. Alcoholic beverages native to Mexico include [[Mezcal|mescal]], [[pulque]], and [[tequila]]. [[Mexican beer]] is also popular in Mexico and are exported. There are international award-winning Mexican wineries that produce and export [[Mexican wine|wine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiff.com/a/wine-baja.htm|title=Mexico Wine Routes & Regions - Vineyards & Wineries of Baja|accessdate=2010-02-18|publisher=chiff.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most important and frequently used spices in Mexican cuisine are [[chili powder]], [[cumin]], [[oregano]], [[cilantro]], [[epazote]], [[cinnamon]], and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]]. [[Chipotle]], a smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is also common in Mexican cuisine. Many Mexican dishes also contain [[onion]]s and [[garlic]], which are also some of Mexico's staple foods.\n\nNext to [[Maize|corn]], [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]].

MFF Pra\u017esk\u00fd jarmark 3540.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Northern Dance in Nuevo Leon]]\n\nThe foundation of Mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the [[teponaztli]]), [[flute]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], [[conch]]es as trumpets and their [[voice]]s to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many [[old world]] influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the [[Mexican vihuela]] used in [[Mariachi music]], were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.\n\n[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]] in the traditional [[China Poblana]] dress.]]\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido (Mexico)|Corrido]]s. Mexicans also listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]] and [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]]. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in the [[Americas]] and parts of Europe.\n\nFolk songs called [[corridos]] have been popular in Mexico since the early nineteen hundreds. It may tell the story of the Mexican Revolution, pride, [[Mestizaje]], romance, poverty, politics or crime. Notable [[Afro-Mexican]] contributions to the country's music are the [[Son Jarocho]] and the [[marimba]].\n\nMariachis perform along streets, festivals and restaurants. A common Mariachi group can include singers, [[violin]]s, a [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]], a [[guitarra de golpe]], vihuela, [[guitar]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The most prominent Mariachi group is [[Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n]], which was originally formed in 1897.\n\n[[File:PolancoVoladoresdePapantla.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Danza de los Voladores]], a ritual dance performed by the [[Totonacs]].]]\n\nOther styles of traditional regional music in M\u00e9xico: [[Huapango]] or [[Son Huasteco]] (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and [[jarana huasteca|jarana]]), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly [[brass instruments]]) [[Duranguense]], Jarana (most of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula) and [[Norte\u00f1a]] (North style, [[redoba]] and [[accordion]]).\n\nFolk dances are a feature of Mexican culture. Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M. Ponce]] (\"Estrellita\"), Revueltas, Jord\u00e1 (Elodia), [[Ricardo Castro]], [[Juventino Rosas]] (\"Sobre las olas\"), Carrillo (Sonido 13), Ibarra, Pablo Moncayo (Huapango) and [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]].\n\nPopular composers includes: [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez]] (\"[[B\u00e9same mucho]]\"), [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[\u00c1lvaro Carrillo]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardav\u00e9]] and [[Alfonso Ortiz Tirado]].\n\nTraditional Mexican music has influenced the evolution of the [[Mexican pop]] and [[Mexican rock]] genre. Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as [[Lila Downs]].\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}\n[[File:Azteca 008.png|thumb|Club Am\u00e9rica vs Cruz Azul at the [[Estadio Azteca]].]]\n\nThe traditional national sport of Mexico is [[Charreria]], which consists of a series of equestrian events. The national horse of Mexico, used in [[Charreria]], is the [[Azteca (horse)|Azteca]]. [[Bullfighting]], a tradition brought from Spain, is also popular. Mexico has the largest venue for bullfighting in the world - the [[Plaza M\u00e9xico]] in Mexico City which seats 48,000 people.\n\n[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular team sport in Mexico. Most states have their own representative football teams. Among the country's significant teams include [[C.D.

The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

This new rating system also focused more of the overall score on pedestrian protection; Euro NCAP were concerned that car manufacturers were too fixed on occupant safety rather than the safety of those outside the vehicle. Results of the first cars to be tested under the new scheme were released in February 2009.\n\nOver the years, European automakers' cars have become much safer, partly as a result of the Euro NCAP standards. Test results are commonly presented by motor press, and in turn, greatly influence consumer demand for a vehicle. One notable example of this is the [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]] (an update of a 1980 design, first marketed as an [[Austin ]]), which after receiving a one-star Adult Occupant Rating in the tests in 1997, suffered from poor sales and was withdrawn from production soon afterwards: it was the '[[What Car]]' car of the year, for 1980.<ref name= \"racfoundation.org\">{{cite web|url= http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=327&Itemid=0 |title=Ten Years of Crashing New Cars|accessdate= 26 January 2008 |work= racfoundation.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711191346/http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=327&Itemid=0 |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref> [[BMW]]'s 2007 [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], for example, had its bonnet and headlamp fixture changed to meet the latest pedestrian safety requirements.<ref name= \"edmunds.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=116748|title=Exclusive first drive of the refreshed British small car|accessdate= 26 January 2008|work=edmunds.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921010439/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D116748|archivedate=21 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nTesting is not mandatory, with vehicle models either being independently chosen by Euro NCAP or sponsored by the manufacturers.<ref name=\"Cars chosen for testing\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.euroncap.com/Content-Web-Faq/5076ae48-c23c-4933-ad63-0449b3a6425b/cars-chosen-for-testing.aspx|title=Cars chosen for testing|accessdate=19 July 2010|work= euroncap.com| publisher= Euro NCAP | url-status= dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006165627/http://euroncap.com/Content-Web-Faq/5076ae48-c23c-4933-ad63-0449b3a6425b/cars-chosen-for-testing.aspx|archivedate= 6 October 2010}}</ref> In Europe, new cars are certified as legal for sale under the [[Motor vehicle type approval|Whole Vehicle Type Approval]] regimen that differs from Euro NCAP.

The top overall rating is five stars.\n\nThe frontal tests are performed at {{convert|64|km/h|mph||abbr=on}} into an offset deformable barrier.

This new rating system also focused more of the overall score on pedestrian protection; Euro NCAP were concerned that car manufacturers were too fixed on occupant safety rather than the safety of those outside the vehicle. Results of the first cars to be tested under the new scheme were released in February 2009.\n\nOver the years, European automakers' cars have become much safer, partly as a result of the Euro NCAP standards. Test results are commonly presented by motor press, and in turn, greatly influence consumer demand for a vehicle. One notable example of this is the [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]] (an update of a 1980 design, first marketed as an [[Austin ]]), which after receiving a one-star Adult Occupant Rating in the tests in 1997, suffered from poor sales and was withdrawn from production soon afterwards: it was the '[[What Car]]' car of the year, for 1980.<ref name= \"racfoundation.org\">{{cite web|url= http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=327&Itemid=0 |title=Ten Years of Crashing New Cars|accessdate= 26 January 2008 |work= racfoundation.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711191346/http://www.racfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=327&Itemid=0 |archivedate=11 July 2007 }}</ref> [[BMW]]'s 2007 [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], for example, had its bonnet and headlamp fixture changed to meet the latest pedestrian safety requirements.<ref name= \"edmunds.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=116748|title=Exclusive first drive of the refreshed British small car|accessdate= 26 January 2008|work=edmunds.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921010439/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D116748|archivedate=21 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nTesting is not mandatory, with vehicle models either being independently chosen by Euro NCAP or sponsored by the manufacturers.<ref name=\"Cars chosen for testing\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.euroncap.com/Content-Web-Faq/5076ae48-c23c-4933-ad63-0449b3a6425b/cars-chosen-for-testing.aspx|title=Cars chosen for testing|accessdate=19 July 2010|work= euroncap.com| publisher= Euro NCAP | url-status= dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006165627/http://euroncap.com/Content-Web-Faq/5076ae48-c23c-4933-ad63-0449b3a6425b/cars-chosen-for-testing.aspx|archivedate= 6 October 2010}}</ref> In Europe, new cars are certified as legal for sale under the [[Motor vehicle type approval|Whole Vehicle Type Approval]] regimen that differs from Euro NCAP.

However, much higher performance requirements are used by Euro NCAP.

Progress with vehicle safety legislation can be slow, particularly as all EU Member States\u2019 views have to be taken into account. Also, once in place, legislation provides no further incentive to improve, whereas Euro NCAP provides a continuing incentive by regularly enhancing its assessment procedures to stimulate further improvements in vehicle safety.\"\n\n==Comparing test results==\n\nThe Euro NCAP frontal impact tests simulates crashing a car into another of \"similar mass and structure\".
