Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools.

The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration.

Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\n\n[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|left|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]\nMondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, \"At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,69286,00.html|title=Mondale Concedes to Coleman|work=Fox News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the [[Constitution Project]]'s bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee.<ref>[http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814000144/http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6|date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> He endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127223358/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039|date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.\n\nFollowing the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2004]] and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen talking with [[Al Franken]] about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for Senate in 2008 in the documentary ''[[Al Franken: God Spoke]]''.<ref>Al Franken: God Spoke at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman's allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him.

He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], to Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher, and Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |title=American President: Walter Mondale |publisher=Millercenter.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704011945/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |archivedate=July 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389066/Walter-Mondale |title=Walter Mondale|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Walter_Mondale.htm |title=Walter F.

Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration.

His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\n\n[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|left|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]\nMondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Also, Mondale was perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).

Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock.

A good working Kelpie is a versatile dog \u2013 they can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends.

However they do require a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Otherwise they can get bored and be disruptive by constantly barking or digging, or by chewing on things. Taking them on medium to long walks or playing fetch are great ways to keep them stimulated.

A good working Kelpie is a versatile dog \u2013 they can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends.

However they do require a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Otherwise they can get bored and be disruptive by constantly barking or digging, or by chewing on things. Taking them on medium to long walks or playing fetch are great ways to keep them stimulated. They are also naturally curious so It\u2019s recommended that owners have large enough yards for them to explore and run in.\n\n== Health ==\nKelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems, but they are susceptible to disorders common to all breeds, like [[cryptorchidism]], [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[cerebellar abiotrophy]] and [[luxating patella]].

All games must have features exclusive to the console, and must be rated E or E10+ by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]]. Intellivision Entertainment plan to release a mixture of completely new games, updated classic games and motion control games for the Amico. Updated versions of many of the popular classic Intellivision games will be available with improved graphics and sound and, unlike previous Intellivision compilations, will include some previous third-party licenses, such as ''[[Tron: Deadly Discs]]''. New versions of several classic Atari games, as well as games from [[Imagic]] and arcade classics such as ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' and ''[[BurgerTime]]'' are expected around launch. Downloadable games will cost between US2.99 and US$9.99.

The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart. Julia's three romantic figures Rhys calls \"Mr\" (Mr Mackenzie, Mr Horsfield and Mr James).\n\nThe title is a reversal of premise. Mr Mackenzie has left Julia Martin rather than vice-versa.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face with her glove and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after leaving Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris.

Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face with her glove and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after leaving Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quai Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel.
