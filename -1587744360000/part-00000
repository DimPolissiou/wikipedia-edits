It is a reworking of his 1876 painting ''On The Thames'', which also depicts a man and two women in a boat. It measures {{convert|15.0|x|21.5|in|cm}}.\n\nThe painting depicts three people sitting in a rowing boat among the towering naval vessels in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], with another rowing boat crewed by naval personnel passing in the background before the bows of two old-fashioned [[square rigged]] [[ship of the line|ships of the line]].  In the background is a modern [[ironclad warship]].  In the centre is a man wearing the uniform of a sergeant in a [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland Regiment]], with [[red coat (military uniform)|redcoat]], [[kilt]], and [[feather bonnet]].  He sits with his legs crossed, and his hands clasped around one bare knee.  He is turning away from the unhappy woman to his left - in cream dress and tartan shawl or blanket, and her [[parasol]] up - and towards the smiling woman to his right - in white and black striped dress, with shawl over her arm and parasol furled.\n\nThis 1877 painting is a reworking of Tissot's 1876 painting ''On The Thames'', which depicts a man and two women reclining lazily aboard a boat moving through crowded shipping on the [[River Thames]].  ''On The Thames'' was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1876 but it was poorly received, with critics questioning the sexual morality of the subjects: one critic described it as \"wilfully vulgar\", and another disparagingly as \"more French than English\".  Tissot's less ambiguous 1877 reworking of the subject in ''Portsmouth Dockyard'' was more favourably received, but the story remains unclear.  Perhaps there is some flirtation between the man and the woman to the left; perhaps the second woman a chaperone, or a sister.\n\nThe painting was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1877 under the title ''Portsmouth Dockyard''.  The same year, Tissot made a [[drypoint]] copy of the painting, which was reproduced as an [[etching]] in two editions of around 100 prints each, measuring {{convert|9.75|x|13.75|in}}, under the French title ''Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance'' (literally, \"Between the two my heart swings\"; sometimes translated as \"How happy I could be with either\").  An etching of the drypoint reproduction was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2013 for \u00a31,125, described as a work on \"the theme of comic rivalry in the affairs of the heart\", and one was sold at [[Bonhams]] in 2018 for $937.\n\nThe painting was bought by the Lancashire corn merchant Henry Jump, and descended through his family.  It was sold at [[Christie's]] in 1937 under the title ''Divided Attention'', bought by [[Leicester Galleries]] for 58 guineas, and exhibited at Leicester Galleries under the title ''Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance'' (the title of Tissot's drypoint and etching of the same subject).   The painting was sold to Sir [[Hugh Walpole]], who left it to the [[Tate Gallery]] on his death in 1941.   The Tate first exhibited it in 1942 under the title ''How happy could he be with either'', later returning to the original title ''Portsmouth Dockyard''.

While the springs were adequate at the lower speeds of horse-drawn vehicles, they proved dangerous at higher speeds because they continued to bounce after hitting an uneven surface, potentially causing the vehicle to veer out of control. Early bicycles had a similar problem.<ref name=cyclopaedia />\n\n[[File:Andre Hartford friction disk shock absorber (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Truffault-Hartford shock absorber]]\nIn 1899, Edward was in France at a bicycle race where the winning bicycle was equipped with an early shock absorber built by J. Truffault. Hartford bought the rights to the device and perfected its design. In 1904, he established the Hartford Suspension Company and located the firm on Hudson Street in New York City. That year, a car built by [[Richard-Brasier]] equipped with Truffault-Hartford shock absorbers won the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)]] in Germany, helping to establish a reputation for the new device. In 1908, the factory was moved to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] next to the A&P headquarters. Edward continued to develop new features for automobiles.  In 1910, he received a patent for an electric starter and the next year for an electric brake.<ref name=cyclopaedia />\n\nIn 1901, Hartford married Henrietta Guerard Pollitzer (1881\u20131948), a socialite whose mother was descended from an old Charleston, South Carolina family.  Edward and Henrietta lived on Park Avenue where they were prominent in New York society. They had two children: Josephine Hartford O'Donnell Bryce (1902\u20131992) and [[Huntington Hartford]] (1911\u20132008). After Edward's company moved to Jersey City, the family moved to [[Deal, New Jersey]], a wealthy community on the shore. Edward was an exceptional violinist and active in sports, including golf, ice skating, and yachting.<ref name=anderson /> In 1920, he received a patent for a \"scientific putter\". A Christian Scientist, he refused to see a doctor and died at age 51.<ref name=levinson />  \n\nNow a wealthy widow, Henrietta moved with her children to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] where she ultimately purchased Seaverage, next to the [[Rough Point]] mansion owned by [[Doris Duke]]. In 1937, she married an Italian aristocrat, Guido Pignatelli (1900\u20131967), [[Prince of Belmonte]], who was only two years older than her daughter.

While the springs were adequate at the lower speeds of horse-drawn vehicles, they proved dangerous at higher speeds because they continued to bounce after hitting an uneven surface, potentially causing the vehicle to veer out of control. Early bicycles had a similar problem.<ref name=cyclopaedia />\n\n[[File:Andre Hartford friction disk shock absorber (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Truffault-Hartford shock absorber]]\nIn 1899, Edward was in France at a bicycle race where the winning bicycle was equipped with an early shock absorber built by J. Truffault. Hartford bought the rights to the device and perfected its design. In 1904, he established the Hartford Suspension Company and located the firm on Hudson Street in New York City. That year, a car built by [[Richard-Brasier]] equipped with Truffault-Hartford shock absorbers won the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (auto racing)]] in Germany, helping to establish a reputation for the new device. In 1908, the factory was moved to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] next to the A&P headquarters. Edward continued to develop new features for automobiles.  In 1910, he received a patent for an electric starter and the next year for an electric brake.<ref name=cyclopaedia />\n\nIn 1901, Hartford married Henrietta Guerard Pollitzer (1881\u20131948), a socialite whose mother was descended from an old Charleston, South Carolina family.  Edward and Henrietta lived on Park Avenue where they were prominent in New York society. They had two children: Josephine Hartford O'Donnell Bryce (1902\u20131992) and [[Huntington Hartford]] (1911\u20132008). After Edward's company moved to Jersey City, the family moved to [[Deal, New Jersey]], a wealthy community on the shore. Edward was an exceptional violinist and active in sports, including golf, ice skating, and yachting.<ref name=anderson /> In 1920, he received a patent for a \"scientific putter\". A Christian Scientist, he refused to see a doctor and died at age 51.<ref name=levinson />  \n\nNow a wealthy widow, Henrietta moved with her children to [[Newport, Rhode Island]] where she ultimately purchased Seaverage, next to the [[Rough Point]] mansion owned by [[Doris Duke]]. In 1937, she married an Italian aristocrat, Guido Pignatelli (1900\u20131967), [[Prince of Belmonte]], who was only two years older than her daughter.

Sally, after learning that her husband cheated on her with James, is infuriated when Daniel says he's leaving her. In a fit of rage, Sally stabs him in the back and, after a brief pause, calls Cyrus Beene to tell him.\n\nAfter Huck's work with her teeth, Quinn has a tracking device where her tooth used to be. At B-613, she tries to make a deal with Rowan while preparing to inject him with a lethal syringe, but the deal is off once Maya's location is discovered. Quinn manages to remove the tracking device from her mouth, making Huck loses her signal after she flushes it down the toilet. Quinn and Charlie are then called in for a job at the vice president's home.\n\nCyrus wants Sally to let him fix this mess. They set Daniel Douglas up in their bed, making it seem as though he had a [[heart attack]]. Cyrus convinces a traumatized Sally not to let the examining doctor to get too close to the body, after which Cyrus convinces the doctor to forgo the formal examination to make it seem like a heart attack.\n\nRowan is on the move to track down Maya until his team is boxed in by agents working for the [[President of the United States|President]]. Fitz plans to detain him until Olivia's mom is free. He wants to know why he was ordered to shoot down that plane if Maya was already in custody. He also reveals the intimate details of what he does with Olivia. This has Rowan going off on him for never having had to work for anything. He says Fitz isn't in love with his daughter, and states that loving Olivia is his way out. If he's with her, he no longer has to be his father's son. He calls the President a small, insignificant boy.\n\nMellie is ecstatic that Daniel Douglas is dead. Cyrus is less enthused as he engages in some early morning drinking. He spills the details about how the devil came to Sally. He knows that they are the devil in this particular situation. Mellie orders Cyrus to pull it together. That's not going to be easy since James thinks he might be a murderer. He relays his concerns to David Rosen, who isn't interested in helping the man who almost destroyed his career.\n\nOlivia uses the Fitz Phone when she realizes the president is holding her father in the basement of [[the Pentagon]]. She joins the two of them. She knows there was a bomb on the plane. Rowan/Eli/Command made a judgment call to shoot it down to kill 329 people instead of the thousands that would have perished if it detonated over [[London]]. As it turns out, Maya lied. She tricked her husband into killing those passengers. Olivia orders Fitz to have her mom arrested the second she gets off the plane.\n\nRowan is set free to continue doing B-613. As for Maya, her plane never made it to [[Hong Kong]]. It was found in [[Mongolia]] with the entire crew has been murdered. There's no sign of Maya. Olivia believes someone will likely pay for what went down with her father. She tries to warn Jake, but he's only interested in kissing her.\n\nQuinn sneaks away while Charlie is asleep. She returns to the Pope & Associates offices to talk to Huck, and is shocked to hear that he is unrepentant about torturing her. This sends her back to Charlie, and B-613.\n\nCyrus tells James that he's the love of his life, hoping that he won't leave him. James agrees to stay with Cyrus if he's named [[White House Press Secretary]], which Cyrus accepts.\n\nMellie lets Sally know that they are taking care of everything. Sally tries to tell Leo Bergen that she's not going to run for president, but ends up spilling the news that she killed Daniel. Leo is furious that she called the [[White House]] for help. He says, \u201cYou kill somebody\u2026 you call me.\u201d \n\nA woman who worked as a contractor for the [[NSA]] contacts David. She has a recording of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]\u2019s call to Cyrus after killing her husband.\n\nOlivia calls her father. She wants to know if he was trying to protect Olivia from who her mother was. He offers to talk to her about other things at Sunday dinner because she\u2019s never going to get the answers she\u2019s looking for from him. He heads back to work, but Jake is behind his desk, as the new head of B-613. Fitz lets him know via phone that the two of them will make a heck of a team. \n\nMaya calls Olivia but won\u2019t reveal her location. She only tells her daughter that she will see her real soon.

He offers to talk to her about other things at Sunday dinner because she\u2019s never going to get the answers she\u2019s looking for from him. He heads back to work, but Jake is behind his desk, as the new head of B-613. Fitz lets him know via phone that the two of them will make a heck of a team. \n\nMaya calls Olivia but won\u2019t reveal her location. She only tells her daughter that she will see her real soon.

Bukhan.\n\n===Yeouido===\n\n[[Yeouido]] (\uc5ec\uc758\ub3c4) is a large island within Seoul, and the center of Seoul's business district. Its 8.4 square kilometers are home to some 30,988 people. The island is located in the [[Yeongdeungpo-gu]] district of Seoul, and largely corresponds to the precinct of Yeoui-dong. Lying on the south edge of the Han River, it contains the [[National Assembly of South Korea]], the [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]], and many office buildings including the [[63 Building]] and the headquarters of [[LG]], and other [[chaebol]].\n\n==Sudogwon==\n{{main|Sudogwon}}\n\n===Bundang===\n\n[[Bundang]] (\ubd84\ub2f9) is the southernmost district of [[Seongnam]], South Korea. It is considered to be the thriving, beating heart of modern-day Seongnam. In the early 1990s, the Bundang area became a planned community as a response to alleviating the excessive demand for apartments in the similarly affluent, but much older [[Gangnam district]] area. Many of Bundang's early residents actually hailed from the Gangnam area, thereby distinguishing Bundang as an affluent borough in much the same manner as Gangnam. Before this period of expansion however, there was mostly farmland in this area. There are still a few farms in the Bundang area, particularly in the [[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]] area. As the demand for more housing continues, Bundang is expected to continue expanding.\n\n===Ilsan===\n\n[[Ilsan]] (\uc77c\uc0b0) is the name of two districts (West and East) in [[Goyang]], [[Gyeonggi-do]]. It is more organized and planned than the rest of the city, Goyang (Deogyang-gu), and its residents are generally more affluent. Ilsan is located northwest of Seoul. Like other [[satellite cities]] such as Bundang and Pyeongchon, Ilsan was planned in order to alleviate housing shortages in the city of Seoul. Ilsan has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 15 years, usually drawing in younger generations of upper middle-class Koreans.\n\n=== Pangyo ===\n\n[[Pangyo, Seongnam|Pangyo]] (\ud310\uad50) is planned for alleviating the excessive demand for apartments in Gangnam and Bundang. Today it is commonly referred to as Pangyo Techno Valley as it is South Korea's equivalent of Silicon Valley, and hosts many companies ranging from biotech to information technology. Most of its residents are affluent and many have migrated from the nearby areas of Bundang and Gangnam with a growing number of foreign residents because of the density of international companies.\n\n==''Jeonse''==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\n{{main|Jeonse}}\nWhen comparing the rental deposits or ''jeonse'' with the apartment price, the ratio was the lowest for Gangnam apartments. The jeonse to house price ratio is often used as a tool to gauge whether or not the house price is inflated.\n\nThis unique way of renting a house is called ''jeonse''; a renter makes a lump-sum deposit on a rental space instead of paying monthly rent, at anywhere from 50 to 100% of the market value, and gets back the whole deposit when the rent contract ends. The home-owner is free to invest the deposit as wanted, as long as the same amount of money is returned to the tenant at the end of the contract.\n\nSince the ''jeonse'' price reflects the actual demand of people who reside in the area, the gap between rental deposits for ''jeonse'' and the apartment sales price means there might be an [[economic bubble]] in the apartment price.\n\nDepending on the area, ''jeonse'' prices can range as much as 80% of the home's sale price. The expensive Gangnam area's ''jeonse'' is about 30% of the sales price because those properties are so expensive.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/biz/200605/kt2006052317451011910.htm The Korea Times: Southern Seoul Sees Biggest Bubble in Apartment Prices 23 May 2006]\n\n{{Real estate}}\n{{Economy of South Korea}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of South Korea]]\n[[Category:Lists of places in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Real estate by country|Korea, South]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead too short|date=August 2011}}\n\n'''Real estate in South Korea'''\n\n==Seoul==\n===Gangnam===\n\n[[Gangnam (Seoul)|Gangnam]] refers to three ''gu''s (wards) in southern part of Seoul, south of [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], which includes [[Gangnam-gu]], [[Seocho-gu]] and [[Songpa-gu]].
