It has been a [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) sanctioned facility since 2007 and annually hosts the Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Nationals (July 4th Weekend), an NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series Event and the Cavalcade of Stars (May), an NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series Regional Event.  As well as the national events, the facility holds regular local competition throughout the season.\n\nNorwalk Dragway opened to the public in 1963 but lay dormant for much of the first ten years of its existence.  [[Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company|Goodyear]] briefly used the track for tire testing up to 1973 when the track was sold to a joint venture between Wayne Sergeant and Bill Bader.  Sergeant pulled out of the deal the following year and Bader continued as the sole owner. The track was reopened on April 28, 1974.\n\nIn 1981, Norwalk hosted the [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA) World Nationals for the first time.

It has been a [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) sanctioned facility since 2007 and annually hosts the Summit Racing Equipment NHRA Nationals (July 4th Weekend), an NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series Event and the Cavalcade of Stars (May), an NHRA Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series Regional Event.  As well as the national events, the facility holds regular local competition throughout the season.\n\nNorwalk Dragway opened to the public in 1963 but lay dormant for much of the first ten years of its existence.  [[Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company|Goodyear]] briefly used the track for tire testing up to 1973 when the track was sold to a joint venture between Wayne Sergeant and Bill Bader.  Sergeant pulled out of the deal the following year and Bader continued as the sole owner. The track was reopened on April 28, 1974.\n\nIn 1981, Norwalk hosted the [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA) World Nationals for the first time.  It continued to host this event up to the 2006 season and had become the IHRA's flagship drag racing facility by this time.\n\nIn 2007, [[Summit Racing Equipment]] purchased the [[naming rights]] to the facility. The Pontiac Performance NHRA Nationals, held at [[National Trail Raceway]] in [[Hebron, Ohio]] between 1972\u20132006, found its new home at Summit Motorsports Park in 2007.

In producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html |title=Binaural for Beginners (FAQs) |website=Binaural.com |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nListening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterized by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives themself as being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three-dimensional sound.<ref name=\"theverge.com\"/> This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.\n\n==Scientific research and commentary==\n\n===Peer-reviewed articles===\nSeveral [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published. The first, by the physician Nitin Ahuja, is titled \"It Feels Good to Be Measured: clinical role-play, Walker Percy, and the tingles\". It was published in ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'' in 2013 and focused on a conjectural cultural and literary analysis.<ref name=\"Ahuja2013\"/>\n\nAnother article, published in the journal ''Television and New Media'' in November 2014, is by Joceline Andersen, a doctoral student in the Department of Art History and Communication Studies at [[McGill University]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen |title=Joceline Andersen |publisher=McGill University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133621/https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people/phd-students/joceline-andersen |archivedate=5 March 2016 |access-date=29 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> who suggested that ASMR videos comprising whispering 'create an intimate sonic space shared by the listener and the whisperer'. Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Now You've Got the Shiveries |journal=Television & New Media |last=Andersen |first=Joceline |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=683\u2013700 |year=2014 |doi=10.1177/1527476414556184}}</ref>\n\nAnother article, \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state\", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]].

Subjects viewed several ASMR videos with a screen and headphones while inside the MRI scanner. The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that \"the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]\", and suggested that these were similar to \"activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]\".<ref name=\"BioImpacts 2018-09-23\">{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Bioimpacts |first1=Bryson C. |last1=Lochte |first2=Sean A. |last2=Guillory |first3=Craig A.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\". Stafford compared the current status of ASMR with the development of attitudes toward [[synesthesia]], which he said \"for years...was a myth, then in the 1990s people came up with a reliable way of measuring it\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/maria-spends-20-minutes-folding-towels-why-millions-are-mesmerised-by-asmr-videos-7956866.html |title=Maria spends 20 minutes folding towels: why millions are mesmerized by ASMR videos |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Rhodri |last=Marsden |date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons and associations with other phenomena==\n\n===Synesthesia===\n{{main|Synesthesia}}\nIntegral to the subjective experience of ASMR is a localized tingling sensation that many describe as similar to being gently touched, but which is stimulated by watching and listening to video media in the absence of any physical contact with another person.\n\nThese reports have precipitated comparison between ASMR and [[synesthesia]] \u2013 a condition characterized by the excitation of one sensory modality by stimuli that normally exclusively stimulates another, as when the hearing of a specific sound induces the visualization of a distinct color, a type of synesthesia called [[chromesthesia]].

By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html |title=Binaural for Beginners (FAQs) |website=Binaural.com |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nListening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterized by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three-dimensional sound.<ref name=\"theverge.com\"/> This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.\n\n==Scientific research and commentary==\n\n===Peer-reviewed articles===\nSeveral [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published.

Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Now You've Got the Shiveries |journal=Television & New Media |last=Andersen |first=Joceline |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=683\u2013700 |year=2014 |doi=10.1177/1527476414556184}}</ref>\n\nAnother article, \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state\", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]].

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\".

Indeed, at this time, the use of biblical, Christian, or Hebrew names and surnames became very popular, and entered the European lexicon.<ref>John Lehman, Jack Family, Coat of Arms, 2016</ref>\n\nRobert J., a Knight Crusader in 1248 was the first documented use of the surname.<ref>Courtois cabinet, Latin Charters from 1191 to 1249 relating to Crusaders.</ref>  Since then, several personalities who have glorified this surname: Guillaume, secretary of the Duke and auditor of the account in 1413; Thomas, the Archdeacon of Penthievre, the Prior of Pirmil, the Bishop of Leon in 1478, transferred to Dol in 1482, the ambassador of the duke to His Holiness in 1486, who died in 1503, and is interred in his cathedral; Jean, the Canon of Dol and Prior of Lehon; Fran\u00e7ois, Lord of the Ville-Carr\u00e9, and the Provost Marshal in 1577; and Captain of Plo\u00ebrmel, who prospered in Rennes in 1621; Bernard, a Rennes counsellor in 1653.<ref>Heraldrys Institute of Rome, Jacq Nobles, 2016</ref>  The widespread use of surnames was not evident in Europe until the mid- to late- 16th century, and prior usage was restricted to the noble class. It was only in the 17th century that nobles became accustomed to calling themselves by the name of their land with particle \u201cde\u201d rather than their original name or full name. In this way, the commoners found it more \"chic\" to do the same. Officially, there are about 2,500 noble families in France today, for about 120,000 names with particle. Conversely, there are many noble families who have a name without particle, some of which are able to trace their origins back to the Middle Ages. The Kings of France were known as the Capet family, examples being Mountbatten-Windsor, Grimaldi and Romanov among others.\n\n== Spread of Surname Use into the UK and its spelling Variations ==\n\nThe use surnames reached England during the conquest by an army of Norman, Breton, Flemish, and French soldiers under Duke William II of Normandy (William the Conqueror). The names became anglicized following the conquest. Over the centuries the spelling of the Jack surname has changed and developed as the French language became increasingly associated with high culture and status.<ref>Hollister, ed. \"The Effects of the Norman Conquest\", The Impact of the Norman Conquest, P.33.</ref> Several European kings have thus adopted the name with James (or Jacques) of England and Scotland, Jacques of Monaco\u2026 Kings James was coined under the name of Jacobus.<ref>https://24carat.co.uk/frame.php?url=jamesibritaincrowntun.html.</ref> Jack appears in the records spelled as Jacques, Jaques, Jack, Jacks, Jackes, Jakes, Jeeks, Jeke, Jeex, Jaquiss, Jaquez and Jaquis, with spelling variations even occurring in documents referring to the same person. There are several explanations for this situation. Latin, as a language used by educated men, and the language of the Anglo-Saxons both had a profound impact on the spelling and pronunciation of Norman names. On the other hand, the Norman language effected the development of English. As the English language developed from its Germanic roots into Middle English (which was influenced by Norman French) we find a period during which spelling was not standardized but roughly followed phonetic pronunciation. During this time names were spelled a variety of ways depending upon local dialects. Thus the surname, as well as the Anglo-Saxon names, were recorded in many different ways.<ref>Swyrich Corporation, The Most Distinguished Surname Jack,1998</ref>\n\n== Early History ==\n\nNorman surnames like Jack are mistakenly considered French, as Normans, derived from \u201cNorthmen\u201d, were of Viking origin. In 911, Vikings settled in their namesake region, Normandy, in current day France, where their language merged with that of locals to create a distinct French dialect. Throughout this period, England also endured Viking invasions, but the Anglo-Saxons successfully repelled them until 994. When the Danes ruled England, the Saxon royal family lived in Normandy and intermarried with the Duke of Normandy's family. William II, Duke of Normandy, could then claim the English throne when his cousin, Edward the Confessor, the restored Saxon King, died without an heir.\n\nAt the Battle of Hastings, William\u2019s army defeated their rival, King Harold Godwin, who was killed in the engagement. William could then claim the throne as Harold was elected and not a true member of the royal family. Despite the success of the foreign \"conquest,\" English nobles were permitted to retain their land unless they rebelled. Any resisting English elite had their lands confiscated, and some of them fled into exile as a result. William granted lands to his followers and built commanding military strongpoint castles for defense of his realm.<ref>Puryear, Cynthia L., \"The effects of the Norman Conquest on Anglo-Saxon Aristocracy\" (1976).Honors Theses.Paper 711, P.2</ref>  By 1086, more than 92% of English nobles were replaced by William\u2019s followers.<ref>David  C.

At the time of the Doomsday Book in 1086, Nether Silton was recorded as a village with a hall and the tenant-in-chief was the Count of Mortain.<ref>Swyrich Corporation, The Most Distinguished Surname Jack,1998</ref>\n\nThe first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William Jagge, from Cambridgeshire dated 1251, in the \"Chartulary of Ramsey Abbey\", during the reign of King Henry III, who was known as \"The Frenchman\", 1216 \u2013 1272, a witness in the Assize Court Rolls of Cambridgeshire in 1260.<ref>Swyrich Corporation, The Most Distinguished Surname Jack,1998</ref>\n\nKatherine Jeke of Wikington in Stafford married Robert Farnham, Lord of Querndon in 1440. The family later acquired estates at Easby Abbey and Elvington. Of this latter branch, Sir Roger Jaques was Lord Mayor of York in 1639, and knighted by King Charles I. Sir John Jacques was also knighted by King Charles I in 1628. The family branched into Middlesex. Mary, daughter of Thomas Jacques of Leeds, married Robert Gosforth of Northumberland in 1818. The present seat of the family is at Easby Abbey.<ref>Swyrich Corporation, The Most Distinguished Surname Jack,1998</ref>\n\nWe found William Jack was Deacon of the Church of Aberdeen in 1580, Thomas Jack was headmaster of Glasgow's Grammar School in 1574, and Andrew Jack lost his ship off Aberdeen in 1577. The name is more prevalent in Aberdeen in modern times.<ref>Swyrich Corporation, The Most Distinguished Surname Jack,1998</ref>\n\nBefore the usage of surnames became common, differentiating between generations also led to \u2018son of Jack\u2019 becoming Jackson, most notably with President Andrew Jackson of South Carolina. The Jackson family had immigrated from Ireland during the colonial period. Jackson led American forces at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Due to favorable weather conditions, and his overall leadership, Britain suffered one of her worst defeats in their overseas colonial history.

It pitted forces led by [[Brian Boru]], [[High King of Ireland]], against a [[Norsemen|Norse]]-[[Gaelic Ireland|Irish]] alliance comprising the forces of [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]], [[Kingdom of Dublin|King of Dublin]]; [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]], [[List of kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]]; and an external Viking contingent led by [[Sigurd the Stout|Sigurd]], [[Earl of Orkney|of Orkney]]; and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of [[Isle of Man|Mann]]. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. \n\nIt is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed in the battle. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son [[Murchad mac Briain|Murchad]] and his grandson [[Toirdelbach mac Murchada meic Briain|Toirdelbach]]. Leinster king M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain. After the battle, the Vikings and the Kingdom of Dublin were reduced to a secondary power. Brian's family was temporarily eclipsed, and there was no undisputed High King of Ireland until the late 12th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe battle was an important event in Irish history and is recorded in both Irish and Norse chronicles. In Ireland, the battle came to be seen as an event that freed the Irish from foreign domination, and Brian was hailed as a national hero. This view was especially popular during English rule in Ireland. Although the battle has come to be viewed in a more critical light, it still has a hold on the popular imagination.<ref>Downham, Clare.

But the Annals of Ulster say that M\u00e1el Sechnaill and Brian rode together to Dublin, and the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] go so far as to say that it was M\u00e1el Sechnaill who won the day, and completed the rout after the death of Brian.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 185, 191</ref> On the other hand, ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'' (\"The War of the Irish with the Foreigners\"), says that the men of Meath came to the muster with Brian, but \"were not faithful to him\".<ref>Duffy (2013), p. 201</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Cogad'', after his arrival at Dublin, Brian sent his forces north across the river to plunder the area known as ''Fine Gall'', and they torched the country as far as [[Howth]].

It is described in the ''Cogad'' as remarkably loud and bloody. The men of Connacht fought the men of Dublin, and the fighting was so fierce that only 100 Connachtmen and twenty Dublinmen survived. The last casualties occurred at \"Dubgall's Bridge\", which Se\u00e1n Duffy suggests was a bridge over the [[River Tolka]], on the road back to Dublin.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 209\u201310</ref> Brian's son Murchad, at the head of the D\u00e1l gCais army, took on the foreign Vikings and, according to the ''Cogad'', he himself killed 100 of the enemy\u2014fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 210\u201311</ref> The Vikings wore [[Mail (armour)|mail]]; the Irish did not. Yet the Irish gained the advantage, partly through the use of small spears, which they hurled at the enemy, and partly through numerical superiority.<ref>McGettigan (2013), pp. 101\u201302</ref>\n\nThe battle, which had begun at first light, lasted all day. Eventually, the Dublin-Leinster forces broke, and some withdrew towards their ships, while others made for a nearby wood. However, the tide had come in again, cutting off the passage to the wood, but also carrying off the Viking ships. With no way out, they were killed in large numbers, many of them by drowning.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 213\u201314</ref> [[Samuel Haughton]], in 1860, calculated that the tide at Clontarf would have been high at 5:30&nbsp;am and again at 5:55&nbsp;pm, which is consistent with the account in the ''Cogad''.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 215\u201317</ref> It was at this point that Brian's grandson Toirdelbach was killed.

It pitted forces led by [[Brian Boru]], [[High King of Ireland]], against a [[Norsemen|Norse]]-[[Gaelic Ireland|Irish]] alliance comprising the forces of [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]], [[Kingdom of Dublin|King of Dublin]]; [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]], [[List of kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]]; and an external Viking contingent led by [[Sigurd the Stout|Sigurd]], [[Earl of Orkney|of Orkney]]; and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of [[Isle of Man|Mann]]. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. \n\nIt is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed in the battle. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son [[Murchad mac Briain|Murchad]] and his grandson [[Toirdelbach mac Murchada meic Briain|Toirdelbach]]. Leinster king M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain. After the battle, the Vikings and the Kingdom of Dublin were reduced to a secondary power. Brian's family was temporarily eclipsed, and there was no undisputed High King of Ireland until the late 12th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe battle was an important event in Irish history and is recorded in both Irish and Norse chronicles. In Ireland, the battle came to be seen as an event that freed the Irish from foreign domination, and Brian was hailed as a national hero. This view was especially popular during English rule in Ireland. Although the battle has come to be viewed in a more critical light, it still has a hold on the popular imagination.<ref>Downham, Clare.

The last casualties occurred at \"Dubgall's Bridge\", which Se\u00e1n Duffy suggests was a bridge over the [[River Tolka]], on the road back to Dublin.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 209\u201310</ref> Brian's son Murchad, at the head of the D\u00e1l gCais army, took on the foreign Vikings and, according to the ''Cogad'', he himself killed 100 of the enemy\u2014fifty with the sword in his right hand and fifty with the sword in his left.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 210\u201311</ref> The Vikings wore [[Mail (armour)|mail]]; the Irish did not. Yet the Irish gained the advantage, partly through the use of small spears, which they hurled at the enemy, and partly through numerical superiority.<ref>McGettigan (2013), pp. 101\u201302</ref>\n\nThe battle, which had begun at first light, lasted all day. Eventually, the Dublin-Leinster forces broke, and some withdrew towards their ships, while others made for a nearby wood. However, the tide had come in again, cutting off the passage to the wood, but also carrying off the Viking ships. With no way out, they were killed in large numbers, many of them by drowning.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 213\u201314</ref> [[Samuel Haughton]], in 1860, calculated that the tide at Clontarf would have been high at 5:30&nbsp;am and again at 5:55&nbsp;pm, which is consistent with the account in the ''Cogad''.<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 215\u201317</ref> It was at this point that Brian's grandson Toirdelbach was killed. He pursued the enemy into the sea, but was hit by a wave and thrown up against the weir, and drowned.<ref name=duffy218>Duffy (2013), p. 218</ref> Murchad killed Sigurd, the earl of Orkney, but shortly afterwards he himself was killed.<ref name=duffy218/> Brian was in his tent praying when Brodir found him, and killed him. Brodir himself was then killed,<ref>Duffy (2013), pp. 219\u201320</ref> possibly by [[Ulf the Quarrelsome]].\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Vikings at Clontarf re-enactment.png|thumb|Viking re-enactors from all over the world at the Battle of Clontarf millennium commemoration in [[Saint Anne's Park]], Dublin (lining up before charging at the opposition). April 19th, 2014.]]\nBrian's body was brought to [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], north of Dublin. There it was met by the [[coarb]] of Patrick, the traditional head of the church in Ireland, who brought the body back with him to [[Armagh]], where it was interred after twelve days of mourning. Along with Brian were the body of Murchad and the heads of Conaing, Brian's nephew, and Mothla, King of the D\u00e9isi Muman.<ref>McGettigan (2013), pp. 109\u201310</ref> M\u00e1el Sechnaill was restored as High King of Ireland, and remained secure in his position until his death in 1022.<ref>McGettigan (2013), p. 111</ref>\n\nThough the Annals imply that life was not much changed after the death of Brian Boru, it created a succession crisis, as Brian's son and heir Murchad had died as well. Brian had two remaining sons who could challenge for the kingship: [[Donnchad mac Briain]], his son with [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada|Gormflaith]] and [[Tadc mac Briain]], his son with Echrad. According to the annals, Donnchad rallied the forces of the D\u00e1l gCais at Clontarf and led them home to Cenn Corad.<ref name=\"Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf\">{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Se\u00e1n|title=Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf|date=2013|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|location=Dublin|isbn=9780717157785|page=249}}</ref>\n\nWithin weeks the D\u00e1l gCais, under the new leadership of Donnchad, were battling their old masters the [[E\u00f3ganachta|E\u00f3ganacht]] Raithlind. Tadc initially joined his brother against the E\u00f3ganacht, but would eventually be killed in 1023 at the order of Donnchad.<ref name=\"Brian Boru and the Battle of Clontarf\" />\n\nSigtrygg remained King of Dublin until 1036, and was apparently secure enough to go on pilgrimage to Rome in 1028.<ref>McGettigan (2013), p. 118</ref> However, after Clontarf, Dublin had been reduced to a lesser power. In 1052, [[Diarmait mac M\u00e1el na mB\u00f3]], King of Leinster, captured Dublin and ''Fine Gall'', for the first time asserting Irish overlordship over the Norse of Ireland.<ref>Duffy (2013), p. 254</ref>\n\n==Historical debate==\nIn modern times there has been a long-running debate among historians, which is now 250 years old, about Ireland's Viking age and the Battle of Clontarf. The standard view, and the \"popular\" view, is that the battle ended a war between the Irish and Vikings by which Brian Boru broke Viking power in Ireland. However [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] historians see it as an Irish civil war in which Brian Boru's Munster and its allies defeated Leinster and Dublin, and that there were Vikings fighting on both sides.<ref name=RTE2018-01-24a>{{cite web |url = https://www.rte.ie/news/newslens/2018/0124/935551-battle-of-clontarf/ |title = Network science shines new light on Battle of Clontarf |publisher = RTE |date =24 January 2018  |accessdate =24 January 2018 |quote= }}</ref><ref name=IT2018-01-24a>{{cite news |url = https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/battle-of-clontarf-it-s-a-mathematical-question-1.3365898 |author = Kevin O'Sullivan |authorlink = Kevin O'Sullivan (journalist)|title = Battle of Clontarf: It's a mathematical question |newspaper = The Irish Times |date =24 January 2018  |accessdate =24 January 2018 |quote= Centuries-old debate continues as social media analysis used to explore Viking-Irish strife ...
