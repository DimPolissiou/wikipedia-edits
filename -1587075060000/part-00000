The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by [[vaudeville]] comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film]] starring the original lead of the stage musical, [[Zero Mostel]].\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway===\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\n\nThe show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198 \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum\"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996),  Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p. 198</ref>\n\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.\n\nIt was directed by [[George Abbott]] and produced by [[Hal Prince]], with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\n\nThe show won several [[Tony Award]]s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n===London===\nThe show was presented twice in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,<ref>[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm \"Listing, 1963 production\"] Guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html \"Listing, 1986 production\"] Thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref> and starred [[Frankie Howerd]] as Pseudolus and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus in both. In the 1963 production, [[Kenneth Connor]] appeared as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as [[Senex]], [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus, and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus. In the 1986 revival, [[Patrick Cargill]] was Senex with [[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Hysterium and [[Derek Royle]] as Erronius.\n\nIn 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]], starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).<ref>Inverne, James.

[[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by [[Michael Hordern]].

They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.<ref name=phil/>\n\nThe musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the [[St. James Theatre]] on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred [[Nathan Lane]] as Pseudolus (replaced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and later by [[David Alan Grier]]), [[Mark Linn-Baker]] as Hysterium, [[Ernie Sabella]] as Lycus, [[Jim Stanek]] as Hero, [[Lewis J. Stadlen]] as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]], with choreography by [[Rob Marshall]]. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/production/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-forum-st-james-theatre-vault-0000004175# \" 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum' Broadway 1996\",].

In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''[[Pseudolus]]''': A Roman slave, owned by Hero, who seeks to win freedom by helping Hero win the heart of Philia.  The name ''Pseudolus''  means \"Faker\". While originally written as a male role, it has been performed by female actors as well.\n*'''Hero''': Young son of Senex who falls in love with the virgin, Philia.\n*'''Philia''': (Greek for \"love\") A virgin in the house of Marcus Lycus, and Hero's love interest. Her name is also a homophone of the Latin word \"Filia,\" which means daughter. This foreshadows her status as the daughter of Erronius.\n* '''Hysterium''': (Latin for \"Hysterical\", or \"Anxious\", the suffix \"-um\" makes the name neuter, and the character's gender is often mistaken throughout the piece) The chief slave in the house of Senex.\n*'''[[Senex]]''': (Latin for \"old man\") A henpecked, sardonic [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senator]] living in a less fashionable suburb of Rome.\n*'''Domina''': (Latin for \"mistress\") The wife of Senex. A manipulative, shrewish woman loathed by her husband.\n*'''Marcus Lycus''': A purveyor of courtesans, who operates from the house to the left of Senex. (Name based on Lycus, the prostitute in [[Plautus]]'s ''Poenulus''.)\n*'''[[Miles Gloriosus]]''': (Latin for \"boastful soldier,\" the archetype of the braggart soldier in Roman comedies) A captain in the Roman army to whom Marcus Lycus has promised Philia.\n*'''Erronius''': (Latin for \"wandering\") Senex's elderly neighbor in the house to the right. He has spent the past twenty years searching for his two children, kidnapped in infancy by pirates.\n*'''Gymnasia''': (Greek for \"Athletic\", with the connotation of nakedness) A courtesan from the house of Lycus with whom Pseudolus falls in love.\n*'''Tintinabula''': (Latin for \"Bells\") A jingling, bell-wearing courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Vibrata''': (Latin for \"Vibrant\") A wild, vibrant courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Geminae''': (Latin for \"Twins\") Twin courtesans in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Panacea''': (Greek for \"Cure All\") A courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Proteans''': Choristers who play multiple roles (slaves, citizens, soldiers, and eunuchs). They accompany Pseudolus in \"Comedy Tonight\". On Broadway, three people played all of these roles.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by [[vaudeville]] comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film]] starring the original lead of the stage musical, [[Zero Mostel]].\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway===\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\n\nThe show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198 \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum\"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996),  Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p. 198</ref>\n\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.\n\nIt was directed by [[George Abbott]] and produced by [[Hal Prince]], with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\n\nThe show won several [[Tony Award]]s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n===London===\nThe show was presented twice in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,<ref>[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm \"Listing, 1963 production\"] Guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html \"Listing, 1986 production\"] Thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref> and starred [[Frankie Howerd]] as Pseudolus and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus in both. In the 1963 production, [[Kenneth Connor]] appeared as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as [[Senex]], [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus, and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus. In the 1986 revival, [[Patrick Cargill]] was Senex with [[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Hysterium and [[Derek Royle]] as Erronius.\n\nIn 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]], starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).<ref>Inverne, James.

[[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by [[Michael Hordern]].

In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''[[Pseudolus]]''': A Roman slave, owned by Hero, who seeks to win freedom by helping Hero win the heart of Philia.  The name ''Pseudolus''  means \"Faker\". While originally written as a male role, it has been performed by female actors as well.\n*'''Hero''': Young son of Senex who falls in love with the virgin, Philia.\n*'''Philia''': (Greek for \"love\") A virgin in the house of Marcus Lycus, and Hero's love interest. Her name is also a homophone of the Latin word \"Filia,\" which means daughter. This foreshadows her status as the daughter of Erronius.\n* '''Hysterium''': (Latin for \"Hysterical\", or \"Anxious\", the suffix \"-um\" makes the name neuter, and the character's gender is often mistaken throughout the piece) The chief slave in the house of Senex.\n*'''[[Senex]]''': (Latin for \"old man\") A henpecked, sardonic [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senator]] living in a less fashionable suburb of Rome.\n*'''Domina''': (Latin for \"mistress\") The wife of Senex. A manipulative, shrewish woman loathed by her husband.\n*'''Marcus Lycus''': A purveyor of courtesans, who operates from the house to the left of Senex. (Name based on Lycus, the prostitute in [[Plautus]]'s ''Poenulus''.)\n*'''[[Miles Gloriosus]]''': (Latin for \"boastful soldier,\" the archetype of the braggart soldier in Roman comedies) A captain in the Roman army to whom Marcus Lycus has promised Philia.\n*'''Erronius''': (Latin for \"wandering\") Senex's elderly neighbor in the house to the right. He has spent the past twenty years searching for his two children, kidnapped in infancy by pirates.\n*'''Gymnasia''': (Greek for \"Athletic\", with the connotation of nakedness) A courtesan from the house of Lycus with whom Pseudolus falls in love.\n*'''Tintinabula''': (Latin for \"Bells\") A jingling, bell-wearing courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Vibrata''': (Latin for \"Vibrant\") A wild, vibrant courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Geminae''': (Latin for \"Twins\") Twin courtesans in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Panacea''': (Greek for \"Cure All\") A courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Proteans''': Choristers who play multiple roles (slaves, citizens, soldiers, and eunuchs). They accompany Pseudolus in \"Comedy Tonight\". On Broadway, three people played all of these roles.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007).

Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

Faculty members act as facilitators, assisting students in acquiring the communication and information access skills they will need to function as productive citizens in an increasingly technological world. Students are taught to be prudent risk-takers and creative problem solvers in a global society. Achievement of these goals will result in their becoming socially and ethically responsible adults.\"\n\nA broader knowledge base and appreciation developed through exploring the interconnections among science, mathematics and the humanities elicits higher level thinking skills. To foster this development, the High Technology High School will offer opportunities for the students to explore not only these connections, but also a wide range of subjects and interests.\n\n==Academics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}\nHigh Technology offers a full high school education, with emphasis on math, science, and technology. Students take college courses during their junior and senior years, and seniors are required to take a mentorship course for one semester.\n\nClass scheduling works around \"block\" scheduling. All classes are 69 minutes long, and there are 5 periods in a day. All students eat lunch at the same time, between 11:15 and 12:00 PM. Most classes are held three times a week. Physical Education is held two periods per week. AP science classes have \"double labs\" which are two periods (138 minutes) long, while AP Calculus classes meet one extra period per week. The foreign languages taught at High Technology High School are Latin, French, and Spanish. Junior and senior technology electives - Project Lead the Way courses (Digital Electronics, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Biological Engineering & Environmental Sustainability, Computer Science & Software Engineering, and Engineering Design and Development) - are held twice a week for three periods (210 minutes).\n\nBoth the faculty and the student body have found this schedule to be to their advantage. For students it means more time to get things done in class and more time to do homework. For the teachers it means longer uninterrupted blocks of time to instruct students.\n\nHigh Technology seniors participate in a mentorship one day a week for a full semester. Students work side by side with an engineer, scientist, or researcher, doing real-time research in a technological field. At the conclusion of the mentorship, each student delivers a multimedia presentation in a colloquium of peers and mentors. This summarizes all the formal and informal learning at the conclusion of the senior year.\n\nMany of the courses offered at HTHS are taught by teams of teachers with expertise in their respective fields. The sci-tech program, humanities program, and the sophomore technologies program integrate multiple disciplines to enhance subject matter for students. Students work in teams which are assessed by exhibition as well as traditional methods.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n*''[[Business Insider]]'' ranked High Technology High School at the top of its 2014 list of the \"25 best public high school in the United States\".<ref>Stanger, Melissa; and Robinson, Melia.

Faculty members act as facilitators, assisting students in acquiring the communication and information access skills they will need to function as productive citizens in an increasingly technological world. Students are taught to be prudent risk-takers and creative problem solvers in a global society. Achievement of these goals will result in their becoming socially and ethically responsible adults.\"\n\nA broader knowledge base and appreciation developed through exploring the interconnections among science, mathematics and the humanities elicits higher level thinking skills. To foster this development, the High Technology High School will offer opportunities for the students to explore not only these connections, but also a wide range of subjects and interests.\n\n==Academics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}\nHigh Technology offers a full high school education, with emphasis on math, science, and technology. Students take college courses during their junior and senior years, and seniors are required to take a mentorship course for one semester.\n\nClass scheduling works around \"block\" scheduling. All classes are 69 minutes long, and there are 5 periods in a day. All students eat lunch at the same time, between 11:15 and 12:00 PM. Most classes are held three times a week. Physical Education is held two periods per week. AP science classes have \"double labs\" which are two periods (138 minutes) long, while AP Calculus classes meet one extra period per week. The foreign languages taught at High Technology High School are Latin, French, and Spanish. Junior and senior technology electives - Project Lead the Way courses (Digital Electronics, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Biological Engineering & Environmental Sustainability, Computer Science & Software Engineering, and Engineering Design and Development) - are held twice a week for three periods (210 minutes).\n\nBoth the faculty and the student body have found this schedule to be to their advantage. For students it means more time to get things done in class and more time to do homework. For the teachers it means longer uninterrupted blocks of time to instruct students.\n\nHigh Technology seniors participate in a mentorship one day a week for a full semester. Students work side by side with an engineer, scientist, or researcher, doing real-time research in a technological field. At the conclusion of the mentorship, each student delivers a multimedia presentation in a colloquium of peers and mentors. This summarizes all the formal and informal learning at the conclusion of the senior year.\n\nMany of the courses offered at HTHS are taught by teams of teachers with expertise in their respective fields. The sci-tech program, humanities program, and the sophomore technologies program integrate multiple disciplines to enhance subject matter for students. Students work in teams which are assessed by exhibition as well as traditional methods.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n*''[[Business Insider]]'' ranked High Technology High School at the top of its 2014 list of the \"25 best public high school in the United States\".<ref>Stanger, Melissa; and Robinson, Melia.
