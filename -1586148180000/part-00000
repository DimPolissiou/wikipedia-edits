It is the premier professional men's basketball league in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=nbl-hq>[http://www.nbl.com.au/nbl-hq NBL HQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626103747/http://www.nbl.com.au/nbl-hq |date=26 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NBL Logo 2009-2010.png|thumb|right|200px|The logo used by the NBL from 2009 to 2015.]] -->\n\nIn August 1979, the [[1979 NBL season|inaugural season]] of the NBL commenced, playing in the winter season (April\u2013September) which it did so until the completion of the [[1998 NBL season|1998 season]], the league's twentieth season. The [[1998\u201399 NBL season|1998\u201399 season]], which began only months later, was the first to be played during the summer season (October\u2013April). The shift, which is currently used by the league, was an attempt to avoid competing directly against [[Football in Australia|Australia's various winter season football codes]].\n\nThe NBL experienced its \"golden age\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s,<ref>[https://blogs.crikey.com.au/sports/2008/12/10/the-decline-of-the-nbl/ The decline of the NBL], [[Crikey]], December 10, 2008</ref> but its popularity, media attention, attendance and corporate support deteriorated and plateaued in the decade afterward.\n\nA second Melbourne club, the [[South Dragons]], entered the league in the [[2006\u201307 NBL season|2006\u201307 season]], but was short lived, soon folding 3 years later after the [[2008\u201309 NBL season|2008\u201309 season]] in which they were premiers. In the 2006\u201307 season, the NBL became the first Australasian sporting league to field a team from Asia with the [[Singapore Slingers]] playing. The [[Gold Coast Blaze]] also joined the competition in the [[2007\u201308 NBL season|2007\u201308 season]]. In 2007, Australian NBA player [[Andrew Bogut]] suggested the NBL try to adopt a model similar to the Australian Football League (AFL) whereby there are the same 10 or 15 teams over a 10-year period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adopt AFL model|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/old-sport-pages/adopt-afl-model/story-e6frfgbf-1111113718503|work=HeraldSun.com|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nblcage.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Melbourne Tigers]] and [[Gold Coast Blaze]] at [[State Netball and Hockey Centre]]]]\n \nA turbulent period during 2008 and 2009 saw the league lose teams from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Singapore.\n\nThe [[2009\u201310 NBL season|2009\u201310 season]] earmarked as the season in which the NBL would begin its revamping, much like the old [[National Soccer League]] which became the eight team [[A-League]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/aleague/history|work=footballaustralia.com.au|accessdate=15 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022145515/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/aleague/history|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The NBL returned to [[free-to-air]] television in Australia for the first time in three years with [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] broadcasting 2\u20133 games a week.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 NBL season|2010\u201311 season]] saw the return of the [[Sydney Kings]] after the club was purchased for {{AUD}}20,000 on 31 July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kings return on the cards|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/other-sports/basketball/kings-return-on-the-cards/story-e6frf3f3-1111117076589|work=foxsports.com.au|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the NBL had a de-merger from [[Basketball Australia]].<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1qc1ht5gytmew1c6r352rhpr4k Basketball Australia and National Basketball League to move forward with de-merger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026154637/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1qc1ht5gytmew1c6r352rhpr4k |date=26 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/basketball/the-national-basketball-league-will-relaunch-its-own-competition/story-fni2u9cl-1226676484238 The National Basketball League will relaunch its own competition]</ref>\n\nCrowds improved for the [[2013\u201314 NBL season]], recording the highest cumulative crowd attendance figures for the past five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/q6ujg582svk91sq2lkcg7cs0c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311195933/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/q6ujg582svk91sq2lkcg7cs0c |archivedate=11 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter numerous teams folding and a plummeting public profile property developer Larry Kestelman purchased a 51% portion of the league.

In addition the Asian/Oceania born player rule, introduced for the 2016\u201317 season, allows for clubs to recruit players born in countries such as [[India]], [[Guam]] and [[Japan]] who would not count as imports under NBL rules.<ref>https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/brisbane-bullets-sign-japanese-star-makoto-hiejima-for-the-upcoming-nbl-season/news-story/c8465e9ca1104cd442c45497239cecb5</ref>\n\nThe growth of Basketball in Asia over recent years and the overall strength and standard of Australian Basketball should ensure the sustainability of the league for many years provided Asian players continue to strive to compete in the NBL and Asian basketball fans are able to follow the league.

From 1985\u20131987, the Bullets and 36ers were the two dominant teams in the league and the two clubs met in the [[1986 NBL Finals|1986 NBL Grand Final]], the first NBL GF to be played over a 3-game series. An Australian indoor sports attendance record of around 11,000 saw the first game of the 1986 series played at the [[Brisbane Entertainment Centre]] with Adelaide, who had a 24\u20132 record for the [[1986 NBL season|season]], winning 122\u2013119 in overtime. Brisbane then handed Adelaide its only home loss of 1986 (the 36ers had gone 13\u20130 at the [[Apollo Stadium]]) when they won Game 2 104\u201383 before Adelaide won its first NBL title with a 113\u201391 win at Apollo in Game 3. The teams were evenly matched at the time with players such as Al Green, Mark Davis, Bill Jones, Peter Ali, [[Darryl Pearce]], [[Mike McKay (basketball)|Mike McKay]] and Dwayne Nelson (Adelaide) against Brisbane's star import [[Leroy Loggins]], captain [[Larry Sengstock]], guard [[Ron Radliff]], forwards [[Danny Morseu]], Robert Sibley and Chris McGraw, centre [[John Dorge]] and (in 1985 and 1986) Cal Bruton. Loggins was the NBL MVP in 1986 and 1987 (and player of the match in the 1985 GF) while Mark Davis was the Grand Final MVP in 1986 and shared the league MVP award with Loggins in [[1987 NBL season|1987]].\n\nThe Rivalry between the two clubs again reached fever pitch in the mid-1990s when Bullets guard [[Shane Heal]] earned the ire of the Adelaide crowd during Game 3 of the [[1994 NBL season|1994 Elimination final]] series when he gave the crowd at the [[Clipsal Powerhouse]] a 'double bird'. Heal, who had scored 61 points in the last regular season game before scoring 42 points in Game 1 to lead Brisbane to a 116\u2013105 home win over the 36ers, had not actually managed to score a point before half time in Game 2 which the 36ers had won 99\u201391 before also winning Game 3 101\u201384. Heal, along with former 36er [[Mark Bradtke]] who had left under acrimonious circumstances at the end of [[1992 NBL season|1992]] to join the Melbourne Tigers, became public enemy #1 to the 36ers crowd following the incident.\n\nWith the Bullets returning to the NBL in 2016, the rivalry has continued with Adelaide defeating the Bullets in their first encounter at home, the Bullets returning the favour with an away win in Adelaide, while a week later Adelaide spoiled the Bullets regular season return to the Entertainment Centre for the first time since 1997 with a resounding 101\u201383 win.<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/livestats/?matchid=314733&page=strip Bullets vs 36ers - NBL Round 8, 2016-17]</ref>\n\n'''''[[Adelaide 36ers]] vs [[Melbourne United]]'''''\n\nApart from the normal South Australian and Victorian rivalry, the 36ers vs United (formerly Tigers) rivalry started at the end of the 1992 season when 36ers centre [[Mark Bradtke]] joined Spanish club [[CB Murcia|Juver Murcia]] following the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain for a short stint. Before he left he signed an agreement with the 36ers stating that he would finish his one-year contract with the club should he return within a certain time. Upon his return to Australia, Bradtke stated his intention not to return to the 36ers with the Tigers rumoured to be actively chasing him. After protracted negotiations with 36ers management that led to the club being prepared to buy out his remaining contract, the NBL stepped in and vetoed the buy out, effectively letting Bradtke leave for Melbourne without the 36ers receiving any compensation for the remainder of his contract with the club. When Bradtke returned to Adelaide with the Tigers on 4 July 1993 he was soundly booed whenever he touched the ball by the 8,000 strong crowd at the [[Clipsal Powerhouse]]. The booing of Bradtke and the [[Andrew Gaze]] led Tigers continued for a number of seasons.\n\nA new rivalry has emerged with [[Julius Hodge]], a former 36er, returning to the NBL in November 2009, signing with the Melbourne Tigers. Hodge was a star in Adelaide when he joined the 36ers mid-season the previous two years, however issues relating to alleged missed payments caused him to walk out on the club in early January 2009 on bad terms.<ref name=\"heraldsun-hodge\">{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/old-sport-pages/no-show-hodge-quits-36ers/story-e6frfgbf-1111118512303 | title=No-show Julius Hodge quits Adelaide 36ers | work=HeraldSun.com | date=8 January 2009 | accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHodge returned to his old home court for the first time on 5 December 2009 in a Tigers overtime victory. After being heckled and taunted all night in a quiet game by his standards, Hodge caused more controversy when he stamped and spat on the [[Brett Maher (basketball)|Brett Maher]] signature on the centre of the Brett Maher Court following his new club's win. He was booed off aggressively and loudly by the Adelaide fans and needed security to escort him out of the stadium.<ref name=\"abc-hodge\">{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-06/hodge-sticks-the-boot-into-adelaide/1171266 | title=Hodge sticks the boot into Adelaide | work=ABC.net.au | date=6 December 2009 | accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''''[[Adelaide 36ers]] vs [[Perth Wildcats]]'''''\n\nBoth teams were perennial championship contenders in the late 1980s and early 90s and had several marquee players with excellent match-ups, the three most notable all involving American imports: [[Al Green (basketball)|Al Green]] (Adelaide) vs [[Cal Bruton]] (Perth), [[Mark Davis (basketball, born 1960)|Mark Davis]] (Adelaide) vs [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] (Perth) and [[Bill Jones (basketball, born 1966)|Bill Jones]] (Adelaide) vs [[Tiny Pinder]] (Perth). Games during this era were rarely blowouts and helped to fuel the rivalry. Adelaide won the 1986 NBL Championship over the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and Bruton, who moved from Brisbane to be player-coach of Perth in 1987, built a team specifically to beat the reigning champions. Despite the long time rivalry between the two clubs, and the two teams having played numerous semi-final series against each other with the first being in that [[1987 NBL season|1987 season]], they did not face each other in a grand final series until the [[2013\u201314 NBL season|2013\u201314 season]], which was won by the Perth Wildcats. the Wildcats have won each semi-finals series played between the two (1987, [[1989 NBL Finals|1989]] and [[1995 NBL season|1995]]).\n\nThe 1995 series proved to be one of the most volatile and controversial due to an incident between 36ers forward Chris Blakemore and Perth's [[Martin Cattalini]] in Game 1 in Adelaide. Under instructions from coach [[Mike Dunlap]] to basically belt the next Perth player to go through the key, Blakemore back handed Cattalini, giving the Wildcats forward a large cut on his mouth that required 15 stitches. Blakemore was suspended for Game 2 in [[Perth Entertainment Centre|Perth]] as the Wildcats swept the 36ers 2\u20130 before going on to defeat the defending champion [[North Melbourne Giants]] (who had swept Adelaide in 1994) 2\u20131 in the Grand Final. In an ironic twist, Cattalini would join the 36ers in 1996 and later went on to win two championships with the club (plus another with Perth), while Blakemore, the NBL's Rookie of the year in [[1993 NBL season|1993]] and its Most Improved Player award winner in [[1994 NBL season|1994]], as well as playing for the [[Australian boomers|Australian Boomers]] in 1995, joined the [[Canberra Cannons]] in 1996 and his career went downhill from there with his NBL career ending at the end of [[1997 NBL season|1997]] after just two seasons with the Cannons.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKnxKzpuxsU&t=1s Title Town - Adelaide 36ers in the 1990s]</ref>\n\nAs the mainstay players began to slow with age and retire, the intensity of this rivalry has declined. The two clubs remain the most successful in the NBL with four championships for Adelaide and nine for Perth and are first and second on the all-time wins list (709 wins for Perth, 670 wins for Adelaide as of November 15, 2019) and have also matched up on more occasions (134 times total; Perth leading all time between the two 73 \u2013 61) than any other two teams in the NBL (as of November 15, 2019). The rivalry continues into the [[2012\u201313 NBL season|2012\u201313 season]] with the 36ers beating the Wildcats in back to back games in rounds 6 and 7, including the opening game at Perth's new home, the [[Perth Arena]], in front of a then record Wildcats crowd of 11,562.\n\nThe Wildcats and 36ers dominated the [[2013\u201314 NBL season]], finishing first and second respectively during the regular round. After the three previous semi-final meetings, they then faced off in their first ever Grand Final series which saw the Wildcats emerge with their record 6th NBL championship with a 2\u20131 series win. This was one of the most anticipated series in NBL history, not only given the two clubs' long-standing rivalry, but also due to the post-game on court 'brawl' which took place following their Round 18 clash in Perth earlier in the season.\n\nAdelaide and Perth play for the Cattalini Cup named for Perth born Martin Cattalini who won two championships with each club. In each game, the game MVP is awarded with the [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]] Medal named for Adelaide born centre Paul Rogers who made his NBL debut for the 36ers in 1992 and later joined Perth, winning 2 championships and the NBL MVP award in 2000 while with the Wildcats.\n\n'''''[[Cairns Taipans]] vs [[Townsville Crocodiles]]'''''\n\nA local derby-style rivalry nicknamed \"Reptile Rumble\" has developed to determine which is the dominant North Queensland team. The Cairns-Townsville basketball rivalry would have to be one of the longest and most passionate in the NBL.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Both teams generally attract a close to capacity crowd anywhere from 4000+ at their home games. Each team and their supporters and mascots generally boo and taunt their visiting rivals. The rivalry has been in existent for over 10 years and almost came to a near end when the Cairns Taipans were on the verge of extinction due to financial issues.\n\nThe rivalry between the two North Queensland based clubs is currently extinct due to the Crocodiles folding at the end of the [[2015\u201316 NBL season]].\n\n'''''[[Illawarra Hawks]] vs [[Sydney Kings]]'''''\n\nHawks fans consider the Sydney Kings to be their most fierce rival. Many Hawks players have moved to the Kings including two former Rookie of the Year winners and a two-time Olympian. In the absence of the Kings, the [[Sydney Spirit]] took the role of rival, but this felt fake to some Hawks faithful. The Hawks took bragging rights after the [[2000\u201301 NBL season|2000\u201301 season]] when they became the first team from New South Wales to qualify for the NBL finals, which they won against Townsville. Sydney then took the ascendency when they won three championships in a row, including a clean sweep of the Hawks.\n\n'''''[[New Zealand Breakers]] vs [[Perth Wildcats]]'''''\n\nThe Breakers and Wildcats have arguably been the league's current strongest teams, and have been fairly evenly matched. Between them, they have won every year's league from 2009\u201310 to 2016\u201317, and met in the final in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 (both won by the Breakers) and 2015\u201316 (won by the Wildcats). Both teams have similarities in that they have to travel great distances to play any other NBL team. These two factors have combined to make a \"derby of distance\" between the NBL's farthest-flung members. The rivalry may have its origins in a scrap between players from each side after a game in 2004.<ref>Brown, Michael \"[http://m.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10875436 Basketball: Inside the Breakers-Wildcat rivalry]\", ''New Zealand Herald'', 5 April 2013.

Currently, teams are limited to having three imports (i.e., non-Australasians) on the roster at any one time; league initiatives in recent years have added two roster slots that may be filled by imports without counting against the three-import limit. Some of these players have moved to Australia permanently and become Australian citizens; a few including [[Cal Bruton]], [[Mark Davis (basketball, born 1960)|Mark Davis]], [[Leroy Loggins]] and [[Ricky Grace]] have even played for the Australian national team (under a [[FIBA]] rule that allows one naturalised player to compete for a national team).\n\nThe NBL's salary cap for the 2006\u201307 season was {{AUD}}776,000, and increased to {{AUD}}810,000 for the 2007\u201308 season; the cap rose for two consecutive years due to the continued growth of the league. The salary cap rose {{AUD}}1,000,000 for the 2009\u201310 season. The cap remains at {{AUD}}1,000,000 for the 2012\u201313 season.<ref name=\"nbl-salarycap\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nbl.com.au/salary-cap-player-points | title=Salary Cap/Player Points | work=NBL.com.au | accessdate=5 April 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211031456/http://www.nbl.com.au/salary-cap-player-points | archivedate=11 February 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the salary cap was changed from a {{AUD}}1,000,000 \u2018hard cap\u2019 to a {{AUD}}1,100,000 \u2018soft cap\u2019. Teams may exceed the soft cap provided that they pay a salary equalisation subsidy based on the extent to which they have exceeded the cap. In addition, player values for purposes of the salary cap are not based on the salary submitted to the league, but are determined by a special NBL panel. The cap regulations also mandate that teams distribute their salaries so that at least one group of five players has a collective cap value of no more than {{AUD}}400,000. Both cap numbers (the soft cap and the 5-player aggregate cap) have increased since then, based on average league salaries.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/nbl-announces-changes-to-player-contract-salary-rules/ |title=NBL announces changes to player contract & salary rules |publisher=National Basketball League |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 2014, to help attract high-calibre imports or offer financial incentive for local stars considering overseas opportunities, the NBL introduced a marquee player rule, in which a team can nominate one player whose salary is paid outside the cap, with a 25% Marquee Player levy applied to any payment made above the salary cap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/lkin9ku730qr138bw2cx4l6iz |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084347/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/lkin9ku730qr138bw2cx4l6iz |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1lq35tllwbh751od46t481bey9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084204/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1lq35tllwbh751od46t481bey9 |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2016\u201317 season, the value was modified so that if the marquee player is a \"non-restricted\" player (explained below), only the first $150,000 of that player's salary will be counted toward that team's salary cap.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\"/>\n\nNBL legend Andrew Gaze has pointed to these changes being instrumental to the improvement of NBL and its Australian players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiehoopla.com/andrew-gaze-nbl-podcast|title=Aussie NBL players will have to \"get better\" according to Andrew Gaze|website=www.aussiehoopla.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref>\n\nAlso effective in 2016\u201317, the number of import roster slots was increased from two to three, and each team was allowed (but not required) to have one player from a [[FIBA Asia]] or [[FIBA Oceania]] country other than Australia or New Zealand on its roster who would not be counted against the import limit. Since then, the NBL has used the term \"non-restricted\" to describe all players signed as locals, including Asian/Oceanian players signed under the regional initiative.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\"/> With this change, many of the best Asian-born players were expected to seek NBL contracts, as teams can now recruit them and play them as locals.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/japans-makoto-hiejima-signs-with-brisbane-bullets-under-nbls-asian-player-rule/news-story/5e6c5185d1cfee581db2eddca2bca05b</ref>\n\n==== Next Stars Program ====\n\nMost recently, the NBL announced the \"Next Stars\" initiative on 2 March 2018, effective with the league's 2018\u201319 season. The scheme is designed to provide young elite overseas players, mainly Americans (who are currently [[Eligibility for the NBA draft|barred from the NBA draft]] until one year out of secondary school), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball, with a professional option immediately out of secondary school. Each team will receive one additional import roster slot intended to provide a \"Next Star\" slot. Players who will be part of the scheme will be selected by a special NBL panel and, should they accept the league's offer, be contracted directly by the NBL and placed into an allocation pool to be distributed among the league's teams. The chosen players will receive a salary of {{AUD}}100,000, as well as a car, apartment, and flights home during league breaks. The scheme will be funded for the first season by the NBL, meaning that \"Next Star\" players will not count against the salary cap. Finally, under current rules, the NBA allows its teams to spend up to {{USD}}700,000 to buy players out of professional contracts in non-North American leagues; should a \"Next Star\" be bought out by an NBA team (or by a team in another overseas league), the buyout amount will be split between the team and the NBL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22594625/how-australian-basketball-targeting-one-dones-nba-draft |title=How Australian basketball is targeting one-and-dones |first=Jonathan |last=Givony |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=1 March 2018 |accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/nbl-launches-next-stars-program-targeting-potential-oneanddone-athletes/news-story/b448cd87c44396ace425de70777954be |title=NBL launches \u2018Next Stars\u2019 program, targeting potential one-and-done athletes |first=Olgun |last=Uluc |publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)]] |date=2 March 2018 |accessdate=5 March 2018}}\n</ref> The first player signed to a Next Star contract was American [[Brian Bowen]], signed on 7 August 2018 and assigned to the Sydney Kings.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/news/article/38851-38851-2 |title=Sydney Kings unveil Next Star Brian Bowen |publisher=Sydney Kings |date=7 August 2018 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Uniforms ===\n\nSince the [[2018\u201319 NBL season|2018\u201319 season]], [[First Ever]] has supplied the uniforms for all teams in the league, including round specific uniforms (such as the Wildcats' Pink round and Taipans' Blackout round).<ref>{{cite web |title=A First Ever for Australian Basketball |url=https://nbl.com.au/news/article/a-first-ever-for-australian-basketball |website=nbl.com.au |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== City Round ====\n\nWith the introduction of First Ever as uniform supplier in 2018, the NBL announced the \"City\" round.

It was revived in 1988 when North and South teams competed. This match was played annually until 1997. In [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304 season]] the concept was revived with an East-West match being held in Melbourne.

The [[1998\u201399 NBL season|1998\u201399 season]], which began only months later, was the first to be played during the summer season (October\u2013April). The shift, which is currently used by the league, was an attempt to avoid competing directly against [[Football in Australia|Australia's various winter season football codes]].\n\nThe NBL experienced its \"golden age\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s,<ref>[https://blogs.crikey.com.au/sports/2008/12/10/the-decline-of-the-nbl/ The decline of the NBL], [[Crikey]], December 10, 2008</ref> but its popularity, media attention, attendance and corporate support deteriorated and plateaued in the decade afterward.\n\nA second Melbourne club, the [[South Dragons]], entered the league in the [[2006\u201307 NBL season|2006\u201307 season]], but was short lived, soon folding 3 years later after the [[2008\u201309 NBL season|2008\u201309 season]] in which they were premiers. In the 2006\u201307 season, the NBL became the first Australasian sporting league to field a team from Asia with the [[Singapore Slingers]] playing. The [[Gold Coast Blaze]] also joined the competition in the [[2007\u201308 NBL season|2007\u201308 season]]. In 2007, Australian NBA player [[Andrew Bogut]] suggested the NBL try to adopt a model similar to the Australian Football League (AFL) whereby there are the same 10 or 15 teams over a 10-year period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adopt AFL model|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/old-sport-pages/adopt-afl-model/story-e6frfgbf-1111113718503|work=HeraldSun.com|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nblcage.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Melbourne Tigers]] and [[Gold Coast Blaze]] at [[State Netball and Hockey Centre]]]]\n \nA turbulent period during 2008 and 2009 saw the league lose teams from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Singapore.\n\nThe [[2009\u201310 NBL season|2009\u201310 season]] earmarked as the season in which the NBL would begin its revamping, much like the old [[National Soccer League]] which became the eight team [[A-League]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our history|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/aleague/history|work=footballaustralia.com.au|accessdate=15 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022145515/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/aleague/history|archivedate=22 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The NBL returned to [[free-to-air]] television in Australia for the first time in three years with [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] broadcasting 2\u20133 games a week.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 NBL season|2010\u201311 season]] saw the return of the [[Sydney Kings]] after the club was purchased for {{AUD}}20,000 on 31 July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kings return on the cards|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/other-sports/basketball/kings-return-on-the-cards/story-e6frf3f3-1111117076589|work=foxsports.com.au|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the NBL had a de-merger from [[Basketball Australia]].<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1qc1ht5gytmew1c6r352rhpr4k Basketball Australia and National Basketball League to move forward with de-merger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026154637/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1qc1ht5gytmew1c6r352rhpr4k |date=26 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/basketball/the-national-basketball-league-will-relaunch-its-own-competition/story-fni2u9cl-1226676484238 The National Basketball League will relaunch its own competition]</ref>\n\nCrowds improved for the [[2013\u201314 NBL season]], recording the highest cumulative crowd attendance figures for the past five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/q6ujg582svk91sq2lkcg7cs0c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311195933/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/q6ujg582svk91sq2lkcg7cs0c |archivedate=11 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter numerous teams folding and a plummeting public profile property developer Larry Kestelman purchased a 51% portion of the league.

In addition the Asian/Oceania born player rule, introduced for the 2016\u201317 season, allows for clubs to recruit players born in countries such as [[India]], [[Guam]] and [[Japan]] who would not count as imports under NBL rules.<ref>https://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/brisbane-bullets-sign-japanese-star-makoto-hiejima-for-the-upcoming-nbl-season/news-story/c8465e9ca1104cd442c45497239cecb5</ref>\n\nThe growth of Basketball in Asia over recent years and the overall strength and standard of Australian Basketball should ensure the sustainability of the league for many years provided Asian players continue to strive to compete in the NBL and Asian basketball fans are able to follow the league.

From 1985\u20131987, the Bullets and 36ers were the two dominant teams in the league and the two clubs met in the [[1986 NBL Finals|1986 NBL Grand Final]], the first NBL GF to be played over a 3-game series. An Australian indoor sports attendance record of around 11,000 saw the first game of the 1986 series played at the [[Brisbane Entertainment Centre]] with Adelaide, who had a 24\u20132 record for the [[1986 NBL season|season]], winning 122\u2013119 in overtime. Brisbane then handed Adelaide its only home loss of 1986 (the 36ers had gone 13\u20130 at the [[Apollo Stadium]]) when they won Game 2 104\u201383 before Adelaide won its first NBL title with a 113\u201391 win at Apollo in Game 3. The teams were evenly matched at the time with players such as Al Green, Mark Davis, Bill Jones, Peter Ali, [[Darryl Pearce]], [[Mike McKay (basketball)|Mike McKay]] and Dwayne Nelson (Adelaide) against Brisbane's star import [[Leroy Loggins]], captain [[Larry Sengstock]], guard [[Ron Radliff]], forwards [[Danny Morseu]], Robert Sibley and Chris McGraw, centre [[John Dorge]] and (in 1985 and 1986) Cal Bruton. Loggins was the NBL MVP in 1986 and 1987 (and player of the match in the 1985 GF) while Mark Davis was the Grand Final MVP in 1986 and shared the league MVP award with Loggins in [[1987 NBL season|1987]].\n\nThe Rivalry between the two clubs again reached fever pitch in the mid-1990s when Bullets guard [[Shane Heal]] earned the ire of the Adelaide crowd during Game 3 of the [[1994 NBL season|1994 Elimination final]] series when he gave the crowd at the [[Clipsal Powerhouse]] a 'double bird'. Heal, who had scored 61 points in the last regular season game before scoring 42 points in Game 1 to lead Brisbane to a 116\u2013105 home win over the 36ers, had not actually managed to score a point before half time in Game 2 which the 36ers had won 99\u201391 before also winning Game 3 101\u201384. Heal, along with former 36er [[Mark Bradtke]] who had left under acrimonious circumstances at the end of [[1992 NBL season|1992]] to join the Melbourne Tigers, became public enemy #1 to the 36ers crowd following the incident.\n\nWith the Bullets returning to the NBL in 2016, the rivalry has continued with Adelaide defeating the Bullets in their first encounter at home, the Bullets returning the favour with an away win in Adelaide, while a week later Adelaide spoiled the Bullets regular season return to the Entertainment Centre for the first time since 1997 with a resounding 101\u201383 win.<ref>[http://www.nbl.com.au/livestats/?matchid=314733&page=strip Bullets vs 36ers - NBL Round 8, 2016-17]</ref>\n\n'''''[[Adelaide 36ers]] vs [[Melbourne United]]'''''\n\nApart from the normal South Australian and Victorian rivalry, the 36ers vs United (formerly Tigers) rivalry started at the end of the 1992 season when 36ers centre [[Mark Bradtke]] joined Spanish club [[CB Murcia|Juver Murcia]] following the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain for a short stint. Before he left he signed an agreement with the 36ers stating that he would finish his one-year contract with the club should he return within a certain time. Upon his return to Australia, Bradtke stated his intention not to return to the 36ers with the Tigers rumoured to be actively chasing him. After protracted negotiations with 36ers management that led to the club being prepared to buy out his remaining contract, the NBL stepped in and vetoed the buy out, effectively letting Bradtke leave for Melbourne without the 36ers receiving any compensation for the remainder of his contract with the club. When Bradtke returned to Adelaide with the Tigers on 4 July 1993 he was soundly booed whenever he touched the ball by the 8,000 strong crowd at the [[Clipsal Powerhouse]]. The booing of Bradtke and the [[Andrew Gaze]] led Tigers continued for a number of seasons.\n\nA new rivalry has emerged with [[Julius Hodge]], a former 36er, returning to the NBL in November 2009, signing with the Melbourne Tigers. Hodge was a star in Adelaide when he joined the 36ers mid-season the previous two years, however issues relating to alleged missed payments caused him to walk out on the club in early January 2009 on bad terms.<ref name=\"heraldsun-hodge\">{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/old-sport-pages/no-show-hodge-quits-36ers/story-e6frfgbf-1111118512303 | title=No-show Julius Hodge quits Adelaide 36ers | work=HeraldSun.com | date=8 January 2009 | accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nHodge returned to his old home court for the first time on 5 December 2009 in a Tigers overtime victory. After being heckled and taunted all night in a quiet game by his standards, Hodge caused more controversy when he stamped and spat on the [[Brett Maher (basketball)|Brett Maher]] signature on the centre of the Brett Maher Court following his new club's win. He was booed off aggressively and loudly by the Adelaide fans and needed security to escort him out of the stadium.<ref name=\"abc-hodge\">{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-12-06/hodge-sticks-the-boot-into-adelaide/1171266 | title=Hodge sticks the boot into Adelaide | work=ABC.net.au | date=6 December 2009 | accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''''[[Adelaide 36ers]] vs [[Perth Wildcats]]'''''\n\nBoth teams were perennial championship contenders in the late 1980s and early 90s and had several marquee players with excellent match-ups, the three most notable all involving American imports: [[Al Green (basketball)|Al Green]] (Adelaide) vs [[Cal Bruton]] (Perth), [[Mark Davis (basketball, born 1960)|Mark Davis]] (Adelaide) vs [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] (Perth) and [[Bill Jones (basketball, born 1966)|Bill Jones]] (Adelaide) vs [[Tiny Pinder]] (Perth). Games during this era were rarely blowouts and helped to fuel the rivalry. Adelaide won the 1986 NBL Championship over the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and Bruton, who moved from Brisbane to be player-coach of Perth in 1987, built a team specifically to beat the reigning champions. Despite the long time rivalry between the two clubs, and the two teams having played numerous semi-final series against each other with the first being in that [[1987 NBL season|1987 season]], they did not face each other in a grand final series until the [[2013\u201314 NBL season|2013\u201314 season]], which was won by the Perth Wildcats. the Wildcats have won each semi-finals series played between the two (1987, [[1989 NBL Finals|1989]] and [[1995 NBL season|1995]]).\n\nThe 1995 series proved to be one of the most volatile and controversial due to an incident between 36ers forward Chris Blakemore and Perth's [[Martin Cattalini]] in Game 1 in Adelaide. Under instructions from coach [[Mike Dunlap]] to basically belt the next Perth player to go through the key, Blakemore back handed Cattalini, giving the Wildcats forward a large cut on his mouth that required 15 stitches. Blakemore was suspended for Game 2 in [[Perth Entertainment Centre|Perth]] as the Wildcats swept the 36ers 2\u20130 before going on to defeat the defending champion [[North Melbourne Giants]] (who had swept Adelaide in 1994) 2\u20131 in the Grand Final. In an ironic twist, Cattalini would join the 36ers in 1996 and later went on to win two championships with the club (plus another with Perth), while Blakemore, the NBL's Rookie of the year in [[1993 NBL season|1993]] and its Most Improved Player award winner in [[1994 NBL season|1994]], as well as playing for the [[Australian boomers|Australian Boomers]] in 1995, joined the [[Canberra Cannons]] in 1996 and his career went downhill from there with his NBL career ending at the end of [[1997 NBL season|1997]] after just two seasons with the Cannons.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKnxKzpuxsU&t=1s Title Town - Adelaide 36ers in the 1990s]</ref>\n\nAs the mainstay players began to slow with age and retire, the intensity of this rivalry has declined. The two clubs remain the most successful in the NBL with four championships for Adelaide and nine for Perth and are first and second on the all-time wins list (709 wins for Perth, 670 wins for Adelaide as of November 15, 2019) and have also matched up on more occasions (134 times total; Perth leading all time between the two 73 \u2013 61) than any other two teams in the NBL (as of November 15, 2019). The rivalry continues into the [[2012\u201313 NBL season|2012\u201313 season]] with the 36ers beating the Wildcats in back to back games in rounds 6 and 7, including the opening game at Perth's new home, the [[Perth Arena]], in front of a then record Wildcats crowd of 11,562.\n\nThe Wildcats and 36ers dominated the [[2013\u201314 NBL season]], finishing first and second respectively during the regular round. After the three previous semi-final meetings, they then faced off in their first ever Grand Final series which saw the Wildcats emerge with their record 6th NBL championship with a 2\u20131 series win. This was one of the most anticipated series in NBL history, not only given the two clubs' long-standing rivalry, but also due to the post-game on court 'brawl' which took place following their Round 18 clash in Perth earlier in the season.\n\nAdelaide and Perth play for the Cattalini Cup named for Perth born Martin Cattalini who won two championships with each club. In each game, the game MVP is awarded with the [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]] Medal named for Adelaide born centre Paul Rogers who made his NBL debut for the 36ers in 1992 and later joined Perth, winning 2 championships and the NBL MVP award in 2000 while with the Wildcats.\n\n'''''[[Cairns Taipans]] vs [[Townsville Crocodiles]]'''''\n\nA local derby-style rivalry nicknamed \"Reptile Rumble\" has developed to determine which is the dominant North Queensland team. The Cairns-Townsville basketball rivalry would have to be one of the longest and most passionate in the NBL.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Both teams generally attract a close to capacity crowd anywhere from 4000+ at their home games. Each team and their supporters and mascots generally boo and taunt their visiting rivals. The rivalry has been in existent for over 10 years and almost came to a near end when the Cairns Taipans were on the verge of extinction due to financial issues.\n\nThe rivalry between the two North Queensland based clubs is currently extinct due to the Crocodiles folding at the end of the [[2015\u201316 NBL season]].\n\n'''''[[Illawarra Hawks]] vs [[Sydney Kings]]'''''\n\nHawks fans consider the Sydney Kings to be their most fierce rival. Many Hawks players have moved to the Kings including two former Rookie of the Year winners and a two-time Olympian. In the absence of the Kings, the [[Sydney Spirit]] took the role of rival, but this felt fake to some Hawks faithful. The Hawks took bragging rights after the [[2000\u201301 NBL season|2000\u201301 season]] when they became the first team from New South Wales to qualify for the NBL finals, which they won against Townsville. Sydney then took the ascendency when they won three championships in a row, including a clean sweep of the Hawks.\n\n'''''[[New Zealand Breakers]] vs [[Perth Wildcats]]'''''\n\nThe Breakers and Wildcats have arguably been the league's current strongest teams, and have been fairly evenly matched. Between them, they have won every year's league from 2009\u201310 to 2016\u201317, and met in the final in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 (both won by the Breakers) and 2015\u201316 (won by the Wildcats). Both teams have similarities in that they have to travel great distances to play any other NBL team. These two factors have combined to make a \"derby of distance\" between the NBL's farthest-flung members. The rivalry may have its origins in a scrap between players from each side after a game in 2004.<ref>Brown, Michael \"[http://m.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10875436 Basketball: Inside the Breakers-Wildcat rivalry]\", ''New Zealand Herald'', 5 April 2013.

Currently, teams are limited to having three imports (i.e., non-Australasians) on the roster at any one time; league initiatives in recent years have added two roster slots that may be filled by imports without counting against the three-import limit. Some of these players have moved to Australia permanently and become Australian citizens; a few including [[Cal Bruton]], [[Mark Davis (basketball, born 1960)|Mark Davis]], [[Leroy Loggins]] and [[Ricky Grace]] have even played for the Australian national team (under a [[FIBA]] rule that allows one naturalised player to compete for a national team).\n\nThe NBL's salary cap for the 2006\u201307 season was {{AUD}}776,000, and increased to {{AUD}}810,000 for the 2007\u201308 season; the cap rose for two consecutive years due to the continued growth of the league. The salary cap rose {{AUD}}1,000,000 for the 2009\u201310 season. The cap remains at {{AUD}}1,000,000 for the 2012\u201313 season.<ref name=\"nbl-salarycap\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nbl.com.au/salary-cap-player-points | title=Salary Cap/Player Points | work=NBL.com.au | accessdate=5 April 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211031456/http://www.nbl.com.au/salary-cap-player-points | archivedate=11 February 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, the salary cap was changed from a {{AUD}}1,000,000 \u2018hard cap\u2019 to a {{AUD}}1,100,000 \u2018soft cap\u2019. Teams may exceed the soft cap provided that they pay a salary equalisation subsidy based on the extent to which they have exceeded the cap. In addition, player values for purposes of the salary cap are not based on the salary submitted to the league, but are determined by a special NBL panel. The cap regulations also mandate that teams distribute their salaries so that at least one group of five players has a collective cap value of no more than {{AUD}}400,000. Both cap numbers (the soft cap and the 5-player aggregate cap) have increased since then, based on average league salaries.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/nbl-announces-changes-to-player-contract-salary-rules/ |title=NBL announces changes to player contract & salary rules |publisher=National Basketball League |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 2014, to help attract high-calibre imports or offer financial incentive for local stars considering overseas opportunities, the NBL introduced a marquee player rule, in which a team can nominate one player whose salary is paid outside the cap, with a 25% Marquee Player levy applied to any payment made above the salary cap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/lkin9ku730qr138bw2cx4l6iz |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084347/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/lkin9ku730qr138bw2cx4l6iz |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1lq35tllwbh751od46t481bey9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108084204/http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1lq35tllwbh751od46t481bey9 |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2016\u201317 season, the value was modified so that if the marquee player is a \"non-restricted\" player (explained below), only the first $150,000 of that player's salary will be counted toward that team's salary cap.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\"/>\n\nNBL legend Andrew Gaze has pointed to these changes being instrumental to the improvement of NBL and its Australian players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aussiehoopla.com/andrew-gaze-nbl-podcast|title=Aussie NBL players will have to \"get better\" according to Andrew Gaze|website=www.aussiehoopla.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref>\n\nAlso effective in 2016\u201317, the number of import roster slots was increased from two to three, and each team was allowed (but not required) to have one player from a [[FIBA Asia]] or [[FIBA Oceania]] country other than Australia or New Zealand on its roster who would not be counted against the import limit. Since then, the NBL has used the term \"non-restricted\" to describe all players signed as locals, including Asian/Oceanian players signed under the regional initiative.<ref name=\"nbl.com.au\"/> With this change, many of the best Asian-born players were expected to seek NBL contracts, as teams can now recruit them and play them as locals.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/japans-makoto-hiejima-signs-with-brisbane-bullets-under-nbls-asian-player-rule/news-story/5e6c5185d1cfee581db2eddca2bca05b</ref>\n\n==== Next Stars Program ====\n\nMost recently, the NBL announced the \"Next Stars\" initiative on 2 March 2018, effective with the league's 2018\u201319 season. The scheme is designed to provide young elite overseas players, mainly Americans (who are currently [[Eligibility for the NBA draft|barred from the NBA draft]] until one year out of secondary school), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball, with a professional option immediately out of secondary school. Each team will receive one additional import roster slot intended to provide a \"Next Star\" slot. Players who will be part of the scheme will be selected by a special NBL panel and, should they accept the league's offer, be contracted directly by the NBL and placed into an allocation pool to be distributed among the league's teams. The chosen players will receive a salary of {{AUD}}100,000, as well as a car, apartment, and flights home during league breaks. The scheme will be funded for the first season by the NBL, meaning that \"Next Star\" players will not count against the salary cap. Finally, under current rules, the NBA allows its teams to spend up to {{USD}}700,000 to buy players out of professional contracts in non-North American leagues; should a \"Next Star\" be bought out by an NBA team (or by a team in another overseas league), the buyout amount will be split between the team and the NBL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22594625/how-australian-basketball-targeting-one-dones-nba-draft |title=How Australian basketball is targeting one-and-dones |first=Jonathan |last=Givony |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=1 March 2018 |accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/nbl/nbl-launches-next-stars-program-targeting-potential-oneanddone-athletes/news-story/b448cd87c44396ace425de70777954be |title=NBL launches \u2018Next Stars\u2019 program, targeting potential one-and-done athletes |first=Olgun |last=Uluc |publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)]] |date=2 March 2018 |accessdate=5 March 2018}}\n</ref> The first player signed to a Next Star contract was American [[Brian Bowen]], signed on 7 August 2018 and assigned to the Sydney Kings.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sydneykings.com/news/article/38851-38851-2 |title=Sydney Kings unveil Next Star Brian Bowen |publisher=Sydney Kings |date=7 August 2018 |accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Uniforms ===\n\nSince the [[2018\u201319 NBL season|2018\u201319 season]], [[First Ever]] has supplied the uniforms for all teams in the league, including round specific uniforms (such as the Wildcats' Pink round and Taipans' Blackout round).<ref>{{cite web |title=A First Ever for Australian Basketball |url=https://nbl.com.au/news/article/a-first-ever-for-australian-basketball |website=nbl.com.au |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== City Round ====\n\nWith the introduction of First Ever as uniform supplier in 2018, the NBL announced the \"City\" round.

In [[2003\u201304 NBL season|2003\u201304 season]] the concept was revived with an East-West match being held in Melbourne. The following season saw a change of format, with a local team (Aussie All-Stars) playing an imports team (World All-Star). This was discontinued after the [[2007\u201308 NBL season|2007\u201308 season]]. The concept was revived in 2012 with an All-Star game between North and South that was scheduled for December 2012.<ref name=\"nbl-allstarreturn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.adelaide36ers.com/article/id/1c9e543thm7s01tdgr8m4xskvx | title=NBL Brings Basketball All-Stars to Adelaide | work=NBL.com.au | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=22 October 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060603/http://www.adelaide36ers.com/article/id/1c9e543thm7s01tdgr8m4xskvx | archivedate=23 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Basketball in Australia]]\n* [[List of attendance figures at domestic professional sports leagues]] \u2013 the NBL in a worldwide context\n* [[List of National Basketball League (Australia) venues]]\n* [[NBL (Australia) All-time Records|NBL All-time Records]]\n* [[Women's National Basketball League]]\n* [[National Basketball League (New Zealand)|New Zealand National Basketball League]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.nbl.com.au/}}\n* [http://australia.basketball/ Basketball Australia official website]\n* [http://andthefoul.net/NBLwiki/ NBL Wiki website]\n* [http://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball Fox Sports Australia Basketball Section]\n* [http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/nbl-announces-changes-to-player-contract-salary-rules/ NBL's changes to player contract and salary rules]\n* [http://www.aussiehoopla.com/nbl-all-time-statistics/ NBL All-Time Stats] at aussiehoopla.com\n* [https://www.spatialjam.com/nbl-historical-stats NBL Historical Stats] at spatialjam.com\n\n{{NBL}}\n{{NBL seasons}}\n{{Basketball in Australia}}\n{{Men's professional basketball leagues}}\n{{Sports leagues of Australia}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball League (Australia)| ]]\n[[Category:Fox Sports (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Basketball leagues in Australia]]\n[[Category:Basketball leagues in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Professional sports leagues in Australia]]\n[[Category:Professional sports leagues in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues established in 1979]]\n", "name_user": "Xindeho", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(Australia)"}

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0] = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = {[(n+\u00bd)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7210\u00b0}\u00b2 where n = 0,1,2,3\u2026\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 is the smallest natural number greater than (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 3n\u00b2\u2212(180\u00b0\u2212 A\u00d7n\u00f760\u00b0)\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

Substitute P with 73 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2087\u2083 = MOD[180\u00b0\u00d7(73\u22121)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212225\u00b0,360\u00b0] = MOD[180\u00d78.4853\u2212225,360]\u00b0 = 222.35\u00b0, which is close to 225\u00b0.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Spiral Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 1+{[(n+\u215d)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7180\u00b0}\u00b2\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the spiral chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 315\u00b0\u2212(r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d745\u00b0\u00f7n\n\nWhere:\n\nP = The price of which the angle is to be found\n\nr\u2092 = The smallest odd number higher than the square root of P\n\nn = (r\u2092\u22121)\u00f72 or the chart layer on which P locates\n\nTaking 73 as an example again:\n\nSince 73<sup>\u00bd</sup> \u2245 8.544, so r\u2092 = 9 > 8.544\n\nn = (9-1)\u00f72 = 4\n\nA\u2087\u2083 = 315\u00b0\u2212(9\u00b2\u221273)\u00d745\u00b0\u00f74 = 315\u00b0\u2212 90\u00b0 = 225\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Spiral Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = (2n+1)\u00b2\u2212(315\u00b0\u2212A\u00d7n\u00f745\u00b0)\n\n===== Anecdote =====\nOn p.69 of Gann\u2019s novel [[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking back from 1940]] (1927), the numbers \u201c1940\u201d and \u201c69\u201d lined up at the top of the page.<ref name=\":0\" /> Incidentally, the sequence 19, 40, 69 appeared on one of the cardinal axes of the Spiral Chart.

Gann|300x300px]]Very similar to the Spiral Chart, the Hexagon Chart is also a matrix of consecutive natural numbers, but the difference is that it starts with 0 in the central point, and the numbers spiral out in the form of a hexagon instead a square.<ref name=\":3\" /> The spiral direction in Gann's original course is also counterclockwise, because of its astrological overlay.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematically, the numbers in each additional layer represent the [[hexagonal number]]s, which are the number of distinct dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Numbers: Adventures in Mathematics, Mind, and Meaning|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0195157994|location=New York: NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it is found that Gann used the following method to overlay planetary positions on the Hexagon Chart:<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n* The axis going from 0 to 1,11, 28, and so on are 60\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 2, 10, 24, and so on are 120\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 3, 12, 27, and so on are 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 4, 14, 30, and so on are 240\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 5, 16, 33, and so on are 300\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 6, 18, 36, and so on are 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].\n\nAgain, the above mathematical relationship could be demonstrated by this mathematical formula:<ref name=\":18\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Integers on the cardinal angles (60\u00b0\u00d7) of the Hexagon Chart\n!{{diagonal split header|Layer|Degree}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |60\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |120\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |180\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |240\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |300\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |360\u00b0\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|10\n|12\n|14\n|16\n|18\n|-\n!3\n|21\n|24\n|27\n|30\n|33\n|36\n|-\n!4\n|40\n|44\n|48\n|52\n|56\n|60\n|-\n!5\n|65\n|70\n|75\n|80\n|85\n|90\n|-\n!n\n|3n\u00b2\u22122n\n|3n\u00b2\u2212n\n|3n\u00b2\n|3n\u00b2+n\n|3n\u00b2+2n\n|3(n\u00b2+n)\n|}\n\n===== Mathematical formula of the Hexagon Chart =====\nLike the Spiral Chart, there are two methods of calculation.<ref name=\":13\" /> The first one is simpler not as accurate as the second one.\n\n====== Method 1 ======\nSimilar to the Spiral Chart, for any natural number P>1, its approximate angular value A (in degrees) is given by:\n\nA\u209a = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d7P<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0]\n\nFor example, from the Hexagon Chart, it is known that the angular value of 44 is 120\u00b0. Substitute P with 36 into the above formula:\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = MOD[210\u00b0\u00d744<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180\u00b0,360\u00b0] = 132.98\u00b0 which is roughly equal to 120\u00b0 on the chart.\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = {[(n+\u00bd)\u00d7360\u00b0+A]\u00f7210\u00b0}\u00b2 where n = 0,1,2,3\u2026\n\n====== Method 2 ======\nTo find the exact angle on the Hexagon Chart, one has to use a slightly more complicated formula below.\n\nA\u209a = 180\u00b0\u2212(3r\u2092\u00b2\u2212P)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f7r\u2092\n\nWhere r\u2092 is the smallest natural number greater than (P\u00f73)<sup>\u00bd</sup>\n\nLet us take 44 as an example:\n\n(44/3)<sup>\u00bd</sup> = 3.8297, r\u2092 = 4\n\nA\u2084\u2084 = 180\u00b0\u2212(3\u00d74\u00b2-44)\u00d760\u00b0\u00f74 = 120\u00b0\n\nConversely, to calculate price P given the angle A on the n\u1d57\u02b0 layer of the Hexagon Chart:\n\nP\u2099 = 3n\u00b2\u2212(180\u00b0\u2212 A\u00d7n\u00f760\u00b0)\n\n==== Practical examples ====\n[[File:The_Hexagon_Chart_and_the_Corn_Market_Top_in_March_1925.jpg|thumb|300x300px|In March, Saturn was at 224\u00b0 and Venus was at 344\u00b0. The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

However, unlike a conventional pinball game, the play field extends upwards endlessly.  The display follows the ball as it moves.  Multiple flippers are placed throughout the play field.  There is no drain; play is limited by a timer.  The challenge is to go as far as possible up the play field, within the available time.<ref name=Wired />\n\nThe player controls the flippers by tapping the left or right of the screen.  The player can also hold the flippers to \"catch\" the ball, for a more precise shot.<ref name=PocketGamer />\n\nTo gain additional time, the player can hit glowing dots with the ball.  If time expires, play ends.  There are ten [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoints]] in the game.  With an [[in-app purchase]], the player can enable restarting from past checkpoints, restoring their progress to that point.

However, unlike a conventional pinball game, the play field extends upwards endlessly.  The display follows the ball as it moves.  Multiple flippers are placed throughout the play field.  There is no drain; play is limited by a timer.  The challenge is to go as far as possible up the play field, within the available time.<ref name=Wired />\n\nThe player controls the flippers by tapping the left or right of the screen.  The player can also hold the flippers to \"catch\" the ball, for a more precise shot.<ref name=PocketGamer />\n\nTo gain additional time, the player can hit glowing dots with the ball.  If time expires, play ends.  There are ten [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoints]] in the game.  With an [[in-app purchase]], the player can enable restarting from past checkpoints, restoring their progress to that point.  Otherwise, players must start at the beginning.<ref name=Wired />\n\nIf the player makes it past the main play fields, there is an \"Overtime\" mode, where the player keeps playing the same course until time expires.<ref name=Wired />\n\n=== Minigames ===\n\nThere are four different [[minigame]]s (one of these is [[easter egg]] to ''[[Does not Commute]]'', another Mediocre AB game) which, when played, add the resulting score to the timer.
