Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official.

In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973.

Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

founded in 1775 by Luis de C\u00f3rdova, is a city and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] located in the northwestern tip of [[Puerto Rico]], bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]], and [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] and west of [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer's Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a {{convert|22000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} meeting facility. The hospital is now the Courtyard by Marriott Punta Borinquen Resort & Casino,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |title=Marriott.com |access-date=2007-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012044552/http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |archive-date=2007-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> a 150-room hotel with a casino and the first Marriott in Puerto Rico out of the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] Metropolitan Area.\n\nRamey also hosts the [[University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla|University of Puerto Rico \u2013 Aguadilla Campus]] and the Friedrich Froebel Bilingual School<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827093233/http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> (K-9).

Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7\u201312).  Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

It stopped at the Jimenez Station in Aguadilla for a routine [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] and [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading towards San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3's ride from Jimenez Station to Ponce was Jose Antonio Roman, an experienced freight train engineer, but who had never worked in passenger travel.<ref name=\"endi\"/> When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it was hauling 6 passenger cars with hundreds of commuters and two freight cars.\n[[File:Cuesta Vieja, street in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|{{lang|es|Cuesta Vieja}} in Aguadilla]]\n\nAt 2:20&nbsp;a.m. the train started to descend a hill section known as ''Cuesta Vieja'' (Old Hill) in Aguadilla at what some witnesses described as an exaggerated speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it [[Derailment|derailed]]. The steam locomotive crashed into a ditch where it exploded and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.<ref name=\"endi\"/> Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to the local [[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]] newspaper, summarized the scene in a more dramatic way: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".<ref name=\"endi\"/> In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|title=Puerto Rico y aquel tren que nunca lleg\u00f3 a destino|language=es|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928140427/http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|archive-date=2019-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguadilla is located in the northwest coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]], in the Western Coastal Plains.

In general, businesses and upper income groups will mostly benefit regardless, while lower income groups will see the initial benefits fade over time or be adversely impacted. For example, the CBO and JCT estimated that:\n\n* During 2019, income groups earning under $20,000 (about 23% of taxpayers) would contribute to deficit reduction (i.e. incur a cost), mainly by receiving fewer subsidies due to the repeal of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act.

The initial deficit increase estimate without feedback effects of $1,456{{nbsp}}billion, less $384{{nbsp}}billion in feedback effects ($451{{nbsp}}billion less $66{{nbsp}}billion in higher debt service costs), results in a $1,071{{nbsp}}billion net debt increase over the 2018\u20132027 period. This increase is in addition to the $10{{nbsp}}trillion debt increase already in the CBO current law baseline projected over the 2018\u20132027 period, and the approximately $20{{nbsp}}trillion [[National debt of the United States|national debt]] that already exists.\n*Employment would be about 0.6% higher each year during the 2018\u20132027 period than otherwise.

Nevertheless, as of early 2018, the proposed rejected Short Title name had gained currency within some political and professional circles who continue to use \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" to refer to Public Law 115-97, and so the Act may be inaccurately referred to by its rejected Short Title in some instances.\n\n===Federal Reserve===\nFederal Reserve officials had indicated earlier in 2017 that aggressive tax cuts could increase the pace of interest rate increases already planned. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, slowing economic growth (GDP), other things equal. The Fed also raises interest rates to help offset the risk of inflation in a growing economy near full employment. However, as the tax plan became clearer and its impact on the economy was judged to be relatively minor, the Fed indicated that a plan to raise interest rates incrementally as many as three times in 2018 would not be changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/business/economy/fed-interest-rates.html|title=Fed Predicts Modest Economic Growth From Tax Cut|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|publisher=|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>Binyamin Appelbaum, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html A Trump Economic Boom?

In December 2018, Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|District Court of Northern Texas]] issued his opinion in agreement with the states that without the individual mandate, the whole of the ACA had no standing.

In other words, under a territorial tax system, the corporation saves the difference between the generally higher U.S. tax rate and the lower rate of the country in which the subsidiary is legally established.

Nevertheless, as of early 2018, the proposed rejected Short Title name had gained currency within some political and professional circles who continue to use \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" to refer to Public Law 115-97, and so the Act may be inaccurately referred to by its rejected Short Title in some instances.\n\n===Federal Reserve===\nFederal Reserve officials had indicated earlier in 2017 that aggressive tax cuts could increase the pace of interest rate increases already planned. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, slowing economic growth (GDP), other things equal. The Fed also raises interest rates to help offset the risk of inflation in a growing economy near full employment. However, as the tax plan became clearer and its impact on the economy was judged to be relatively minor, the Fed indicated that a plan to raise interest rates incrementally as many as three times in 2018 would not be changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/business/economy/fed-interest-rates.html|title=Fed Predicts Modest Economic Growth From Tax Cut|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|publisher=|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>Binyamin Appelbaum, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html A Trump Economic Boom?

Given that their stipends are significantly less than the waived tuition, this would typically increase their taxes by 30\u201360% for public universities and hundreds of percent for private ones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16619246/tax-bill-trump-gop-cuts-and-jobs-act-graduate-students-tuition-waiver-reductions|title=The Republican tax plan could financially devastate graduate students|work=The Verge|accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/07/grad-students-and-policy-experts-say-taxing-graduate-students-tuition-waivers-would|title='Taxing a Coupon'|work=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref> The Senate version of the bill did not contain these provisions.<ref name=\"Timmer\">{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/tax-bill-that-passed-the-house-would-cripple-training-of-scientists/|work=Ars Technica|first=John|last=Timmer|title=Tax bill that passed the House would cripple training of scientists|date=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe House bill's disadvantageous treatment of graduate students was criticized because of its projected negative effect on the training of U.S. scientists.<ref name=\"Timmer\"/> The bill's impact on U.S. science and innovation had been criticized by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor emeritus [[Burton Richter]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] and the [[National Medal of Science]], who critiqued the bill's negative impact on Americans seeking advanced degrees and wrote that the budget impact of the tax cuts would force a dramatic reduction in federal funding for scientific research.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/360662-why-the-tax-bill-is-bad-for-science-innovation-and-america|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|first1=Michael|last1=S.

In December 2018, Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|District Court of Northern Texas]] issued his opinion in agreement with the states that without the individual mandate, the whole of the ACA had no standing. California and several other states led the appeal of the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court]]. The Fifth Circuit affirmed in part with O'Connor's opinion on the unconstitutionality of the ACA without the individual mandate in December 2019. The case was raised to the Supreme Court to be heard as ''[[California v. Texas]]'' during the court's 2020-21 term.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/supreme-court-obamacare-appeal.html | title = Supreme Court to Hear Obamacare Appeal | first = Adam | last = Liptak | date = March 2, 2020 | accessdate = March 2, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bush tax cuts]]\n*[[Reagan tax cuts]]\n*[[Revenue Act of 1964]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf Text of the Law]\n* [https://taxfoundation.org/2018-tax-reform-calculator/ Tax Foundation's calculator to see effect of the law on you]\n*[https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/news/new-tax-reform-changes-website Taxpayer Advocate Service Tax Reform Changes Website]\n\n{{US tax acts}}\n\n[[Category:2017 in economics]]\n[[Category:Acts of the 115th United States Congress]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Donald Trump]]\n[[Category:United States federal reconciliation legislation]]\n[[Category:United States federal taxation legislation]]\n", "name_user": "Bill who knows nothing", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed the last sentence from the 4th paragraph of the introduction to \"Polling shows that there are more Americans opposing the law than those supporting it\".

It had [[Slovaks|Slovak]] inhabitants.\n\n[[File:Old Litava drawing.jpg|thumb|250px|The old Litava castle in late 13th century]]\nScarce ruins of the '''old Litava castle''' can be found south-west of Cerovo on the northern end of the ''Pust\u00fd hrad'' mountain. The Litava Castle was built by Hunt or his son, Big Der\u017e (Der\u0161, Hungarian: Ders) from the [[Hunt-Poznan]] family. The castle was first mentioned in 1276. In this year the grandchildren of Lambert, of the Hunt-Poznan family, Small Der\u017e (Ders) and Demeter captured Litava and robbed valuables of 3000 marks and charters. Therefore, the king confiscated their property and gave their property to Big Der\u017e from the Hunt-Poznan family. Before 1307 Nicholas T\u00fari K\u00f6v\u00e9r, son of Big Der\u017e of the Hunt-Poznan family, exchanged the castle Litava with his relatives, Der\u017e and Demeter of Hunt. In 1318 master Tom\u00e1\u0161, son of Der\u017e of the Hunt-Poznan family, protested against the occupation of Litava by [[Matthew III Cs\u00e1k]]. The castle perished not long after, probably during struggles of the oligarchs.\n\nBut a new castle was built 3 kilometres north-west of the old Litava castle. It was called Litava too until the middle of the 15th century when the new castle would be called [[\u010cabra\u010f Castle|\u010cabra\u010f]] (also called ''Litava, Haradnuk, Haradnok, Chabrad, Chabragh, Lytva, Hradnok, Haradna, Castrum ad Litavan'' etc.). In 1342 the king debarred the new castle together with the old ruined Litava and 26 villages and 6 customs from Peter and Leukus of the Dobrakutyai family because of their treachery according to a charter.\n\nThe village became deserted in the beginning of the 15th century. It became populated again only after Hussite struggles. The local population converted into [[Lutheran]] faith in the 16th century. The present Lutheran church was built between 1855 and 1859.\n\n==Genealogical resources==\n\nThe records for genealogical research are available at the state archive \"Statny Archiv in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia\"\n\n* Roman Catholic church records (births/marriages/deaths): 1850\u20131891 (parish B)\n* Lutheran church records (births/marriages/deaths): 1735\u20131899 (parish A)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Cerovo, Slovakia}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.hrady.sk/cabrad.php?castle=20 About the old and new Litava Castle in Slovak]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313101345/http://mars.elte.hu/varak/cserilitva/litva.htm?rom=2466 About old Litava castle in Hungarian]\n* http://www.e-obce.sk/obec/cerovo/cerovo.html\n* http://www.regionhont.sk/\n*[http://www.cisarik.com/0_Cerovo_Krupina_BC_Hont_Hont.html'''Surnames''' of living people in Cerovo]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Krupina District}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages and municipalities in Krupina District]]\n[[Category:Castles in Slovakia]]\n\n\n{{Bansk\u00e1Bystrica-geo-stub}}\n{{Slovakia-castle-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Cerovo\n| native_name             = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Municipality\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_caption           = \n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| motto                   = \n| nickname                = \n| etymology               = \n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{SVK}}\n| subdivision_type1       = \n| subdivision_name1       = \n| subdivision_type2       = [[Regions of Slovakia|Region]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Districts of Slovakia|District]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Krupina District|Krupina]]\n| subdivision_type4       = \n| subdivision_name4       = \n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_map             = Slovakia Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region#Slovakia\n| pushpin_relief          = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location of Cerovo in the [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region]]##Location of Cerovo in Slovakia\n| coordinates             = {{coord|48|15|N|19|10|E|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = First mentioned\n| established_date        = 1273\n<!-- area -->\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| area_total_sq_mi        = \n| area_land_sq_mi         = \n| area_water_sq_mi        = \n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 468\n| elevation_ft            = \n<!-- population -->\n| population_as_of        = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_density_sq_mi=\n| population_demonym      = \n<!-- time zone(s) -->\n| timezone1               = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset1             = +1\n| timezone1_DST           = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset1_DST         = +2\n<!-- postal codes, area code -->\n| postal_code_type        = Postal code\n| postal_code             = 962 52\n| area_code_type          =  \n| area_code               = 421-45\n| geocode                 = \n| iso_code                = \n| blank_name              = [[Slovak car registration plates|Car plate]]\n| blank_info              = KA\n<!-- website, footnotes -->\n| website                 = [https://www.cerovo.dcom.sk  www.cerovo.dcom.sk]\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Cerovo''' (earlier ''\u010cerov\u00e9, \u010cerowo''; {{lang-hu|Ceri}}) is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] in the [[Krupina District]] of the [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region]] of [[Slovakia]].\n\n== History ==\nThe village was first mentioned as Chery in a charter in 1273, its name is derived from the Old Slavic \"c\u011br\u044a\"/Slovak \"cer\"/Hungarian \"cser\" (the Hungarian word is derived from the Slavic one), which means Turkey oak.

Before 1307 Nicholas T\u00fari K\u00f6v\u00e9r, son of Big Der\u017e of the Hunt-Poznan family, exchanged the castle Litava with his relatives, Der\u017e and Demeter of Hunt. In 1318 master Tom\u00e1\u0161, son of Der\u017e of the Hunt-Poznan family, protested against the occupation of Litava by [[Matthew III Cs\u00e1k]]. The castle perished not long after, probably during struggles of the oligarchs.\n\nBut a new castle was built 3 kilometres north-west of the old Litava castle. It was called Litava too until the middle of the 15th century when the new castle would be called [[\u010cabra\u010f Castle|\u010cabra\u010f]] (also called ''Litava, Haradnuk, Haradnok, Chabrad, Chabragh, Lytva, Hradnok, Haradna, Castrum ad Litavan'' etc.). In 1342 the king debarred the new castle together with the old ruined Litava and 26 villages and 6 customs from Peter and Leukus of the Dobrakutyai family because of their treachery according to a charter.\n\nThe village became deserted in the beginning of the 15th century. It became populated again only after Hussite struggles. The local population converted into [[Lutheran]] faith in the 16th century. The present Lutheran church was built between 1855 and 1859.\n\n==Genealogical resources==\n\nThe records for genealogical research are available at the state archive \"Statny Archiv in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia\"\n\n* Roman Catholic church records (births/marriages/deaths): 1850\u20131891 (parish B)\n* Lutheran church records (births/marriages/deaths): 1735\u20131899 (parish A)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of municipalities and towns in Slovakia]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commonscat-inline|Cerovo, Slovakia}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.hrady.sk/cabrad.php?castle=20 About the old and new Litava Castle in Slovak]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313101345/http://mars.elte.hu/varak/cserilitva/litva.htm?rom=2466 About old Litava castle in Hungarian]\n* http://www.e-obce.sk/obec/cerovo/cerovo.html\n* http://www.regionhont.sk/\n*[http://www.cisarik.com/0_Cerovo_Krupina_BC_Hont_Hont.html'''Surnames''' of living people in Cerovo]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Krupina District}}\n\n[[Category:Villages and municipalities in Krupina District]]\n[[Category:Castles in Slovakia]]\n\n\n{{Bansk\u00e1Bystrica-geo-stub}}\n{{Slovakia-castle-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerovo,_Slovakia"}
