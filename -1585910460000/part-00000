Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice [[compounding]]; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form.

The Pharmacy Degree in Nigeria is unclassified i.e. awarded without first class, second class upper, etc., however graduates could be awarded Pass with Distinctions in specific fields such as Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, medicinal chemistry etc. Pharmacy Graduates are required to undergo 1 year of Tutelage under the supervision of an already Registered Pharmacist(a preceptor) in a recognized and designated Institution before they can become Registered Pharmacists. The Profession is Regulated by a Government Statutory body called the [[Pharmacists Council of Nigeria]]. The West African Post Graduate College of Pharmacy runs post-registration courses on advanced-level practice in various fields of pharmacy.

Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities.

The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the [[European Union]], and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15\u201320-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6\u201316-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, [[Uppsala University]], where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the [[University of Gothenburg]], and [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. In Sweden, pharmacists are called ''Apotekare''. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice.

To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.

Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]].

Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment. Instead, relevant extracts of the British National Formulary will be provided within the assessment paper. \n*Satisfactorily meeting the GPhC's [[Fitness to practice|Fitness to Practice Standards]].\n\n===United States===\nIn 2014 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that there were 297,100 American pharmacist jobs.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

About 5\u20137% of students can pass the exam. There are 3 aspects to the exam. These are on math, chemistry, and physics or biology. After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor's degrees or 4-year bachelor's degrees.

The Pharmacy Degree in Nigeria is unclassified i.e. awarded without first class, second class upper, etc., however graduates could be awarded Pass with Distinctions in specific fields such as Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, medicinal chemistry etc. Pharmacy Graduates are required to undergo 1 year of Tutelage under the supervision of an already Registered Pharmacist(a preceptor) in a recognized and designated Institution before they can become Registered Pharmacists. The Profession is Regulated by a Government Statutory body called the [[Pharmacists Council of Nigeria]]. The West African Post Graduate College of Pharmacy runs post-registration courses on advanced-level practice in various fields of pharmacy.

Not only pharmacists, but also pharmaceutical technicians are allowed to dispense prescription medicines, except for narcotics, psychotropics and very potent medicines. Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities. To become a pharmacy manager in Poland, a pharmacist is expected to have at least 5 years of professional experience.

The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the [[European Union]], and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15\u201320-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6\u201316-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, [[Uppsala University]], where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the [[University of Gothenburg]], and [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. In Sweden, pharmacists are called ''Apotekare''. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the [[University of Basel]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[ETH Zurich]]. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.  The [[University of the West Indies]] in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy.  Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]]. The role of regulatory and professional body on the [[Great Britain|mainland]] was previously carried out by the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]], which remained as a professional body after handing over the regulatory role to the GPhC in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rpharms.com/about-us/history-of-the-society | title = History of the Society | work = Royal Pharmaceutical Society | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe following criteria must be met for qualification as a pharmacist in the United Kingdom (the Northern Irish body and the GPhC operate separately but have broadly similar registration requirements):<ref>{{cite web | publisher = General Pharmaceutical Council | url = http://pharmacyregulation.org/registration/registering-pharmacist | title = Registering as a Pharmacist | access-date = 18 January 2012}}</ref>\n*Successful completion of a 4-year [[Master of Pharmacy]] degree at a GPhC accredited university. Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment. Instead, relevant extracts of the British National Formulary will be provided within the assessment paper. \n*Satisfactorily meeting the GPhC's [[Fitness to practice|Fitness to Practice Standards]].\n\n===United States===\nIn 2014 the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that there were 297,100 American pharmacist jobs.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

About 5\u20137% of students can pass the exam. There are 3 aspects to the exam. These are on math, chemistry, and physics or biology. After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor's degrees or 4-year bachelor's degrees.

In the [http://www.liturgies.net/Liturgies/Eastern/TheDivineLiturgyofMark.htm Liturgy of St. Mark], apparently the most ancient of all, we find this rubric: \"Then follow ''let us attend'', the Apostle, and the Prologue of the Alleluia.\" The \"Apostle\" is the usual ancient Eastern title for the [[Pauline Epistles|Epistle reading]], and the \"Prologue of the Alleluia\" would seem to be a prayer or verse before Alleluia was sung by the choir. It has been suggested that the acclamation arises from and is an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] translation of the African tradition of [[ululation]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hKMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR4&dq=google+books+The+Orthodox+Church+of+Ethiopia:+A+History+(Library+of+Modern+Religion)&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWhdzYu8TlAhVO1lkKHZY7D70Q6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=google%20books%20The%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Ethiopia:%20A%20History%20(Library%20of%20Modern%20Religion)&f=false|title=The Orthodox Church of Ethiopia: A History|last=Binns|first=John|date=2016-11-28|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=9781786730374|location=|pages=25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Western use==\n===Roman rite===\n[[File:Alleluia Vidimus Stellam.png|right|300px|thumb|Example of a pre-Gospel Alleluia with verse]]\nIn the [[Roman Rite]] the word \"Alleluia\" is associated with joy and is especially favoured in [[Eastertide|Paschal time]], the time between [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]], perhaps because of the association of the ''[[Hallel]]'' (Alleluia psalms) chanted at [[Passover]]. During this time, the word is added widely to verses and responses associated with prayers, to antiphons of psalms, and, during the [[Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of Easter and on Pentecost Sunday, to the dismissal at the end of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (\"[[Ite missa est]]\").\n\nOn the other hand, the word \"Alleluia\" is excluded from the Roman liturgy during [[Lent]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter II: The Structure Of The Mass, Its Elements, And Its Parts|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-2.cfm|website=General Instruction Of The Roman Missal|publisher=usccb.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> often euphemistically referred to during this time as the \"A-word\".<ref>https://www.dominicanajournal.org/the-a-word/</ref><ref>https://stmarymagdalenchoir.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/music-for-lent-%E2%80%93-understanding-the-solemnity-of-the-lenten-season/</ref><ref>https://anunslife.org/blog/nun-talk/lent-and-the-a-word</ref> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite it is excluded also in the pre-Lenten [[Septuagesima]] period and in [[Requiem|Masses for the Dead]]. The same word, which normally follows the [[Gloria Patri]] at the beginning of each hour of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] and which in the present ordinary form of the Roman Rite is omitted during Lent, is replaced in pre-1970 forms by the phrase ''Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae'' (Praise to thee, O Lord, king of eternal glory) in Lent and the Septuagesima period.\n\nThe term \"Alleluia\" is used also to designate a chant beginning and ending with this word and including a verse of Scripture, in particular a chant to greet and welcome the Lord whose word will be proclaimed in the Gospel reading. The choir or a cantor sings \"Alleluia\". The congregation repeats this. The choir or cantor then sings a verse taken from the [[Lectionary|Mass Lectionary]] or the [[Roman Gradual]], after which the congregation again sings \"Alleluia\". In Lent the verse alone is sung or the word \"Alleluia\" is replaced by a different acclamation taken from the ''Gradual''. If singing is not used, the Alleluia and its verse may be omitted at any season.<ref>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 62\u221263]</ref><ref name=McNamara>[https://zenit.org/articles/liturgy-q-a-the-alleluia-before-the-gospel/ Edward McNamara, \"LITURGY Q & A: The Alleluia Before the Gospel'' in ZENIT, 6 June 2017]</ref><ref>[http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2011/feb/28/gospel-acclamation-during-lent/ Jeff Ostrowski, \"Gospel Acclamation During Lent\"]</ref>\n\nThe complex [[plainchant]] setting in the Roman Gradual requires a high degree of skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries.<ref name=McNamara/> This melismatic [[Gregorian chant]] opens with the cantor singing \"Alleluia\". The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long [[melisma]] called a [[jubilus]]. (The ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' notates the repeat with the Roman numeral \"ij\" (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings the main part of the verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an [[ambitus (music)|ambitus]] of only a [[perfect fifth]], a rather extreme example.\n\nAlleluias were frequently [[Trope (music)|troped]], both with added music and text. It is believed that some early Sequences derived from syllabic text being added to the jubilus, and may be named after the opening words of the Alleluia verse. Alleluias were also among the more frequently used chants to create early [[organum|organa]], such as in the [[Winchester Troper]].\n\nIn the pre-1970 form of the Roman-Rite Mass the Alleluia and its verse is replaced during Lent and Septuagesima time by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]]. On the other hand, during Eastertide the [[Gradual]] is replaced with an Alleluia chant, thus putting two such chants before the Gospel reading.\n\n==Eastern uses==\n===Byzantine rite===\n[[File:Alleluiarion.jpg|center|thumb|750x750px|Psalm 91 \u1fbf\u0391\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03be\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u1ff3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c8\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f40\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 with the alleluiaria in echos plagios tetartos (allelouia refrains written in red ink before the echos plagios section) in a kontakarion about 1300 ([[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|F-Pn]] fonds grec, Ms. [[#F-PnGr397|397]], f.43r)]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, after reading the Apostle (Epistle) at the [[Divine Liturgy]], the [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]] announces which of the [[Octoechos|Eight Tones]] the Alleluia is to be chanted in. The response of the choir is always the same: \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\" What differs is the tone in which it is sung, and the [[stichera]] (psalm verses) which are intoned by the Reader.\n\nThe Alleluia is paired with the [[Prokeimenon]] which preceded the reading of the Apostle. There may be either one or two Alleluias, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (there may be up to three readings from the Apostle, but never be more than two Prokeimena and Alleluia).\n\nIn the Russian/Slavic order, the Alleluia is intoned in one of the two following manners, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (The Antiochian/Byzantine practice is slightly different):\n\n====One Alleluia====\n:''Deacon:'' \"Let us attend.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the first sticheron of the Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Two Alleluias====\n:''Deacon:'' \"Let us attend.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone:\" Then he immediately chants the first sticheron of the first Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the first Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"In the ____ Tone:\" And he chants the first sticheron of the second Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Lenten Alleluia====\nAmong the Orthodox, the chanting of Alleluia does not cease during Lent, as it does in the West. This is in accordance with the Orthodox approach to fasting, which is one of sober joy. During the weekdays of [[Great Lent]] and certain days during the lesser Lenten seasons ([[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], and [[Dormition Fast]]), the celebration of the Divine Liturgy on weekdays is not permitted. Instead, Alleluia is chanted at [[Matins]]. Since this chanting of Alleluia at Matins is characteristic of Lenten services, Lenten days are referred to as \"Days with Alleluia.\"\n\nThe Alleluia at Matins is not related to scripture readings or Prokeimena; instead, it replaces [[Theos Kyrios|\"God is the Lord...\"]] It is sung in the Tone of the Week and is followed by the Hymns to the Trinity (''Triadica'') in the same tone (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Use|Octoechos]] for an explanation of the eight-week cycle of tones).\n\n\"God is the Lord...\" would normally be intoned by the deacon, but since the deacon does not serve on days with Alleluia, it is intoned by the priest. He stands in front of the [[icon]] of Christ on the [[Iconostasis]], and says:\n\n:''Priest:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone: Out of the night my spirit waketh at dawn unto Thee, O God, for Thy commandments are a light upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Zeal shall lay hold upon an uninstructed people.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Add more evils upon them, O Lord, lay more evils upon them that are glorious upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Alleluia for the departed====\nAlleluia is also chanted to a special melody at [[Christian burial|funerals]], [[Panikhida|memorial services]] (Greek: ''Parastas'', Slavonic: ''Panikhida''), and on [[Saturdays of the Dead]]. Again, it is chanted in place of \"God is the Lord...\", but this time is followed by the [[Troparia]] of the Departed.\n\nThe Alleluia is intoned by the deacon (or the priest, if no deacon is available):\n\n:''Deacon:'' \"Alleluia, in the 8th tone: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their memory is from generation to generation.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their souls will dwell amid good things.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n\nOn Saturdays of the Dead, which are celebrated several times throughout the year, the [[prokeimenon]] at Vespers is also replaced with Alleluia, which is chanted in the following manner:\n\n:''Deacon:'' \"Alleluia, in the 8th tone.\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their memory is from generation to generation.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n\n====Other uses====\n[[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel readings]] are appointed for other services as well, particularly those in the [[Trebnik]]. A number of these are preceded by an Alleluia, in the same manner as that chanted at the Divine Liturgy, though sometimes there are no stichera (psalm verses).\n\nDuring the [[Sacred Mystery]] (Sacrament) of [[Baptism]], in addition to the Alleluia before the Gospel, the choir also chants an Alleluia while the priest pours the [[Oil of Catechumens]] into the [[baptismal font]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Alle Psallite Cum Luya]]''\n* [[Hallelujah]]\n* [[Eastertide]]\n* [[Gregorian chant]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Hoppin, Richard.

During this time, the word is added widely to verses and responses associated with prayers, to antiphons of psalms, and, during the [[Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of Easter and on Pentecost Sunday, to the dismissal at the end of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (\"[[Ite missa est]]\").\n\nOn the other hand, the word \"Alleluia\" is excluded from the Roman liturgy during [[Lent]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter II: The Structure Of The Mass, Its Elements, And Its Parts|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-2.cfm|website=General Instruction Of The Roman Missal|publisher=usccb.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> often euphemistically referred to during this time as the \"A-word\".<ref>https://www.dominicanajournal.org/the-a-word/</ref><ref>https://stmarymagdalenchoir.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/music-for-lent-%E2%80%93-understanding-the-solemnity-of-the-lenten-season/</ref><ref>https://anunslife.org/blog/nun-talk/lent-and-the-a-word</ref> In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite it is excluded also in the pre-Lenten [[Septuagesima]] period and in [[Requiem|Masses for the Dead]]. The same word, which normally follows the [[Gloria Patri]] at the beginning of each hour of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] and which in the present ordinary form of the Roman Rite is omitted during Lent, is replaced in pre-1970 forms by the phrase ''Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae'' (Praise to thee, O Lord, king of eternal glory) in Lent and the Septuagesima period.\n\nThe term \"Alleluia\" is used also to designate a chant beginning and ending with this word and including a verse of Scripture, in particular a chant to greet and welcome the Lord whose word will be proclaimed in the Gospel reading. The choir or a cantor sings \"Alleluia\". The congregation repeats this. The choir or cantor then sings a verse taken from the [[Lectionary|Mass Lectionary]] or the [[Roman Gradual]], after which the congregation again sings \"Alleluia\". In Lent the verse alone is sung or the word \"Alleluia\" is replaced by a different acclamation taken from the ''Gradual''. If singing is not used, the Alleluia and its verse may be omitted at any season.<ref>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 62\u221263]</ref><ref name=McNamara>[https://zenit.org/articles/liturgy-q-a-the-alleluia-before-the-gospel/ Edward McNamara, \"LITURGY Q & A: The Alleluia Before the Gospel'' in ZENIT, 6 June 2017]</ref><ref>[http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2011/feb/28/gospel-acclamation-during-lent/ Jeff Ostrowski, \"Gospel Acclamation During Lent\"]</ref>\n\nThe complex [[plainchant]] setting in the Roman Gradual requires a high degree of skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries.<ref name=McNamara/> This melismatic [[Gregorian chant]] opens with the cantor singing \"Alleluia\". The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long [[melisma]] called a [[jubilus]]. (The ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' notates the repeat with the Roman numeral \"ij\" (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings the main part of the verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an [[ambitus (music)|ambitus]] of only a [[perfect fifth]], a rather extreme example.\n\nAlleluias were frequently [[Trope (music)|troped]], both with added music and text. It is believed that some early Sequences derived from syllabic text being added to the jubilus, and may be named after the opening words of the Alleluia verse. Alleluias were also among the more frequently used chants to create early [[organum|organa]], such as in the [[Winchester Troper]].\n\nIn the pre-1970 form of the Roman-Rite Mass the Alleluia and its verse is replaced during Lent and Septuagesima time by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]]. On the other hand, during Eastertide the [[Gradual]] is replaced with an Alleluia chant, thus putting two such chants before the Gospel reading.\n\n==Eastern uses==\n===Byzantine rite===\n[[File:Alleluiarion.jpg|center|thumb|750x750px|Psalm 91 \u1fbf\u0391\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03be\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u1ff3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c8\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f40\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 with the alleluiaria in echos plagios tetartos (allelouia refrains written in red ink before the echos plagios section) in a kontakarion about 1300 ([[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|F-Pn]] fonds grec, Ms. [[#F-PnGr397|397]], f.43r)]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, after reading the Apostle (Epistle) at the [[Divine Liturgy]], the [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]] announces which of the [[Octoechos|Eight Tones]] the Alleluia is to be chanted in. The response of the choir is always the same: \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\" What differs is the tone in which it is sung, and the [[stichera]] (psalm verses) which are intoned by the Reader.\n\nThe Alleluia is paired with the [[Prokeimenon]] which preceded the reading of the Apostle. There may be either one or two Alleluias, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (there may be up to three readings from the Apostle, but never be more than two Prokeimena and Alleluia).\n\nIn the Russian/Slavic order, the Alleluia is intoned in one of the two following manners, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (The Antiochian/Byzantine practice is slightly different):\n\n====One Alleluia====\n:''Deacon:'' \"Let us attend.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the first sticheron of the Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Two Alleluias====\n:''Deacon:'' \"Let us attend.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone:\" Then he immediately chants the first sticheron of the first Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the first Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Reader:'' \"In the ____ Tone:\" And he chants the first sticheron of the second Alleluia.\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Lenten Alleluia====\nAmong the Orthodox, the chanting of Alleluia does not cease during Lent, as it does in the West. This is in accordance with the Orthodox approach to fasting, which is one of sober joy. During the weekdays of [[Great Lent]] and certain days during the lesser Lenten seasons ([[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], and [[Dormition Fast]]), the celebration of the Divine Liturgy on weekdays is not permitted. Instead, Alleluia is chanted at [[Matins]]. Since this chanting of Alleluia at Matins is characteristic of Lenten services, Lenten days are referred to as \"Days with Alleluia.\"\n\nThe Alleluia at Matins is not related to scripture readings or Prokeimena; instead, it replaces [[Theos Kyrios|\"God is the Lord...\"]] It is sung in the Tone of the Week and is followed by the Hymns to the Trinity (''Triadica'') in the same tone (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Use|Octoechos]] for an explanation of the eight-week cycle of tones).\n\n\"God is the Lord...\" would normally be intoned by the deacon, but since the deacon does not serve on days with Alleluia, it is intoned by the priest. He stands in front of the [[icon]] of Christ on the [[Iconostasis]], and says:\n\n:''Priest:'' \"Alleluia in the ____ Tone: Out of the night my spirit waketh at dawn unto Thee, O God, for Thy commandments are a light upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Zeal shall lay hold upon an uninstructed people.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n:''Priest:'' \"Add more evils upon them, O Lord, lay more evils upon them that are glorious upon the earth.\"\n:''Choir:'' \"Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\"\n\n====Alleluia for the departed====\nAlleluia is also chanted to a special melody at [[Christian burial|funerals]], [[Panikhida|memorial services]] (Greek: ''Parastas'', Slavonic: ''Panikhida''), and on [[Saturdays of the Dead]]. Again, it is chanted in place of \"God is the Lord...\", but this time is followed by the [[Troparia]] of the Departed.\n\nThe Alleluia is intoned by the deacon (or the priest, if no deacon is available):\n\n:''Deacon:'' \"Alleluia, in the 8th tone: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their memory is from generation to generation.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their souls will dwell amid good things.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n\nOn Saturdays of the Dead, which are celebrated several times throughout the year, the [[prokeimenon]] at Vespers is also replaced with Alleluia, which is chanted in the following manner:\n\n:''Deacon:'' \"Alleluia, in the 8th tone.\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n:''Deacon:'' \"Their memory is from generation to generation.\"\n:''Choir'': \"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\"\n\n====Other uses====\n[[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel readings]] are appointed for other services as well, particularly those in the [[Trebnik]]. A number of these are preceded by an Alleluia, in the same manner as that chanted at the Divine Liturgy, though sometimes there are no stichera (psalm verses).\n\nDuring the [[Sacred Mystery]] (Sacrament) of [[Baptism]], in addition to the Alleluia before the Gospel, the choir also chants an Alleluia while the priest pours the [[Oil of Catechumens]] into the [[baptismal font]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Alle Psallite Cum Luya]]''\n* [[Hallelujah]]\n* [[Eastertide]]\n* [[Gregorian chant]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Hoppin, Richard.

This condition is now more commonly called [[frontotemporal dementia]] by professionals, and the use of \"Pick's disease\" as a clinical diagnosis has fallen out of fashion. These two uses have previously led to confusion among professionals and patients.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of Pick's disease include difficulty in language and thinking, efforts to dissociate from family, behavioral changes, unwarranted anxiety, irrational fears, [[compulsive buying disorder]] (CBD or oniomania), impaired regulation of social conduct (e.g., breaches of etiquette, vulgar language, tactlessness, [[wikt:disinhibition|disinhibition]], misperception), passivity, low motivation ([[aboulia]]), inertia, overactivity, pacing, and wandering.<ref>Semple, David. \"Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry\".

PiD pathology is associated more with the frontotemporal dementia and [[progressive nonfluent aphasia]] subtypes than the [[semantic dementia]] subtype.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile other pathologies causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with a genetic cause, evidence is not conclusive in modern research on whether classical PiD pathology has or does not have a direct genetic link, or whether it has been shown to run in families or certain ethnic- or gender-specific subgroups. However, excess of a protein called \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in neural cells has been linked to neural degeneration. A buildup of A\u03b2 within cells causes inflammation, leading to cell destruction by the immune system.<ref>Carlson, Neil R. Physiology of Behavior. Eleventh ed. 543.

Pick bodies are almost always found in several places in the brain, including the [[dentate gyrus]], the pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector and subiculum of the [[hippocampus]], and the neocortex as well as a plurality of other nuclei. The location in the layers of the brain, as well as the anatomical placement, demonstrates some of the unique features of PiD. A striking feature is that in the neocortex the Pick bodies are in the II and IV layers of the cortex, which send neurons within the cortex and to thalamic synapses, respectively. While layers III and V have very few if any Pick bodies, they show extreme neuronal loss that can, in some cases, be so severe as to leave a void in the brain altogether. Other regions involved include the caudate, which is severely affected, the dorsomedial region of the [[putamen]], the [[globus pallidus]], and locus coeruleus.<ref name = Wang/> The hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus is also very severely affected. The cerebellar elements that are important in receiving input, including the mossy fibers and the monodendritic brush cells in the granule cell layer, and generating output signals, most notably the dentate nucleus, are stricken with tau protein inclusions. Strangely, the [[substantia nigra]] is most often uninvolved or only mildly involved, but cases of extreme degeneration do exist.<ref name = Wang/>\n\nPiD has several unique biochemical characteristics that allow for its identification as opposed to other pathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The most striking of these is that this disease, which has tau protein tangles present in many affected neurons, contains only one or as many as two of the six isoforms of the tau protein.<ref name = Ghetto>{{cite journal | last = Iskei | first = E |author2=Arai, H | title = Progress in the classification of non-Alzheimer-type degenerative dementias | journal = Psychogeriactrics | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u201342 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1479-8301.2006.00166.x}}</ref>  All of these isoforms result from alternative splicing of the same gene.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Arai | first = T |author2=Ikeda K |author3=Akiyama H |author4=Tsuchiya K |author5=Iritani S |author6=Ishiguro K |author7=Yagishita S |author8=Oda T |author9=Odawara T |author10=Iseki E. | title = Different immunoreactivities of the microtubule-binding region of tau and its molecular basis in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration | journal = Acta Neuropathol.| volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 489\u2013498 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12677450| doi = 10.1007/s00401-003-0671-8 }}</ref> Pick bodies typically have the 3R isoform of tau proteins as not only the most abundant form but the only form of this protein, but some studies have shown that a much greater number of tau isoforms including 4R and mixed 3R/4R can be present in the Pick bodies.<ref name = Munoz>{{cite journal | last = Munoz | first = DG |author2=Dickson DW |author3=Bergeron C |author4=Mackenzie IR |author5=Delacourte A |author6=Zhukareva V.  | title = The neuropathology and biochemistry of frontotemporal dementia | series = 54 | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = supp. S5 | issue = 1 | pages = S24\u2013S28 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12833365 | doi = 10.1002/ana.10571}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Ann Neurol|date=June 2002|volume=51|issue=6|pages=730\u20139|title=Sporadic Pick's disease: a tauopathy characterized by a spectrum of pathological tau isoforms in gray and white matter|authors=Zhukareva V1, Mann D, Pickering-Brown S, Uryu K, Shuck T, Shah K, Grossman M, Miller BL, Hulette CM, Feinstein SC, Trojanowski JQ, Lee VM|pmid=12112079|doi=10.1002/ana.10222}}</ref> Not only do these tangles have the 3R tau protein predominately, they are characteristically shaped with a round body; there is often an indentation in the area that faces the nucleus of the cell.\n\nThe Pick bodies are able to be labeled by N-terminal amyloid precursor protein segment, hyperphosphorylated tau, ubiquitin, Alz-50, neurofiliment proteins, clathrin, synaptophysin<ref name = Armstrong/> and neuronal surface glycoside (A2B5)<ref name = Munoz/> specific stains.

It is also known as '''Pick disease''' and '''PiD'''.

This condition is now more commonly called [[frontotemporal dementia]] by professionals, and the use of \"Pick's disease\" as a clinical diagnosis has fallen out of fashion. These two uses have previously led to confusion among professionals and patients.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of Pick's disease include difficulty in language and thinking, efforts to dissociate from family, behavioral changes, unwarranted anxiety, irrational fears, [[compulsive buying disorder]] (CBD or oniomania), impaired regulation of social conduct (e.g., breaches of etiquette, vulgar language, tactlessness, [[wikt:disinhibition|disinhibition]], misperception), passivity, low motivation ([[aboulia]]), inertia, overactivity, pacing, and wandering.<ref>Semple, David. \"Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry\". Oxford Press. 2005. p.143</ref> A characteristic of Pick\u2019s disease is that dysfunctional, argumentative, or hostile social conduct is initially exhibited towards family members and not initially exhibited in a workplace or neutral environment. <!-- Research published in the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology indicates that --> PiD is highly hereditary.<ref>American Academy of Neurology. \"Dementia: Rare Brain Disorder Is Highly Hereditary\". ScienceDaily, 4 November 2009.</ref> The changes in personality allow doctors to distinguish between PiD and [[Alzheimer disease]].<ref name=Medline>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000744|Pick disease}}</ref> Pick's disease is one of the causes of the clinical syndrome of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which has three subtypes. PiD pathology is associated more with the frontotemporal dementia and [[progressive nonfluent aphasia]] subtypes than the [[semantic dementia]] subtype.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile other pathologies causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with a genetic cause, evidence is not conclusive in modern research on whether classical PiD pathology has or does not have a direct genetic link, or whether it has been shown to run in families or certain ethnic- or gender-specific subgroups. However, excess of a protein called \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in neural cells has been linked to neural degeneration. A buildup of A\u03b2 within cells causes inflammation, leading to cell destruction by the immune system.<ref>Carlson, Neil R. Physiology of Behavior. Eleventh ed. 543.

Pick bodies are almost universally present in patients with PiD, but some new cases of atypical PiD have come to light that lack noticeable Pick bodies.<ref name = K>{{cite journal | last = Yamakawa | first = K |author2=Takanashi M |author3=Watanabe M |author4=Nakamura N |author5=Kobayashi T |author6=Hasegawa M |author7=Mizuno Y |author8=Tanaka S |author9=Mori H   | title = Pathological and biochemical studies on a case of Pick disease with severe white matter atrophy| journal = Neuropathology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 586\u2013591 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17203597 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00738.x }}</ref> A variety of stains can aid in the visualization of Pick bodies and Pick cells, but [[immunohistochemical staining]] using anti-tau and anti-[[ubiquitin]] [[antibodies]] have proven the most efficient and specific.<ref name = Armstrong>{{cite journal | last = Armstrong | first = RA | author2 = Cairns NJ, Lantos, PL | title = A comparison of histological and immunohistochemical methods for quantifying the pathological lesions of Pick's disease | journal = Neuropathology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295\u2013300 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1789.1998.tb00118.x}}</ref> [[Hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] staining allows visualization of another population of Pick cells, which are both tau and [[ubiquitin]] protein negative.

Pick bodies are almost always found in several places in the brain, including the [[dentate gyrus]], the pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector and subiculum of the [[hippocampus]], and the neocortex as well as a plurality of other nuclei. The location in the layers of the brain, as well as the anatomical placement, demonstrates some of the unique features of PiD. A striking feature is that in the neocortex the Pick bodies are in the II and IV layers of the cortex, which send neurons within the cortex and to thalamic synapses, respectively. While layers III and V have very few if any Pick bodies, they show extreme neuronal loss that can, in some cases, be so severe as to leave a void in the brain altogether. Other regions involved include the caudate, which is severely affected, the dorsomedial region of the [[putamen]], the [[globus pallidus]], and locus coeruleus.<ref name = Wang/> The hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus is also very severely affected. The cerebellar elements that are important in receiving input, including the mossy fibers and the monodendritic brush cells in the granule cell layer, and generating output signals, most notably the dentate nucleus, are stricken with tau protein inclusions. Strangely, the [[substantia nigra]] is most often uninvolved or only mildly involved, but cases of extreme degeneration do exist.<ref name = Wang/>\n\nPiD has several unique biochemical characteristics that allow for its identification as opposed to other pathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The most striking of these is that this disease, which has tau protein tangles present in many affected neurons, contains only one or as many as two of the six isoforms of the tau protein.<ref name = Ghetto>{{cite journal | last = Iskei | first = E |author2=Arai, H | title = Progress in the classification of non-Alzheimer-type degenerative dementias | journal = Psychogeriactrics | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u201342 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1479-8301.2006.00166.x}}</ref>  All of these isoforms result from alternative splicing of the same gene.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Arai | first = T |author2=Ikeda K |author3=Akiyama H |author4=Tsuchiya K |author5=Iritani S |author6=Ishiguro K |author7=Yagishita S |author8=Oda T |author9=Odawara T |author10=Iseki E. | title = Different immunoreactivities of the microtubule-binding region of tau and its molecular basis in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration | journal = Acta Neuropathol.| volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 489\u2013498 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12677450| doi = 10.1007/s00401-003-0671-8 }}</ref> Pick bodies typically have the 3R isoform of tau proteins as not only the most abundant form but the only form of this protein, but some studies have shown that a much greater number of tau isoforms including 4R and mixed 3R/4R can be present in the Pick bodies.<ref name = Munoz>{{cite journal | last = Munoz | first = DG |author2=Dickson DW |author3=Bergeron C |author4=Mackenzie IR |author5=Delacourte A |author6=Zhukareva V.  | title = The neuropathology and biochemistry of frontotemporal dementia | series = 54 | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = supp. S5 | issue = 1 | pages = S24\u2013S28 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12833365 | doi = 10.1002/ana.10571}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Ann Neurol|date=June 2002|volume=51|issue=6|pages=730\u20139|title=Sporadic Pick's disease: a tauopathy characterized by a spectrum of pathological tau isoforms in gray and white matter|authors=Zhukareva V1, Mann D, Pickering-Brown S, Uryu K, Shuck T, Shah K, Grossman M, Miller BL, Hulette CM, Feinstein SC, Trojanowski JQ, Lee VM|pmid=12112079|doi=10.1002/ana.10222}}</ref> Not only do these tangles have the 3R tau protein predominately, they are characteristically shaped with a round body; there is often an indentation in the area that faces the nucleus of the cell.\n\nThe Pick bodies are able to be labeled by N-terminal amyloid precursor protein segment, hyperphosphorylated tau, ubiquitin, Alz-50, neurofiliment proteins, clathrin, synaptophysin<ref name = Armstrong/> and neuronal surface glycoside (A2B5)<ref name = Munoz/> specific stains.

This is used clinically to determine whether a patient is suffering from AD or PiD.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe confirmatory diagnosis is made by brain biopsy, but other tests can be used to help, such as MRI, EEG, CT, and physical examination and history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000744.htm|title=Pick Disease|last=|first=|date=|website=Medline Plus|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nPick's disease, unfortunately, has a rapidly progressing, insidious course with steady deterioration over roughly 4 years.  This time can vary by individual, but many patients' quality of life decreases and fatality generally occurring (on average) 4 years from diagnosis.  No known cure exists for Pick's disease and many AD treatments have less utility in this patient population.<ref>Kaufman, David Myland MD. Clinical Neurology for Psychiatrists. 6th edition. 2007.

Other physicians may recommend a trial of a medication to improve mood symptoms, and cognitive exercises to attempt to slow decline.\n\n==History==\nPiD is named after [[Arnold Pick]], a professor of [[psychiatry]] from [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]] in [[Prague]], who first discovered and described the disease in 1892 by examining the brain tissue of several deceased patients with histories of [[dementia]].<ref name =Wang/><ref name = Armando>{{cite journal | last = Amano | first = N |author2=Iseki, E | title = Introduction: Pick's disease and frontotemporal dementia | journal = Neuropathology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 417\u2013421 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1789.1999.00258.x}}</ref> As a result, the characteristic histological feature of this disease\u2014a protein tangle that appears as a large body in neuronal tissue\u2014is named a Pick body.

Sahar, called \"the model block of Bhojpur\" by [Kalyan Mukherjee]] and [[Rajendra Singh Yadav]], benefited greatly from this development.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref> Peasants came to own [[tractors]], and [[literacy rates]] markedly increased. A saying of Sahar peasants at the time illustrates the improvement in standard of living at the time: ''\"Sahar [[Haryana]] ban gaya hai. Yaha koi admi bhook se naha marta.\"'' (In English, \"Sahar has become [[Haryana]]. No one dies of hunger here.\")<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref>\n\nHowever, continuing [[caste in India|caste]]-based tensions continued, causing significant unrest among lower-caste members. Corrupt upper-caste [[Bhumihar]] landlords would coerce lower-caste women who worked their lands into having sex with them; they also paid insufficient wages to their workers. These grievances led many peasants to gravitate towards [[socialism]] and particularly [[Naxalism]].<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nAlthough the grievances of the rural lower castes in Bhojpur were longstanding, the direct catalyst of the [[Bhojpur insurgency]] came during the [[1967 Indian general election]], when the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist]] politician [[Jagdish Mahto]] was attacked by upper-caste landlords in the village of [[Ekwari]], in Sahar block.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref> In the following years, Sahar block became a hotbed of conflict.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref><ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref> In 1970, the government of Bihar reported 26 [[murder|murders]] and 9 [[dacoity|dacoities]] that had been committed by Naxalites in the state, and in response strengthened the powers of the police department to deal with the Naxalites. However, the [[Naxalbari uprising]] in 1967 had drawn public attention away from the unrest in Bhojpur, so the district in particular was mostly ignored until 1973.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1973, a violent clash broke out between police and local peasants at the village of [[Chauri]], in Sahar block. An armed police posse arrived during the morning to arrest people suspected of stealing grain from a visiting trader. After encountering resistance from groups of farm workers, who declared that they would not allow any searches or arrests on their property, the police opened fire. Four villagers were killed, and nineteen of the policemen were injured. 36 people were arrested.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nThe Chauri incident drew media attention to the Naxalite movement in Bhojpur for the first time.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\">{{cite journal | title=Peasant Revolt in Bhojpur | author=Kalyan Mukherjee | journal=Economic and Political Weekly | volume= 14 | issue=36 | pages=1536\u20131538|jstor = 4367921|year = 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\n1975 was the bloodiest year of the Bhojpur insurgency. In Sahar, there were violent encounters at the villages of Dullamchak on 14 April, Bahuara on 2 July, and Bahubandh on 28 November. In 1977, landlords in the Sahar village of Gurpa killed several [[Harijans]], accusing them of being Naxalites.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nIn late 1977 and early 1978, members of the Bhojpur chapter of the [[Sangharsh Vahini]] visited three villages (Dullamchak, Bansidehri, and Bargaon) in Sahar block. They later published a report on their findings, and included a list of proposed reforms for the district's peasants:. The items included distribution of ''gairmazarua'' (common) land among landless peasants, distribution of surplus land according to the [[Ceilings Act]], peaceful resolution of wage disputes, establishment of local industries to supplement incomes for agricultural labourers, lifting of restrictions preventing Harijans from entering temples, and the removal of [[thanas]] and police camps from the villages.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nAlso in 1978, [[Karpoori Thakur]], then [[Chief Minister of Bihar]], assembled a four-man committee to investigate the Naxalite movement in Sahar. Results were published in August of that year. The report noted a recalcitrant mood in the surveyed villages of Karbasin and Korandehri and concluded that the movement consisted of lower-caste members retaliating against upper-caste ones for years of exploitation and injustice.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\">{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Arvind N. |title=Agrarian Movements in India: Studies on 20th Century Bihar |date=1982 |publisher=Frank Cass & Co. |location=London |pages=119-146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHt0DwAAQBAJ&dq |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn November and December 1978, there were attacks on members of the [[Ahir]] community who were seen as collaborators with [[Bhumihar]] and [[Rajput]] landlords in the village of [[Newada]], in Sahar block. Indian intelligence personnel viewed this as an important indicator of the class-based nature of the unrest in Bhojpur at the time.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n=== Sub-district ===\nIn 2001, the population of Sahar block was 99,585; this increased to 110,276 in 2011, an increase of 10.7%. This percent increase was the lowest among sub-districts in Bhojpur district during this period. In both Census years, Sahar was classified as an entirely rural sub-district, with no urban centers. The largest village was [[Ekwari]], with a population of 11,561.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nThe [[sex ratio]] of Sahar block in 2011 was 966 females to every 1000 males. This was the most even ratio among all sub-districts in Bhojpur (the average ratio was 907). Among the 0-6 age group, the sex ratio was slightly higher, at 971 females for every 1000 males; this ratio was also the highest among Bhojpur's sub-districts, where the average was 918.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nIn 2011, 22,826 people, or 20.7% of the sub-district's population, belonged to [[scheduled castes]] in Sahar block. This was slightly higher than the average of 15.59% in all of Bhojpur district. There were only 75 members of [[scheduled tribes]] in the block, or 0.07% of the population, which was slightly lower than the 0.51% in all of Bhojpur district.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nIn 2011, the total [[literacy rate]] of Sahar block was 67.09%, which was slightly below the Bhojpur district average of 69.16%. In the block, 79.77% of men and 53.95% of women could read and write. The gender gap in literacy was 25.82%, which was about average for the district as a whole.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nThe primary means of employment for Sahar block's workers in 2011 was [[agriculture]], with over 80% of the population engaged in some form of agricultural work. 29.03% of workers were cultivators who owned or leased their own land, and 52.39% were agricultural labourers who worked someone else's land for wages. Both percentages were somewhat higher than the averages for all of Bhojpur district (23% and 44%, respectively). Household industry workers constituted 3.32% of Sahar block's workforce, and all other workers made up the remaining 15.26%.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n86.0% of the total land area in Sahar block was under cultivation in 2011. Of the land under cultivation, 93.53% was [[Irrigation in India|irrigated]], which was the highest percentage in Bhojpur district.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nOf the 51 inhabited villages in Sahar sub-district in 2011, all had access to clean [[drinking water]], and 47 had schools. 14 had medical facilities, 17 had [[post offices]], 9 had [[telephone]] access, 18 had transport communications ([[bus]], [[Rail transport|rail]], or navigable waterways), 8 had [[bank|banks]], 21 had [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca roads]], and 3 had [[National Grid (India)|electrical power]]. Only one village, that of Sahar, had an [[Agricultural credit society|agricultural credit society]]. Sahar block had the lowest proportion of villages with telephone service (17.65%) among sub-districts of Bhojpur (where the average was 54.76%). The proportion of villages with pucca roads, 41.18%, was also the lowest in Bhojpur, where the average was 70.61%. The proportion of villages with electricity was 5.88% in Sahar block, which was the second-lowest among sub-districts in Bhojpur, where the average was 42.13%; only [[Agiaon]] had a lower proportion of villages with electricity. Additionally, only two villages (Ekwari and Fatehpur) had [[Internet]] access in Sahar block in 2011.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n=== Village of Sahar ===\nThe village of Sahar covered an area of 355 [[hectares]] and had a population of 5,674 in 2011. It had one each of a [[pre-primary school]], [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[secondary school]], and [[senior secondary school]], but did not have any form of [[post-secondary school]]. There was one [[community healthcare centre]] in the village, and two practitioners of [[traditional Indian medicine|traditional medicine]]. The village had access to [[tap water]], but did not have [[public toilets]]. There was a post office. The village had bus service and use of [[automobiles]] and [[tractors]], as well as a river [[ferry]] service, but no [[railway station]]. The town had pucca roads, which were not connected to [[National highways in India|national highways]], although they were connected to [[State highway (India)|state highways]]. Sahar had a bank with an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], as well as the only agricultural credit society in the sub-district. There was a [[mandi]], or regular market open daily, as well as a weekly [[haat]] market.

Sahar, called \"the model block of Bhojpur\" by [Kalyan Mukherjee]] and [[Rajendra Singh Yadav]], benefited greatly from this development.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref> Peasants came to own [[tractors]], and [[literacy rates]] markedly increased. A saying of Sahar peasants at the time illustrates the improvement in standard of living at the time: ''\"Sahar [[Haryana]] ban gaya hai. Yaha koi admi bhook se naha marta.\"'' (In English, \"Sahar has become [[Haryana]]. No one dies of hunger here.\")<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref>\n\nHowever, continuing [[caste in India|caste]]-based tensions continued, causing significant unrest among lower-caste members. Corrupt upper-caste [[Bhumihar]] landlords would coerce lower-caste women who worked their lands into having sex with them; they also paid insufficient wages to their workers. These grievances led many peasants to gravitate towards [[socialism]] and particularly [[Naxalism]].<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nAlthough the grievances of the rural lower castes in Bhojpur were longstanding, the direct catalyst of the [[Bhojpur insurgency]] came during the [[1967 Indian general election]], when the [[Socialist Party (India)|Socialist]] politician [[Jagdish Mahto]] was attacked by upper-caste landlords in the village of [[Ekwari]], in Sahar block.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref> In the following years, Sahar block became a hotbed of conflict.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref><ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref> In 1970, the government of Bihar reported 26 [[murder|murders]] and 9 [[dacoity|dacoities]] that had been committed by Naxalites in the state, and in response strengthened the powers of the police department to deal with the Naxalites. However, the [[Naxalbari uprising]] in 1967 had drawn public attention away from the unrest in Bhojpur, so the district in particular was mostly ignored until 1973.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1973, a violent clash broke out between police and local peasants at the village of [[Chauri]], in Sahar block. An armed police posse arrived during the morning to arrest people suspected of stealing grain from a visiting trader. After encountering resistance from groups of farm workers, who declared that they would not allow any searches or arrests on their property, the police opened fire. Four villagers were killed, and nineteen of the policemen were injured. 36 people were arrested.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nThe Chauri incident drew media attention to the Naxalite movement in Bhojpur for the first time.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\">{{cite journal | title=Peasant Revolt in Bhojpur | author=Kalyan Mukherjee | journal=Economic and Political Weekly | volume= 14 | issue=36 | pages=1536\u20131538|jstor = 4367921|year = 1979}}</ref><ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\n1975 was the bloodiest year of the Bhojpur insurgency. In Sahar, there were violent encounters at the villages of Dullamchak on 14 April, Bahuara on 2 July, and Bahubandh on 28 November. In 1977, landlords in the Sahar village of Gurpa killed several [[Harijans]], accusing them of being Naxalites.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nIn late 1977 and early 1978, members of the Bhojpur chapter of the [[Sangharsh Vahini]] visited three villages (Dullamchak, Bansidehri, and Bargaon) in Sahar block. They later published a report on their findings, and included a list of proposed reforms for the district's peasants:. The items included distribution of ''gairmazarua'' (common) land among landless peasants, distribution of surplus land according to the [[Ceilings Act]], peaceful resolution of wage disputes, establishment of local industries to supplement incomes for agricultural labourers, lifting of restrictions preventing Harijans from entering temples, and the removal of [[thanas]] and police camps from the villages.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\"></ref>\n\nAlso in 1978, [[Karpoori Thakur]], then [[Chief Minister of Bihar]], assembled a four-man committee to investigate the Naxalite movement in Sahar. Results were published in August of that year. The report noted a recalcitrant mood in the surveyed villages of Karbasin and Korandehri and concluded that the movement consisted of lower-caste members retaliating against upper-caste ones for years of exploitation and injustice.<ref name=\"Agrarian Movements\">{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Arvind N. |title=Agrarian Movements in India: Studies on 20th Century Bihar |date=1982 |publisher=Frank Cass & Co. |location=London |pages=119-146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHt0DwAAQBAJ&dq |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn November and December 1978, there were attacks on members of the [[Ahir]] community who were seen as collaborators with [[Bhumihar]] and [[Rajput]] landlords in the village of [[Newada]], in Sahar block. Indian intelligence personnel viewed this as an important indicator of the class-based nature of the unrest in Bhojpur at the time.<ref name=\"Peasant Revolt\"></ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n=== Sub-district ===\nIn 2001, the population of Sahar block was 99,585; this increased to 110,276 in 2011, an increase of 10.7%. This percent increase was the lowest among sub-districts in Bhojpur district during this period. In both Census years, Sahar was classified as an entirely rural sub-district, with no urban centers. The largest village was [[Ekwari]], with a population of 11,561.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nThe [[sex ratio]] of Sahar block in 2011 was 966 females to every 1000 males. This was the most even ratio among all sub-districts in Bhojpur (the average ratio was 907). Among the 0-6 age group, the sex ratio was slightly higher, at 971 females for every 1000 males; this ratio was also the highest among Bhojpur's sub-districts, where the average was 918.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nIn 2011, 22,826 people, or 20.7% of the sub-district's population, belonged to [[scheduled castes]] in Sahar block. This was slightly higher than the average of 15.59% in all of Bhojpur district. There were only 75 members of [[scheduled tribes]] in the block, or 0.07% of the population, which was slightly lower than the 0.51% in all of Bhojpur district.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nIn 2011, the total [[literacy rate]] of Sahar block was 67.09%, which was slightly below the Bhojpur district average of 69.16%. In the block, 79.77% of men and 53.95% of women could read and write. The gender gap in literacy was 25.82%, which was about average for the district as a whole.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nThe primary means of employment for Sahar block's workers in 2011 was [[agriculture]], with over 80% of the population engaged in some form of agricultural work. 29.03% of workers were cultivators who owned or leased their own land, and 52.39% were agricultural labourers who worked someone else's land for wages. Both percentages were somewhat higher than the averages for all of Bhojpur district (23% and 44%, respectively). Household industry workers constituted 3.32% of Sahar block's workforce, and all other workers made up the remaining 15.26%.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n86.0% of the total land area in Sahar block was under cultivation in 2011. Of the land under cultivation, 93.53% was [[Irrigation in India|irrigated]], which was the highest percentage in Bhojpur district.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\nOf the 51 inhabited villages in Sahar sub-district in 2011, all had access to clean [[drinking water]], and 47 had schools. 14 had medical facilities, 17 had [[post offices]], 9 had [[telephone]] access, 18 had transport communications ([[bus]], [[Rail transport|rail]], or navigable waterways), 8 had [[bank|banks]], 21 had [[Indian vernacular architecture#Pukka|pucca roads]], and 3 had [[National Grid (India)|electrical power]]. Only one village, that of Sahar, had an [[Agricultural credit society|agricultural credit society]]. Sahar block had the lowest proportion of villages with telephone service (17.65%) among sub-districts of Bhojpur (where the average was 54.76%). The proportion of villages with pucca roads, 41.18%, was also the lowest in Bhojpur, where the average was 70.61%. The proportion of villages with electricity was 5.88% in Sahar block, which was the second-lowest among sub-districts in Bhojpur, where the average was 42.13%; only [[Agiaon]] had a lower proportion of villages with electricity. Additionally, only two villages (Ekwari and Fatehpur) had [[Internet]] access in Sahar block in 2011.<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n=== Village of Sahar ===\nThe village of Sahar covered an area of 355 [[hectares]] and had a population of 5,674 in 2011. It had one each of a [[pre-primary school]], [[primary school]], [[middle school]], [[secondary school]], and [[senior secondary school]], but did not have any form of [[post-secondary school]]. There was one [[community healthcare centre]] in the village, and two practitioners of [[traditional Indian medicine|traditional medicine]]. The village had access to [[tap water]], but did not have [[public toilets]]. There was a post office. The village had bus service and use of [[automobiles]] and [[tractors]], as well as a river [[ferry]] service, but no [[railway station]]. The town had pucca roads, which were not connected to [[National highways in India|national highways]], although they were connected to [[State highway (India)|state highways]]. Sahar had a bank with an [[ATM]], as well as the only agricultural credit society in the sub-district. There was a [[mandi]], or regular market open daily, as well as a weekly [[haat]] market. The village had [[newspaper]] distribution but it did not have a [[public library]] or any sort of [[electricity]].<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n== Villages ==\nThe sub-district of Sahar contains 51 inhabited villages and 5 uninhabited ones, for a total of 56 villages:<ref name=\"Census 2011\"></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n\n|-\n!

The original game was released in 1988, and an electronic talking version was sold starting in 1989. [[Milton Bradley]] updated the game in 1996 with a new design, and another updated version was released in 2004.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe game was designed for players aged 9 and up. The targeted consumer was teenage girls, usually 11 to 16 years old. Milton Bradley made several [[commercials]] for the game. In one from 1990 the camera showed alternating shots of four girls shopping in a real mall, and playing the game at home.

For a more challenging game play, the goal could be increased up to ten items in the 1989 and 1996 editions.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game takes place on a board representing a two-story [[mall]]. The game is designed for two to four players. Each player receives $150 ($200 in previous versions) from one player who is designated to be the banker. The banker dispenses cash in the following manner; one $50 bill (two in previous versions), three $20 bills, three $10 bills, and two $5 bills. The first player presses the computer's gameplay button, which directs the player to move a random number of spaces. When arriving at a store, each player can make purchases with a cardboard credit card, and the computer tracks the game play. After the player purchases items with the credit card he/she will pay the banker with the appropriate amount of cash. At the start of each turn, an electronic voice announces a clearance at one store and sales at two others. Players can use these sales to their advantage since it takes up a turn to get to the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].\n\nAt random intervals, a player may be given a clearance or a sale at a store that does not currently have one. Other times, a player may have to pay an additional fee for the item.\n\nSometimes, the game will refuse a sale, or will refuse to dispense more cash. Occasionally, the game will randomly instruct players to move to the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], the [[Arcade|arcade,]] [[restrooms]], or to various stores.\n\nOnce a player gets six of the items on their list, they must be the first to reach their respective parking lot (1989 and 1996) or final destination (which may change at any time). The first person to accomplish this wins the [[Game|game.]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{bgg|15162|''Mall Madness''|5086|''Electronic Mall Madness''}}\n*[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/MallMadness.pdf ''Mall Madness'' instructions] at Hasbro.com\n*[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Mall_Madness_Electronic.pdf Electronic ''Mall Madness'' instructions] at Hasbro.com\n*[http://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad2613e1c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/FD1FE6F619B9F36910E8712E7CB0C532.pdf ''Mall Madness'': \"The Littlest Pet Shop\" instructions] at Hasbro.com\n\n{{Hasbro}}\n\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Children's board games]]\n[[Category:Milton Bradley Company games]]\n[[Category:Roll-and-move board games]]\n[[Category:Electronic board games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=February 2016}}\n{{advert|date=March 2014}}\n}}\n{{italic title}}\n\n'''''Mall Madness''''' is a shopping themed [[board game]] released by [[Milton Bradley]] (later versions are titled as '''''[[Electronic Mall Madness]]''''').

The targeted consumer was teenage girls, usually 11 to 16 years old. Milton Bradley made several [[commercials]] for the game. In one from 1990 the camera showed alternating shots of four girls shopping in a real mall, and playing the game at home.
