Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

[[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed both films, and [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] are part of the cast. The first film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was released in November 2004 and received acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The second film, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released in June 2018, received mostly positive reviews and set the record for best opening weekend for an animated film with $183 million. The series has grossed a combined $1.8 billion worldwide.\n\nThe franchise takes place in a [[fictional universe]] where superheroes known as \"Supers\" co-exist with society and are occasionally forced into action despite a ban issued on them by the Government.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===\n{{main|The Incredibles}}\nA family of superheroes, while trying to live a quiet suburban life after superheroes are deemed illegal, are forced into action to save the world.\n\n===''Incredibles 2'' (2018)===\n{{main|Incredibles 2}}\nIn an effort to reinstate the public's trust in superheroes, Helen (Elastigirl) is chosen by a telecommunications corporation to pull off a publicity stunt while her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for their kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack.\n\n==Short films==\n===''Jack-Jack Attack'' (2005)===\n{{Main|Jack-Jack Attack}}\nA short film was released on March 15, 2005 on the first film's DVD release, entitled ''Jack-Jack Attack.'' Bird returned to write and direct the short. It was originally conceived to be part of the first film, but decided to make it into a short. The short takes place during the events of the first film and follows Kari as she babysits Jack-Jack while discovering his newly awakened superpowers in the process.\n\n===''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' (2005)===\n{{main|Mr. Incredible and Pals}}\nAnother short film titled ''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' was also included on the first film's DVD release. The short is presented as an episode of a 1960s animated series which is animated in the style of [[Syncro-Vox]] (an animation technique famously used ''[[Clutch Cargo]]''). It follows Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and their rabbit pal Mister Skipperdoo's attempt to prevent a bridge from being destroyed. [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] appear in character as Mr. Incredible and Frozone respectively in the short's commentary track.\n\n===''Auntie Edna'' (2018)===\n\nA short film entitled '' Auntie Edna'' was released on October 23, 2018 included with the digital release of ''Incredibles 2''  and on November 6, 2018 with the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. In a similar manner to ''Jack-Jack Attack'', the short follows Edna during the events of ''Incredibles 2'' as she babysits Jack-Jack while coping with his newly discovered powers.\n\n==Video games==\n===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===\n{{main|The Incredibles (video game)}}\nA video game developed by [[Heavy Iron Studios]] and published by [[THQ]] based on the [[The Incredibles|2004 film]] was released on October 31, 2004 for [[PlayStation 2]], [[mobile phone]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\n===''The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer'' (2005)===\n {{main|The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer}}\nA video game presented as a direct continuation of ''The Incredibles'' (until ''Incredibles 2'' rendered it non-canon), released in October 24, 2005 for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Xbox, once again developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ. The game takes place after the events of the film and follows Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they face off against the Underminer as he prepares his attack on the Earth's surface.\n\n===''Lego The Incredibles'' (2018)===\n{{main|Lego The Incredibles}}\nA [[Lego]] video game adaptation based on the events of the first two films was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] on June 15, 2018 for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] coinciding with the release of ''Incredibles 2''.\n\n===Other miscellaneous titles===\n''The Incredibles'' have made appearances in other Disney-related video games, including ''[[The Incredibles: When Danger Calls]]'',\nA PC game featuring several minigames released in 2004. They also appeared in all three ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' games in which characters from the films appear as playable characters, with [[Disney Infinity (video game)|the first game]] featuring a play set based on the franchise, and ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney\u2013Pixar Adventure]]'' for [[Xbox 360]], Xbox One, and [[Windows 10]], which includes missions from various Pixar films including ''The Incredibles''.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Theatrical films\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Short films\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Video game\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[The Incredibles]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Jack-Jack Attack]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Mr. Incredible and Pals]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''Auntie Edna''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer|{{small|The Incredibles:}}<br />Rise the Underminer]]''\n|-\n! 2004\n! 2018\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2005\n! 2018\n! 2005\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Bob Parr<br />{{small|Mr. Incredible}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | [[Craig T.

[[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed both films, and [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] are part of the cast. The first film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was released in November 2004 and received acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The second film, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released in June 2018, received mostly positive reviews and set the record for best opening weekend for an animated film with $183 million. The series has grossed a combined $1.8 billion worldwide.\n\nThe franchise takes place in a [[fictional universe]] where superheroes known as \"Supers\" co-exist with society and are occasionally forced into action despite a ban issued on them by the Government.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===\n{{main|The Incredibles}}\nA family of superheroes, while trying to live a quiet suburban life after superheroes are deemed illegal, are forced into action to save the world.\n\n===''Incredibles 2'' (2018)===\n{{main|Incredibles 2}}\nIn an effort to reinstate the public's trust in superheroes, Helen (Elastigirl) is chosen by a telecommunications corporation to pull off a publicity stunt while her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for their kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack.\n\n===Future films===\nFollowing the release of ''Incredibles 2'', director [[Brad Bird]] acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird\u2019s film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\"<ref name=EW/> Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles. \"I wouldn't ever rule it out,\" said producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] of a potential third film. \"And if past is prologue, it'll be another 14 years \u2014 and a lot of people will probably need oxygen to make a third one.\"<ref name=EW>{{citeweb|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/|title=Could there be an Incredibles 3?

Bird returned to write and direct the short. It was originally conceived to be part of the first film, but decided to make it into a short. The short takes place during the events of the first film and follows Kari as she babysits Jack-Jack while discovering his newly awakened superpowers in the process.\n\n===''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' (2005)===\n{{main|Mr. Incredible and Pals}}\nAnother short film titled ''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' was also included on the first film's DVD release. The short is presented as an episode of a 1960s animated series which is animated in the style of [[Syncro-Vox]] (an animation technique famously used ''[[Clutch Cargo]]''). It follows Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and their rabbit pal Mister Skipperdoo's attempt to prevent a bridge from being destroyed. [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] appear in character as Mr. Incredible and Frozone respectively in the short's commentary track.\n\n===''Auntie Edna'' (2018)===\n\nA short film entitled '' Auntie Edna'' was released on October 23, 2018 included with the digital release of ''Incredibles 2''  and on November 6, 2018 with the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. In a similar manner to ''Jack-Jack Attack'', the short follows Edna during the events of ''Incredibles 2'' as she babysits Jack-Jack while coping with his newly discovered powers.\n\n==Video games==\n===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===\n{{main|The Incredibles (video game)}}\nA video game developed by [[Heavy Iron Studios]] and published by [[THQ]] based on the [[The Incredibles|2004 film]] was released on October 31, 2004 for [[PlayStation 2]], [[mobile phone]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\n===''The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer'' (2005)===\n {{main|The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer}}\nA video game presented as a direct continuation of ''The Incredibles'' (until ''Incredibles 2'' rendered it non-canon), released in October 24, 2005 for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Xbox, once again developed by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ. The game takes place after the events of the film and follows Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they face off against the Underminer as he prepares his attack on the Earth's surface.\n\n===''Lego The Incredibles'' (2018)===\n{{main|Lego The Incredibles}}\nA [[Lego]] video game adaptation based on the events of the first two films was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] on June 15, 2018 for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] coinciding with the release of ''Incredibles 2''.\n\n===Other miscellaneous titles===\n''The Incredibles'' have made appearances in other Disney-related video games, including ''[[The Incredibles: When Danger Calls]]'',\nA PC game featuring several minigames released in 2004. They also appeared in all three ''[[Disney Infinity]]'' games in which characters from the films appear as playable characters, with [[Disney Infinity (video game)|the first game]] featuring a play set based on the franchise, and ''[[Kinect Rush: A Disney\u2013Pixar Adventure]]'' for [[Xbox 360]], Xbox One, and [[Windows 10]], which includes missions from various Pixar films including ''The Incredibles''.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Theatrical films\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Short films\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | Video game\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[The Incredibles]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Jack-Jack Attack]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[Mr. Incredible and Pals]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''Auntie Edna''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12%;\" | ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer|{{small|The Incredibles:}}<br />Rise the Underminer]]''\n|-\n! 2004\n! 2018\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2005\n! 2018\n! 2005\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Bob Parr<br />{{small|Mr. Incredible}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | [[Craig T.

Ferries have been used on this route since at least the 12th century, and continue to be popular for both local people and visitors.\n\nThe current fleet consists of two vessels. A third ferry, ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Royal Daffodil]]'' was in service until 2012. The current ferries originally came into service in the 1960s and were named ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. Both ferries have been extensively refurbished and renamed ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' and ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]''.  The ferries share the workload of cross-river ferrying, charter cruises and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] cruise. The service is operated by [[Merseytravel]], under the \u201c'''Mersey Ferries'''\u201d brand.\n\n==History==\n===Medieval ferries===\nIn about 1150, the [[Birkenhead Priory|Benedictine Priory]] at [[Birkenhead]] was established.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1019159|desc=Birkenhead Priory|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river. At this time, the Mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to [[Ainsdale]] beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near Otterspool. The only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the Pool, near the site of the present Merseyside Police headquarters. Weather often stopped crossings and passengers were delayed for days, taking shelter at the priory.\n\nIn 1317, a royal licence was issued, granting permission to the Priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]]. [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] visited Liverpool in 1323, and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to [[Ince, Cheshire|Ince]]. In 1330, his son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: ''\"the right of ferry there\u2026 for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls\"''. At the time, there was only a small hamlet at Birkenhead, and a slightly larger village at Liverpool.<ref name=bri2e>{{citation|url=http://www.bri2e.co.uk/places/woodside/intro.htm|title=Woodside Ferry, Birkenhead|first=Brian|last=Tuohey|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Chester Indictments record criminal activities on the Mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In 1355, Richard, son of Simon de Becheton, was murdered on the ferry; the murderers escaped and took refuge at [[Shotwick]]. In 1365, it was recorded that there were four ferryboats operating without a licence, from [[Bromborough]] and Eastham. In 1414, William de Stanley, the servant of John Talbot, later [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], was on the ferry between Birkenhead and Liverpool when about 200 men assaulted him, and stole his bay horse valued at \u00a35 (current value - over \u00a32,800), a bow and 14 arrows valued at 3s 4d (current value - over \u00a395) and a barge valued at \u00a310 (current value - over \u00a35,700). The thieves were fined.<ref name=Hardman>{{citation|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.31&chapterId=152|title=Ferries across the Mersey: Early history of Mersey ferries|publisher=E.

The licence then passed to the [[Abbey of St Werburgh]], in [[Chester]], and became known as Job's Ferry. Early ferries also existed across the Mersey further upstream, at Ince and at [[Runcorn]].\n[[File:Liverpool-1911.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Map from 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, showing ferry routes]]\n\n===From the 16th to the 18th century===\nThe monks of Birkenhead Priory operated a ferry service until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the priory's destruction by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] troops in 1536. Ownership reverted to the Crown, and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the Priory properties were bought by Ralph Worsley of Lancashire for \u00a3586. 11s. 6d (current value - almost \u00a3205,000).  The rights later passed to the [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] family. By 1541 William Bromley had the licence for ferries at Seacombe, and in 1586, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] granted John Poole of [[Great Sutton|Sutton]] the rights at [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere]].<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships. The use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed, but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather. The Mersey is famed for its thick fogs, and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate. The frequency depended on demand and the weather.\n\nBy the 18th century, the commercial expansion of Liverpool and the increase in [[stage coach]] traffic from [[Chester]] spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river.<ref name=\"Hardman Woodside and the Mersey ferries\">{{citation|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.31&chapterId=154|title=Ferries across the Mersey: Woodside and the Mersey ferries|publisher=E.

By 1753 the Cheshire side of the Mersey had at least five ferry houses at Ince, Eastham, the Rock, Woodside and Seacombe. The service from [[New Ferry]] to Liverpool was first mentioned in 1774.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\n===Steam ferries===\nThe first [[steam ships|steamship]] to operate on the Mersey was the ''Elizabeth'', a wooden paddle steamer, which was introduced in 1815 to operate between Liverpool and Runcorn.<ref name=museums>{{citation|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/displayGuide.aspx?sid=33&serStr=&sorStr=s_no%20ASC%200&pgeInt=0&catStr= |title=Liverpool Maritime Archives & Library Information Sheet|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>  There was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel. For the steam ferry ''Etna'', which entered service at Tranmere on 17 April 1817, the idea of extension stages was mooted. These were long piers that were mounted on wheels and, by using a steam engine, could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide.\n\nAt Woodside, a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth, and in 1822 the paddle steamer ''Royal Mail'' began commercial operation between Liverpool and Woodside.<ref name=\"museums\"/> The town of Birkenhead was just starting to develop at this point. In 1820, the Birkenhead Ferry began operating from a new site just to the south; this closed in 1870. The Woodside, North Birkenhead and Liverpool Steam Ferry Company was formed in 1835, and the slipway at Woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier. In 1838, the Monks Ferry Company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of Woodside, but this service closed in 1878.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nFrom about 1830, steam ferries also operated from the new [[seaside resort|resort]] developed by James Atherton at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], and from nearby [[Egremont, Merseyside|Egremont]]. Steam ferries also began operating from Eastham.\n\nBy the 1840s, Birkenhead was developing into a busy new town. The [[Chester and Birkenhead Railway|railway to Chester]] had opened, the town was growing quickly, and the docks were under construction. There were also competing ferry services and disputes over the rights granted to the monks, and there was a need to improve the facilities at Woodside. In the early 1840s, the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end. However, this soon became inadequate.<ref name=\"bri2e\"/>\n\nIn 1847, the first floating landing stage, which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time, was opened at Liverpool. The first portion, known as the Georges' landing stage, was designed by [[William Cubitt]] and was 500 feet long. It was rebuilt and extended in 1874.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Liverpool|volume=16|page=808|first=William Fergusson |last=Irvine}}</ref>\n\n===The Corporation Years===\nUntil the establishment of the [[Mersey Railway]] in 1886, the ferries were the only means of crossing the river, and so all of the routes were heavily used. All of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under [[municipal]] ownership in the mid 19th century. The Woodside ferry was taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners in 1858 and, in 1861, the Wallasey Local Board took over the ferry services at Seacombe, Egremont and New Brighton. At Woodside, land between the Woodside Hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed, and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened. The pontoons were towed into position, moored by chains originally made for the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], and linked to the mainland by two double bridges.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nThe ''Cheshire'', the first passenger ferry steamer to have a saloon, operated from Woodside in 1864. The iron pier at Eastham was built in 1874. On 26 November 1878, the ferry ''Gem'', a paddle steamer operated from Seacombe by the Wallasey Local Board, collided with the ''Bowfell'', a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the River Mersey; five people died as a result.\n\nIn 1886 the [[Mersey Railway Tunnel]] was opened, providing competition for the ferry services. The Woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890, which replaced [[paddle steamers]]. In 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day.<ref name=\"museums\"/> The ferry service at Tranmere, which had operated since mediaeval times, closed in 1897. The pier and landing stage at Rock Ferry was built in 1899, and Birkenhead Corporation also operated the ferry service at New Ferry.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nIn 1914 [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] travelled on the ferry ''S.S. Daffodil'' from Wallasey to Liverpool. During the [[First World War]] the steamers ''Iris'' and ''Daffodil'' were taken out of service from Wallasey to be used as troop ships in the [[Zeebrugge Raid|naval raid on Zeebrugge]] in Belgium. The ferries had a shallow draft, allowing them to skim over the [[Naval mine|mines]] floating beneath the surface, and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] curling into the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-special-features/2008/03/15/how-the-mersey-ferries-helped-win-the-first-world-war-64375-20627075/ |title=How the Mersey Ferries helped win the First World War|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|date=15 March 2008|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref> They both saw action, which was described on 24 April 1918 by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Vice\u2013Admiral Sir Roger Keyes]] of the [[Royal Navy]] in a message to the ferries' manager:\n<blockquote>\n''\"I am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried Bluejackets and Marines to Zeebrugge, and remained alongside the Mole for an hour, greatly contributing to the success of the operation... The damage caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired\"''.\n</blockquote>\nBecause of their work King George V allowed the vessels to use the word ''\"Royal\"'' in their name. They needed extensive refitting before they could resume peacetime activities.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nIn the boats themselves, there was quick development. The early incarnations of today's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships, mainly the 1906 pair, ''Royal Iris'' and ''Royal Daffodil''. The Wallasey [[twin screw steamer|twin screw]] vessels all had [[flying bridge]]s with port and starboard docking cabs. As built, the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level, however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level. They were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], which is about the same as today's trio of ferries. On early paddlers, the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam, and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different. Birkenhead did not use flying bridges, instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level. Wallasey ferries employed a funnel [[livery]] of white and black and Birkenhead red and black. Birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war.\n\nWhen the railway tunnels were constructed and opened, the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular. It was really the advent of the road tunnels that caused trouble. When the [[Queensway road tunnel]] opened in 1934, the ferry service from Seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry. The opening of the road tunnel also had an effect on the luggage boats which were introduced in 1879. Both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats, which carried vehicles and goods across the river. When the road tunnel opened, traffic dropped by 80%. By the 1940s, luggage boat services from both Woodside and Seacombe to Liverpool had ceased.\n\nDue to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage, Birkenhead Corporation gradually closed its southern terminals; New Ferry (officially) on 22 September 1927, Eastham in 1929 and Rock Ferry on 30 June 1939. The closure of Eastham marked the last use of ferry [[paddle steamers]] on the river.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\">{{citation|title=Mersey Ferries - Volume 1|first=TB|last=Maund|publisher=Transport Publishing Co. Ltd|year=1991|isbn=0-86317-166-4}}</ref> Wallasey were always trying to close Egremont, but faced stiff opposition from locals who got petitions to keep the ferry open. The chance came to close Egremont during the [[Second World War]] for economical reasons, after the pier was damaged in a collision. This was in similar circumstances to the demise of New Ferry twenty years earlier. As a result, the Egremont service never reopened.\n\nIn 1941, mines which had drifted into the River Mersey stopped ferry crossings. The ''Oxton'' and ''Bebington'' vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload United States aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the Liverpool landing stage. The ''Upton'' vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in Liverpool Bay.\n\nIn 1950, the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year, including 11 million on the Woodside ferries and 15 million on Seacombe ferries, but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million. Night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956.\n\n===The MPTE takes over===\n[[File:Snowdrop at irlam locks on manchester ship canal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' at Irlam Locks on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]]]\nAs a result of the [[Transport Act 1968]], both Wallasey and Birkenhead Corporations merged under the single control of the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (MPTE) on 1 December 1969.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" />  By this time, New Brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage, the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971, with the stage and pier subsequently demolished.\n\nIn spite of the close proximity of Wallasey and Birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages, both Corporations had used different gangway spacing on their vessels. This meant that a Wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at Birkenhead's terminal at Woodside, and that a Birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at Seacombe and New Brighton. The Pier Head at Liverpool was obliged to have gangways to suit both sets of ships. When the combined ferry fleet was rationalised, Seacombe Ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the Birkenhead vessels.\n\nThe 1970s economic situation in Britain saw costs escalating, with funding limited by the MPTE, which was embarking on an expensive operation to construct the [[Merseyrail]] \"Liverpool Loop\" extension. Compounded with the opening of the [[Kingsway Tunnel|Kingsway road tunnel]] on 28 June 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers (only 4,000-5,000 a day), the future of the service was uncertain. It was sentimental, rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries, after much public protest to keep them. However, service frequency was reduced, with ferry fares being linked to bus and rail fares.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" /> During this period, maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably, with the ''Woodchurch'' being laid up as a salvage for parts for ''Mountwood'' and ''Overchurch''. At this time, the large brass [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]] from ''Overchurch'' was damaged and was replaced by that from ''Woodchurch''. After the damaged helm was repaired, it was placed on ''Woodchurch''. This has remained the case, even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt.\n\n1984 was a momentous year for the ferries and can be seen as the beginning of the ferries rise from the slumps of the 1970s. For the duration of the [[International Garden Festival]], a special ferry service was provided to [[Otterspool Promenade]]. This service was usually operated by the ''Overchurch''. The ferries also began to operate summer [[Manchester Ship Canal]] cruises, a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened, but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s. Sailing ships from the [[The Tall Ships' Races|Tall Ships' Race]] visited the river in August 1984, which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days, a level unseen for forty years.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" />\n\n===Bus deregulation and the 1990 changes===\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = Mersey Ferries\n| logo                = Mersey Ferries Logo.jpg\n| logo_size           = 300px\n| type                = [[Private limited company]]\n| foundation          = \n| location            = [[Liverpool]]\n| subsid              = \n| industry            = [[Public transport]]\n| revenue             = \n| operating_income    = \n| net_income          = \n| parent              = [[Merseytravel]]<br>[[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]]\n| homepage            = {{url|http://www.merseyferries.co.uk}}\n| footnotes           = \n| area_served         = [[River Mersey]]\n}}\nThe Mersey Ferries came under a new body called [[Merseytravel]] in 1986. On 26 October that year, as a result of the [[Transport Act 1985]], bus services were deregulated and restrictions which prevented regular bus services through the [[Mersey Tunnels]] were abolished. As a result, many buses which formerly stopped at the Birkenhead Woodside Bus/Ferry terminal were extended into Liverpool. This was another blow to  the Mersey Ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic, which had declined, to tourist needs.\n\nFrom 1990 a commuter shuttle has operated Monday-Friday peak period with an hourly River Explorer Cruise.  At weekends River Explorer cruises operate from 10:00 to 18:00. The morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a Liverpool-Birkehead-Seacombe-Liverpool circuit, but since then only runs every 20 minutes from Liverpool-Seacombe Ferry and back.\n\nThe evening peak service runs Liverpool-Seacombe every 20 minutes. The Explorer cruises follow a Liverpool-Seacombe-Birkenhead-Liverpool pattern and sail slightly further upstream with a commentary of what can be seen.\n\nThese operations run with a bias towards Seacombe Ferry as the vicinity of Seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of Birkenhead. In the summer there are also cruises up the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\n==Previous and present fleets==\n===The Royal family===\nThe \"Royal\" prefix was granted to the ferries [[HMS Iris II|''Iris'']] and [[SS Royal Daffodil|''Daffodil'']] for their service during the [[First World War]] where they were instrumental at the Mole in [[Zeebrugge]]. Both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting. Since the original duo's withdrawal, there have been other Royals. The ''Royal Daffodil II'' was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the Second World War, but later raised and returned to service, with little of her pre-war splendour. Perhaps the most famous Royal is the ''[[MV Royal Iris|Royal Iris]]'' of 1951. She was the best loved of all the Mersey ferries. She was the first diesel powered vessel of the Wallasey fleet. She had four diesel generators connected to two [[Metropolitan-Vickers|Metrovick]] marine propulsion units. She differed to all the other ferries as she had super smooth lines and a dummy funnel in place. She played host to hundreds of party cruises and bands such as [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[The Beatles]] and also [[Elvis Costello]]. She received a major refit in the 1970s and her popular fish and chip cafe - which earned her the name \"the fish and chip boat\" - was removed and replaced with a steak bar. The ''Royal Iris'' remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub. She is now berthed at [[Woolwich]], London. Attempts to bring her back to Merseyside have come to nothing due to the prohibitive cost of making her fit for a 1,000 mile journey coastwise.\n\n===Leasowe, Egremont and Royal Daffodil II===\n[[File:Egremont ferry.JPG|250px|thumb|''Egremont'' in [[Salcombe|Salcombe Harbour]]]]\nThe ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' were built by Philip and Co. in [[Dartmouth, Devon]] and entered service in late 1951 and early 1952 respectively. Named after suburbs of Wallasey, both vessels were commissioned by Wallasey Corporation.\n\nThey were of a traditional design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough, who are based in Liverpool, but boasted modern equipment including [[Crossley]] multi-speed engines for versatile control. They only had one single boarding gangway and their forward saloons extended to the whole width of the ship. This proved somewhat problematic especially at busy periods, so an additional gangway space was added on the promenade deck for use with the high level terminal gangways. The forward saloons also had facility for a bar area and dance floor, which meant the vessels could be used for cruising. The two vessels were primarily used on the Seacombe - Liverpool service, augmenting the New Brighton run during the summer seasons.\n\n''Egremont'' differed externally to ''Leasowe'' in that she had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' show them to have deckhead compasses above the wheelhouse and side boxes, which appear to have been removed in the late 1950s. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. [[Chadburn]] synchrostep [[telegraph]]s and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system and a ship to shore radio system. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the ''Edmund Gardner'' Pilot Boat at [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]]. The ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries.\n\nThe ''Royal Daffodil II'' was constructed by James Lamont and Co. at [[Greenock]] and entered service in 1957. She was larger than the Dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service. The gross tonnage of ''Royal Daffodil II'' was 609. A gross error was the size of her engines, developing 1,360&nbsp;bhp a piece she was underpowered and often struggled in strong tides. Aside from the engine order telegraphs, she also had helms in the side boxes meaning that the ship could be steered from them if required. The Roman II was added to her name because of a Thames estuary cruise ship also called Royal Daffodil which existed from 1939 until 1967 (see MV Royal Daffodil (1939)).\n\nWith the merger of the Wallasey and Birkenhead fleets in 1969, the ferries lost their Wallasey colours to be replaced with the primrose yellow and powder blue of the MPTE, and latterly emerald green and black. In the mid-1970s, ''Leasowe'' and ''Royal Daffodil II'' were sold to [[Greece|Greek]] owners and have been heavily modified since. The ''Leasowe'' is still cruising around the [[Greek Islands]]. The former ''Royal Daffodil II'' was converted to a container ship, but still retained its forward section largely in its original condition. The ferry reportedly sank in November 2007, 20 miles off the coast of [[Cape Andreas]], in heavy seas. The cause of the sinking was main engine and steering gear failure, and she claimed the lives of both her captain and mate.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=16258 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206185503/http://clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=16258 |url-status=usurped |archive-date=6 December 2010 |title=MV Royal Daffodil II|publisher=Shipping Times|accessdate=13 July 2008}}</ref> The ''Egremont'' was laid up in [[Morpeth Dock]] whilst on sale offer and in fact sprang a leak which flooded her engine room and ruined her engines rendering her inoperable. She was stripped of her machinery and towed to Salcombe, where she was used as a floating headquarters for the Island Cruising Club in [[Salcombe]], [[Devon]], not far from her original birthplace. As of April 2019, the vessel is no longer in use by the ICC and has been offered for sale.\n\n===''Mountwood'', ''Woodchurch'' and ''Overchurch''===\nThe current Mersey Ferries fleet comprises two vessels, based on a similar design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough of Liverpool. Until 2012 a third ferry, ''Royal Daffodil'', was also in service. Originally named ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Mountwood]]'', ''[[MV Snowdrop|Woodchurch]]'' and ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Overchurch]]'' after overspill post-war housing developments of Birkenhead. They were commissioned into service by Birkenhead Corporation.\n\n''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were built at Dartmouth by [[Philip and Son]]. The ''Mountwood'' was launched on the 31 July 1959 and the ''Woodchurch'' on the 28 October of the same year. They were loosely based on designs of the ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' of the Wallasey fleet, although they both weighed considerably more at 464 tonnes, compared with 311 tonnes for the earlier vessels. They are also larger than the older Wallasey pair, being approximately 19 feet longer, 6 feet broader and over a foot taller. Both vessels were externally identical in almost every way up until 1991 when the shroud protecting the aft funnel vent on the ''Mountwood'' was changed from square to rounded.\n\nCompared to the earlier Wallasey twins, the ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were highly advanced. They benefited from an injection of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by Chadburns were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs were part of a brand known as \"Synchrostep\" and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. ''Overchurch'' had the same telegraph 'heads' however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were a hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the rubbing strake. In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes.\n\nOn the bridge was also a brass talk tube that linked down to the engine room. A prank amongst bridge crews was to call an engineer on the talk tube then pour water down it, thus soaking the engineer at the other end.\n\nThe ''Mountwood'' was used in the film \"''[[Ferry Cross the Mersey (film)|Ferry Cross The Mersey]]\"'', a musical and subsequent [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] song, crossing to Liverpool from Birkenhead. Her near sister ''Overchurch'' also appeared in the background of several shots. In her early years ''Mountwood'' was an unreliable ship. She had broken down whilst crossing the river and had to anchor. Her passengers were rescued by ''Woodchurch''. She also collided with ''Bidston'' whilst berthing, due to an error in engine movements.\n\nIn 1962, ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were joined by a new ferry, the ''Overchurch''. Built at the Birkenhead shipyard of [[Cammell Laird]] and Co., ''Overchurch'' was of all welded construction and also had a bridge that was completely enclosed rather than a wheelhouse and navigation boxes like ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. The addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it, whereas on the two sisters there were three, one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes. The ''Overchurch'' also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units, meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge, rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. ''Overchurch'' had a high funnel immediately behind the bridge and also a small bridge deck, giving the appearance of a somewhat forward top-heavy look, as a result. The ''Overchurch'' was fitted with the same navigation equipment as her near sisters. She differed slightly by being a few tonnes heavier and a few inches longer. The ''Overchurch'' also had only one access stairway to the promenade deck unlike the Dartmouth twins which had two.\n\nIn 1962, the ''Overchurch'' conveyed [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] to open the new Cammell Laird dry dock.<ref name=\"The Mersey At Work: Ferries\">{{citation|title=The Mersey At Work: Ferries|first=JC|last=Emmerson|publisher=Countryvise Ltd|year=1982|isbn=0-907768-35-0}}</ref>\n\nThe trio of ferries all remained in near constant operation up until 1981, when cost-cutting measures saw ''Woodchurch'' withdrawn for almost three years.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" /> It was rumoured that she was cannibalised to help keep her sisters running. Whilst in lay up at [[Clarence Dock (Liverpool)|Clarence dry docks]], she was offered for sale, with one prospective buyer hoping to use her to operate cruises around the [[Isle of Man]]. She was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint ''Woodchurch'' returned to service in 1983, freeing up ''Overchurch'' to become the primary ferry to be used on a new Otterspool service, set up for the 1984 International Garden Festival. The ferries all operated on a normal 20 minute route throughout this.\n\nWhen the ferries were taken over by the PTE, they lost their original liveries and these were swiftly replaced with sky blue and primrose yellow. This was in turn replaced with black and green, and then colours of the Union Jack for the Garden Festival. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw very limited budgets for maintenance and the ferries are noted to look in poor condition during this period.\n\nIn 1989, ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were withdrawn and extensively refurbished internally which resulted in complete rewiring and main engine repairs. They were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge, although none of the original equipment was removed from the new bridge. They entered service by July 1990 in time for the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''QE2's'']] first visit to the Mersey and also operated the new \"heritage cruises\". They also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the Garden Festival season of 1984. The ''Overchurch'' also underwent some refurbishments at [[Bootle]]. She was then moved to the ferries' regular berth on the [[Great Float|East Float]], where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season. In 1996 the ''Overchurch'' was given a small refit which involved the enclosing of the promenade deck shelter.\n\n===Liveries===\n[[File:MV Snowdrop, River Mersey (geograph 4493019).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' in her \"Razzle Dazzle\" livery in 2015]]\nThe ferries companies were identifiable by their different colour liveries displayed on each vessel's funnel. Wallasey ferries carried a black and white colour scheme. Early Birkenhead steamers carried red and black, however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s and this remained up until the merger of the two fleets under the MPTE in 1969.\n\nFrom January 2015, MV ''Snowdrop'' had a special livery applied, based on the [[World War I]] [[dazzle camouflage]] and designed by [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/02/mersey-ferry-peter-blake-dazzle-treatment-first-world-war|title=Mersey ferry gets the dazzle treatment from Sir Peter Blake|work=Guardian|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Refits and renamings===\n[[File:Mersey Ferries, East Float, Wallasey - geograph.org.uk - 1405261.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' & ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' berthed at East Float, Wallasey]]\nThe ''Overchurch'' was given her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in [[Manchester]], which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Royal Daffodil]]'' and returned to service in 1999. ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were also refitted and renamed ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' and ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'', respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]]s and binnacles with compasses were placed back on the refurbished bridges. The current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of ''Royal Iris of the Mersey'' and the ''Snowdrop''. This remarkable service life is testament to the dedication and care taken by the ferries' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis.\n\nThe new [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] engines fitted on the ferries are much more economical than the previous engines by Crossley Bros of Manchester. They are also much 'greener' and produce much less emissions than the original propulsion units.\n\nThe ferries' masts now carry several other navigation lights on their main masts at various points. Prior to refit, they had only a forward-facing white light. This is due to the classification of the ferries.\n\nThe ''Snowdrop'' and ''Royal Iris'' each carry two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/165 type fog horns. ''Royal Daffodil'' carries two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/195 horns. These are the original horns fitted when the ferries were first built. Both ''Royal Iris of the Mersey'' and ''Snowdrop'' have an [[E\u266d (musical note)|E-flat]] tone, and ''Royal Daffodil's'' is in F Sharp.\n\nWhen berthing the vessel, the captain uses a combination of rudder positions and engine movements. The ferries all have twin rudders and propellers, making them very maneuverable.\n\nThe Mersey Ferries used to operate in fog, however currently the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor.\n\n==Liverpool 08==\nThe ferries played a big part in Liverpool's [[European Capital of Culture]] 2008 celebrations. The ferries carried record numbers of passengers,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx|title=101 Interesting Facts|accessdate=16 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904150644/http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx|archivedate=4 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and on the 18\u201321 July, the Tall Ships returned to the Mersey. A combination of the Tall Ships and the Golf Open at nearby [[Royal Birkdale Golf Club|Royal Birkdale]] ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend, with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries. Sunday 20 July saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night, with the ''Snowdrop'' being berthed at Woodside and the ''Royal Iris'' and ''Royal Daffodil'' at Seacombe. All three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend, with the ''Royal Daffodil'' operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on Monday 21 July.\n\n==Future==\nIn August 2012, it was announced that Merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on Mersey Ferries operations after the service is running at a \u00a31 million annual loss.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19402586|title=Mersey Ferries to be reviewed over \u00a31m yearly losses|publisher=BBC|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref> As a result of this review, the ferry ''Royal Daffodil'' was withdrawn from service in January 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19839352|title=Mersey Ferries to remove one of three services|publisher=BBC|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref> Another threat to the ferries' future is the cost of replacing the current ferries, the oldest ever to ply the river, when required.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn December 2015 Merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two Wirral landing stages (possibly Woodside), a later start to commuter services  which only operate from Seacombe to Liverpool, and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events, a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 ''Royal Iris''.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-35112783  \"Mersey ferry terminal could close, 20-year plan reveals\", BBC News, 16 December 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Mersey Ferries Long Term Strategy, whilst currently subject to approval, anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020\u201321.

The song was written by [[Gerry Marsden]], recorded by [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] and was a hit in both the UK and US. In 1989, a charity version of the song was recorded by Liverpool artists [[The Christians (band)|The Christians]], [[Holly Johnson]], [[Paul McCartney]], Gerry Marsden, and [[Stock Aitken Waterman]], and was released in aid of those affected by the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. It was number one in the UK chart for three weeks.\n\nThe ferries also featured in the opening credit sequences of the popular [[BBC TV]] [[comedy]] series, ''[[The Liver Birds]]'', written by [[Carla Lane]], which ran from 1969 to 1979. The ferry depicted was the ''Royal Daffodil II''.\n\nThe ferries were referred to repeatedly in [[Helen Forrester]]'s 1974 book ''Twopence to Cross the Mersey'', because the [[fare]] for a journey to the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] ([[two pence (British pre-decimal coin)|two pence]]) was too expensive for a destitute [[Liverpool]] family to afford during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|first=T.

Ferries have been used on this route since at least the 12th century, and continue to be popular for both local people and visitors.\n\nThe current fleet consists of two vessels. A third ferry, ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Royal Daffodil]]'' was in service until 2012. The current ferries originally came into service in the 1960s and were named ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. Both ferries have been extensively refurbished and renamed ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' and ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]''.  The ferries share the workload of cross-river ferrying, charter cruises and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] cruise. The service is operated by [[Merseytravel]], under the \u201c'''Mersey Ferries'''\u201d brand.\n\n==History==\n===Medieval ferries===\nIn about 1150, the [[Birkenhead Priory|Benedictine Priory]] at [[Birkenhead]] was established.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1019159|desc=Birkenhead Priory|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river. At this time, the Mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to [[Ainsdale]] beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near Otterspool. The only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the Pool, near the site of the present Merseyside Police headquarters. Weather often stopped crossings and passengers were delayed for days, taking shelter at the priory.\n\nIn 1317, a royal licence was issued, granting permission to the Priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]]. [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] visited Liverpool in 1323, and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to [[Ince, Cheshire|Ince]]. In 1330, his son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: ''\"the right of ferry there\u2026 for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls\"''. At the time, there was only a small hamlet at Birkenhead, and a slightly larger village at Liverpool.<ref name=bri2e>{{citation|url=http://www.bri2e.co.uk/places/woodside/intro.htm|title=Woodside Ferry, Birkenhead|first=Brian|last=Tuohey|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Chester Indictments record criminal activities on the Mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In 1355, Richard, son of Simon de Becheton, was murdered on the ferry; the murderers escaped and took refuge at [[Shotwick]]. In 1365, it was recorded that there were four ferryboats operating without a licence, from [[Bromborough]] and Eastham. In 1414, William de Stanley, the servant of John Talbot, later [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], was on the ferry between Birkenhead and Liverpool when about 200 men assaulted him, and stole his bay horse valued at \u00a35 (current value - over \u00a32,800), a bow and 14 arrows valued at 3s 4d (current value - over \u00a395) and a barge valued at \u00a310 (current value - over \u00a35,700). The thieves were fined.<ref name=Hardman>{{citation|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.31&chapterId=152|title=Ferries across the Mersey: Early history of Mersey ferries|publisher=E.

The licence then passed to the [[Abbey of St Werburgh]], in [[Chester]], and became known as Job's Ferry. Early ferries also existed across the Mersey further upstream, at Ince and at [[Runcorn]].\n[[File:Liverpool-1911.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Map from 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, showing ferry routes]]\n\n===From the 16th to the 18th century===\nThe monks of Birkenhead Priory operated a ferry service until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the priory's destruction by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] troops in 1536. Ownership reverted to the Crown, and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the Priory properties were bought by Ralph Worsley of Lancashire for \u00a3586. 11s. 6d (current value - almost \u00a3205,000).  The rights later passed to the [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] family. By 1541 William Bromley had the licence for ferries at Seacombe, and in 1586, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] granted John Poole of [[Great Sutton|Sutton]] the rights at [[Tranmere, Merseyside|Tranmere]].<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships. The use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed, but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather. The Mersey is famed for its thick fogs, and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate. The frequency depended on demand and the weather.\n\nBy the 18th century, the commercial expansion of Liverpool and the increase in [[stage coach]] traffic from [[Chester]] spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river.<ref name=\"Hardman Woodside and the Mersey ferries\">{{citation|url=http://www.mersey-gateway.org/server.php?show=ConNarrative.31&chapterId=154|title=Ferries across the Mersey: Woodside and the Mersey ferries|publisher=E.

By 1753 the Cheshire side of the Mersey had at least five ferry houses at Ince, Eastham, the Rock, Woodside and Seacombe. The service from [[New Ferry]] to Liverpool was first mentioned in 1774.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\n===Steam ferries===\nThe first [[steam ships|steamship]] to operate on the Mersey was the ''Elizabeth'', a wooden paddle steamer, which was introduced in 1815 to operate between Liverpool and Runcorn.<ref name=museums>{{citation|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/displayGuide.aspx?sid=33&serStr=&sorStr=s_no%20ASC%200&pgeInt=0&catStr= |title=Liverpool Maritime Archives & Library Information Sheet|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>  There was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel. For the steam ferry ''Etna'', which entered service at Tranmere on 17 April 1817, the idea of extension stages was mooted. These were long piers that were mounted on wheels and, by using a steam engine, could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide.\n\nAt Woodside, a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth, and in 1822 the paddle steamer ''Royal Mail'' began commercial operation between Liverpool and Woodside.<ref name=\"museums\"/> The town of Birkenhead was just starting to develop at this point. In 1820, the Birkenhead Ferry began operating from a new site just to the south; this closed in 1870. The Woodside, North Birkenhead and Liverpool Steam Ferry Company was formed in 1835, and the slipway at Woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier. In 1838, the Monks Ferry Company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of Woodside, but this service closed in 1878.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nFrom about 1830, steam ferries also operated from the new [[seaside resort|resort]] developed by James Atherton at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], and from nearby [[Egremont, Merseyside|Egremont]]. Steam ferries also began operating from Eastham.\n\nBy the 1840s, Birkenhead was developing into a busy new town. The [[Chester and Birkenhead Railway|railway to Chester]] had opened, the town was growing quickly, and the docks were under construction. There were also competing ferry services and disputes over the rights granted to the monks, and there was a need to improve the facilities at Woodside. In the early 1840s, the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end. However, this soon became inadequate.<ref name=\"bri2e\"/>\n\nIn 1847, the first floating landing stage, which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time, was opened at Liverpool. The first portion, known as the Georges' landing stage, was designed by [[William Cubitt]] and was 500 feet long. It was rebuilt and extended in 1874.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Liverpool|volume=16|page=808|first=William Fergusson |last=Irvine}}</ref>\n\n===The Corporation Years===\nUntil the establishment of the [[Mersey Railway]] in 1886, the ferries were the only means of crossing the river, and so all of the routes were heavily used. All of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under [[municipal]] ownership in the mid 19th century. The Woodside ferry was taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners in 1858 and, in 1861, the Wallasey Local Board took over the ferry services at Seacombe, Egremont and New Brighton. At Woodside, land between the Woodside Hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed, and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened. The pontoons were towed into position, moored by chains originally made for the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], and linked to the mainland by two double bridges.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nThe ''Cheshire'', the first passenger ferry steamer to have a saloon, operated from Woodside in 1864. The iron pier at Eastham was built in 1874. On 26 November 1878, the ferry ''Gem'', a paddle steamer operated from Seacombe by the Wallasey Local Board, collided with the ''Bowfell'', a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the River Mersey; five people died as a result.\n\nIn 1886 the [[Mersey Railway Tunnel]] was opened, providing competition for the ferry services. The Woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890, which replaced [[paddle steamers]]. In 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day.<ref name=\"museums\"/> The ferry service at Tranmere, which had operated since mediaeval times, closed in 1897. The pier and landing stage at Rock Ferry was built in 1899, and Birkenhead Corporation also operated the ferry service at New Ferry.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nIn 1914 [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] travelled on the ferry ''S.S. Daffodil'' from Wallasey to Liverpool. During the [[First World War]] the steamers ''Iris'' and ''Daffodil'' were taken out of service from Wallasey to be used as troop ships in the [[Zeebrugge Raid|naval raid on Zeebrugge]] in Belgium. The ferries had a shallow draft, allowing them to skim over the [[Naval mine|mines]] floating beneath the surface, and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] curling into the [[North Sea]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-special-features/2008/03/15/how-the-mersey-ferries-helped-win-the-first-world-war-64375-20627075/ |title=How the Mersey Ferries helped win the First World War|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|date=15 March 2008|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref> They both saw action, which was described on 24 April 1918 by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Vice\u2013Admiral Sir Roger Keyes]] of the [[Royal Navy]] in a message to the ferries' manager:\n<blockquote>\n''\"I am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried Bluejackets and Marines to Zeebrugge, and remained alongside the Mole for an hour, greatly contributing to the success of the operation... The damage caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired\"''.\n</blockquote>\nBecause of their work King George V allowed the vessels to use the word ''\"Royal\"'' in their name. They needed extensive refitting before they could resume peacetime activities.<ref name=\"Hardman\"/>\n\nIn the boats themselves, there was quick development. The early incarnations of today's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships, mainly the 1906 pair, ''Royal Iris'' and ''Royal Daffodil''. The Wallasey [[twin screw steamer|twin screw]] vessels all had [[flying bridge]]s with port and starboard docking cabs. As built, the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level, however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level. They were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], which is about the same as today's trio of ferries. On early paddlers, the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam, and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different. Birkenhead did not use flying bridges, instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level. Wallasey ferries employed a funnel [[livery]] of white and black and Birkenhead red and black. Birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war.\n\nWhen the railway tunnels were constructed and opened, the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular. It was really the advent of the road tunnels that caused trouble. When the [[Queensway road tunnel]] opened in 1934, the ferry service from Seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry. The opening of the road tunnel also had an effect on the luggage boats which were introduced in 1879. Both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats, which carried vehicles and goods across the river. When the road tunnel opened, traffic dropped by 80%. By the 1940s, luggage boat services from both Woodside and Seacombe to Liverpool had ceased.\n\nDue to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage, Birkenhead Corporation gradually closed its southern terminals; New Ferry (officially) on 22 September 1927, Eastham in 1929 and Rock Ferry on 30 June 1939. The closure of Eastham marked the last use of ferry [[paddle steamers]] on the river.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\">{{citation|title=Mersey Ferries - Volume 1|first=TB|last=Maund|publisher=Transport Publishing Co. Ltd|year=1991|isbn=0-86317-166-4}}</ref> Wallasey were always trying to close Egremont, but faced stiff opposition from locals who got petitions to keep the ferry open. The chance came to close Egremont during the [[Second World War]] for economical reasons, after the pier was damaged in a collision. This was in similar circumstances to the demise of New Ferry twenty years earlier. As a result, the Egremont service never reopened.\n\nIn 1941, mines which had drifted into the River Mersey stopped ferry crossings. The ''Oxton'' and ''Bebington'' vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload United States aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the Liverpool landing stage. The ''Upton'' vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in Liverpool Bay.\n\nIn 1950, the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year, including 11 million on the Woodside ferries and 15 million on Seacombe ferries, but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million. Night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956.\n\n===The MPTE takes over===\n[[File:Snowdrop at irlam locks on manchester ship canal.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' at Irlam Locks on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]]]\nAs a result of the [[Transport Act 1968]], both Wallasey and Birkenhead Corporations merged under the single control of the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (MPTE) on 1 December 1969.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" />  By this time, New Brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage, the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971, with the stage and pier subsequently demolished.\n\nIn spite of the close proximity of Wallasey and Birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages, both Corporations had used different gangway spacing on their vessels. This meant that a Wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at Birkenhead's terminal at Woodside, and that a Birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at Seacombe and New Brighton. The Pier Head at Liverpool was obliged to have gangways to suit both sets of ships. When the combined ferry fleet was rationalised, Seacombe Ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the Birkenhead vessels.\n\nThe 1970s economic situation in Britain saw costs escalating, with funding limited by the MPTE, which was embarking on an expensive operation to construct the [[Merseyrail]] \"Liverpool Loop\" extension. Compounded with the opening of the [[Kingsway Tunnel|Kingsway road tunnel]] on 28 June 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers (only 4,000-5,000 a day), the future of the service was uncertain. It was sentimental, rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries, after much public protest to keep them. However, service frequency was reduced, with ferry fares being linked to bus and rail fares.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" /> During this period, maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably, with the ''Woodchurch'' being laid up as a salvage for parts for ''Mountwood'' and ''Overchurch''. At this time, the large brass [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]] from ''Overchurch'' was damaged and was replaced by that from ''Woodchurch''. After the damaged helm was repaired, it was placed on ''Woodchurch''. This has remained the case, even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt.\n\n1984 was a momentous year for the ferries and can be seen as the beginning of the ferries rise from the slumps of the 1970s. For the duration of the [[International Garden Festival]], a special ferry service was provided to [[Otterspool Promenade]]. This service was usually operated by the ''Overchurch''. The ferries also began to operate summer [[Manchester Ship Canal]] cruises, a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened, but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s. Sailing ships from the [[The Tall Ships' Races|Tall Ships' Race]] visited the river in August 1984, which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days, a level unseen for forty years.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" />\n\n===Bus deregulation and the 1990 changes===\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = Mersey Ferries\n| logo                = Mersey Ferries Logo.jpg\n| logo_size           = 300px\n| type                = [[Private limited company]]\n| foundation          = \n| location            = [[Liverpool]]\n| subsid              = \n| industry            = [[Public transport]]\n| revenue             = \n| operating_income    = \n| net_income          = \n| parent              = [[Merseytravel]]<br>[[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]]\n| homepage            = {{url|http://www.merseyferries.co.uk}}\n| footnotes           = \n| area_served         = [[River Mersey]]\n}}\nThe Mersey Ferries came under a new body called [[Merseytravel]] in 1986. On 26 October that year, as a result of the [[Transport Act 1985]], bus services were deregulated and restrictions which prevented regular bus services through the [[Mersey Tunnels]] were abolished. As a result, many buses which formerly stopped at the Birkenhead Woodside Bus/Ferry terminal were extended into Liverpool. This was another blow to  the Mersey Ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic, which had declined, to tourist needs.\n\nFrom 1990 a commuter shuttle has operated Monday-Friday peak period with an hourly River Explorer Cruise.  At weekends River Explorer cruises operate from 10:00 to 18:00. The morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a Liverpool-Birkehead-Seacombe-Liverpool circuit, but since then only runs every 20 minutes from Liverpool-Seacombe Ferry and back.\n\nThe evening peak service runs Liverpool-Seacombe every 20 minutes. The Explorer cruises follow a Liverpool-Seacombe-Birkenhead-Liverpool pattern and sail slightly further upstream with a commentary of what can be seen.\n\nThese operations run with a bias towards Seacombe Ferry as the vicinity of Seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of Birkenhead. In the summer there are also cruises up the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\n==Previous & present fleets==\n===The Royal family===\nThe \"Royal\" prefix was granted to the ferries [[HMS Iris II|''Iris'']] and [[SS Royal Daffodil|''Daffodil'']] for their service during the [[First World War]] where they were instrumental at the Mole in [[Zeebrugge]]. Both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting. Since the original duo's withdrawal, there have been other Royals. The ''Royal Daffodil II'' was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the Second World War, but later raised and returned to service, with little of her pre-war splendour. Perhaps the most famous Royal is the ''[[MV Royal Iris|Royal Iris]]'' of 1951. She was the best loved of all the Mersey ferries. She was the first diesel powered vessel of the Wallasey fleet. She had four diesel generators connected to two [[Metropolitan-Vickers|Metrovick]] marine propulsion units. She differed to all the other ferries as she had super smooth lines and a dummy funnel in place. She played host to hundreds of party cruises and bands such as [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[The Beatles]] and also [[Elvis Costello]]. She received a major refit in the 1970s and her popular fish and chip cafe - which earned her the name \"the fish and chip boat\" - was removed and replaced with a steak bar. The ''Royal Iris'' remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub. She is now berthed at [[Woolwich]], London. Attempts to bring her back to Merseyside have come to nothing due to the prohibitive cost of making her fit for a 1,000 mile journey coastwise.\n\n===Leasowe, Egremont and Royal Daffodil II===\n[[File:Egremont ferry.JPG|250px|thumb|''Egremont'' in [[Salcombe|Salcombe Harbour]]]]\nThe ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' were built by Philip and Co. in [[Dartmouth, Devon]] and entered service in late 1951 and early 1952 respectively. Named after suburbs of Wallasey, both vessels were commissioned by Wallasey Corporation.\n\nThey were of a traditional design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough, who are based in Liverpool, but boasted modern equipment including [[Crossley]] multi-speed engines for versatile control. They only had one single boarding gangway and their forward saloons extended to the whole width of the ship. This proved somewhat problematic especially at busy periods, so an additional gangway space was added on the promenade deck for use with the high level terminal gangways. The forward saloons also had facility for a bar area and dance floor, which meant the vessels could be used for cruising. The two vessels were primarily used on the Seacombe - Liverpool service, augmenting the New Brighton run during the summer seasons.\n\n''Egremont'' differed externally to ''Leasowe'' in that she had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' show them to have deckhead compasses above the wheelhouse and side boxes, which appear to have been removed in the late 1950s. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. [[Chadburn]] synchrostep [[telegraph]]s and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system and a ship to shore radio system. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the ''Edmund Gardner'' Pilot Boat at [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]]. The ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries.\n\nThe ''Royal Daffodil II'' was constructed by James Lamont and Co. at [[Greenock]] and entered service in 1957. She was larger than the Dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service. The gross tonnage of ''Royal Daffodil II'' was 609. A gross error was the size of her engines, developing 1,360&nbsp;bhp a piece she was underpowered and often struggled in strong tides. Aside from the engine order telegraphs, she also had helms in the side boxes meaning that the ship could be steered from them if required. The Roman II was added to her name because of a Thames estuary cruise ship also called Royal Daffodil which existed from 1939 until 1967 (see MV Royal Daffodil (1939)).\n\nWith the merger of the Wallasey and Birkenhead fleets in 1969, the ferries lost their Wallasey colours to be replaced with the primrose yellow and powder blue of the MPTE, and latterly emerald green and black. In the mid-1970s, ''Leasowe'' and ''Royal Daffodil II'' were sold to [[Greece|Greek]] owners and have been heavily modified since. The ''Leasowe'' is still cruising around the [[Greek Islands]]. The former ''Royal Daffodil II'' was converted to a container ship, but still retained its forward section largely in its original condition. The ferry reportedly sank in November 2007, 20 miles off the coast of [[Cape Andreas]], in heavy seas. The cause of the sinking was main engine and steering gear failure, and she claimed the lives of both her captain and mate.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=16258 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206185503/http://clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=16258 |url-status=usurped |archive-date=6 December 2010 |title=MV Royal Daffodil II|publisher=Shipping Times|accessdate=13 July 2008}}</ref> The ''Egremont'' was laid up in [[Morpeth Dock]] whilst on sale offer and in fact sprang a leak which flooded her engine room and ruined her engines rendering her inoperable. She was stripped of her machinery and towed to Salcombe, where she was used as a floating headquarters for the Island Cruising Club in [[Salcombe]], [[Devon]], not far from her original birthplace. As of April 2019, the vessel is no longer in use by the ICC and has been offered for sale.\n\n===''Mountwood'', ''Woodchurch'' and ''Overchurch''===\nThe current Mersey Ferries fleet comprises two vessels, based on a similar design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough of Liverpool. Until 2012 a third ferry, ''Royal Daffodil'', was also in service. Originally named ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Mountwood]]'', ''[[MV Snowdrop|Woodchurch]]'' and ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Overchurch]]'' after overspill post-war housing developments of Birkenhead. They were commissioned into service by Birkenhead Corporation.\n\n''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were built at Dartmouth by [[Philip and Son]]. The ''Mountwood'' was launched on the 31 July 1959 and the ''Woodchurch'' on the 28 October of the same year. They were loosely based on designs of the ''Leasowe'' and ''Egremont'' of the Wallasey fleet, although they both weighed considerably more at 464 tonnes, compared with 311 tonnes for the earlier vessels. They are also larger than the older Wallasey pair, being approximately 19 feet longer, 6 feet broader and over a foot taller. Both vessels were externally identical in almost every way up until 1991 when the shroud protecting the aft funnel vent on the ''Mountwood'' was changed from square to rounded.\n\nCompared to the earlier Wallasey twins, the ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were highly advanced. They benefited from an injection of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by Chadburns were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs were part of a brand known as \"Synchrostep\" and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. ''Overchurch'' had the same telegraph 'heads' however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were a hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the rubbing strake. In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes.\n\nOn the bridge was also a brass talk tube that linked down to the engine room. A prank amongst bridge crews was to call an engineer on the talk tube then pour water down it, thus soaking the engineer at the other end.\n\nThe ''Mountwood'' was used in the film \"''[[Ferry Cross the Mersey (film)|Ferry Cross The Mersey]]\"'', a musical and subsequent [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] song, crossing to Liverpool from Birkenhead. Her near sister ''Overchurch'' also appeared in the background of several shots. In her early years ''Mountwood'' was an unreliable ship. She had broken down whilst crossing the river and had to anchor. Her passengers were rescued by ''Woodchurch''. She also collided with ''Bidston'' whilst berthing, due to an error in engine movements.\n\nIn 1962, ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were joined by a new ferry, the ''Overchurch''. Built at the Birkenhead shipyard of [[Cammell Laird]] and Co., ''Overchurch'' was of all welded construction and also had a bridge that was completely enclosed rather than a wheelhouse and navigation boxes like ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. The addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it, whereas on the two sisters there were three, one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes. The ''Overchurch'' also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units, meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge, rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch''. ''Overchurch'' had a high funnel immediately behind the bridge and also a small bridge deck, giving the appearance of a somewhat forward top-heavy look, as a result. The ''Overchurch'' was fitted with the same navigation equipment as her near sisters. She differed slightly by being a few tonnes heavier and a few inches longer. The ''Overchurch'' also had only one access stairway to the promenade deck unlike the Dartmouth twins which had two.\n\nIn 1962, the ''Overchurch'' conveyed [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] to open the new Cammell Laird dry dock.<ref name=\"The Mersey At Work: Ferries\">{{citation|title=The Mersey At Work: Ferries|first=JC|last=Emmerson|publisher=Countryvise Ltd|year=1982|isbn=0-907768-35-0}}</ref>\n\nThe trio of ferries all remained in near constant operation up until 1981, when cost-cutting measures saw ''Woodchurch'' withdrawn for almost three years.<ref name=\"Mersey Ferries - Volume 1\" /> It was rumoured that she was cannibalised to help keep her sisters running. Whilst in lay up at [[Clarence Dock (Liverpool)|Clarence dry docks]], she was offered for sale, with one prospective buyer hoping to use her to operate cruises around the [[Isle of Man]]. She was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint ''Woodchurch'' returned to service in 1983, freeing up ''Overchurch'' to become the primary ferry to be used on a new Otterspool service, set up for the 1984 International Garden Festival. The ferries all operated on a normal 20 minute route throughout this.\n\nWhen the ferries were taken over by the PTE, they lost their original liveries and these were swiftly replaced with sky blue and primrose yellow. This was in turn replaced with black and green, and then colours of the Union Jack for the Garden Festival. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw very limited budgets for maintenance and the ferries are noted to look in poor condition during this period.\n\nIn 1989, ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were withdrawn and extensively refurbished internally which resulted in complete rewiring and main engine repairs. They were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge, although none of the original equipment was removed from the new bridge. They entered service by July 1990 in time for the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''QE2's'']] first visit to the Mersey and also operated the new \"heritage cruises\". They also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the Garden Festival season of 1984. The ''Overchurch'' also underwent some refurbishments at [[Bootle]]. She was then moved to the ferries' regular berth on the [[Great Float|East Float]], where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season. In 1996 the ''Overchurch'' was given a small refit which involved the enclosing of the promenade deck shelter.\n\n===Liveries===\n[[File:MV Snowdrop, River Mersey (geograph 4493019).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' in her \"Razzle Dazzle\" livery in 2015]]\nThe ferries companies were identifiable by their different colour liveries displayed on each vessel's funnel. Wallasey ferries carried a black and white colour scheme. Early Birkenhead steamers carried red and black, however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s and this remained up until the merger of the two fleets under the MPTE in 1969.\n\nFrom January 2015, MV ''Snowdrop'' had a special livery applied, based on the [[World War I]] [[dazzle camouflage]] and designed by [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/02/mersey-ferry-peter-blake-dazzle-treatment-first-world-war|title=Mersey ferry gets the dazzle treatment from Sir Peter Blake|work=Guardian|accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Refits and renamings===\n[[File:Mersey Ferries, East Float, Wallasey - geograph.org.uk - 1405261.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' & ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'' berthed at East Float, Wallasey]]\nThe ''Overchurch'' was given her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in [[Manchester]], which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed ''[[MV Royal Daffodil|Royal Daffodil]]'' and returned to service in 1999. ''Mountwood'' and ''Woodchurch'' were also refitted and renamed ''[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey|Royal Iris of the Mersey]]'' and ''[[MV Snowdrop|Snowdrop]]'', respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]]s and binnacles with compasses were placed back on the refurbished bridges. The current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of ''Royal Iris of the Mersey'' and the ''Snowdrop''. This remarkable service life is testament to the dedication and care taken by the ferries' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis.\n\nThe new [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] engines fitted on the ferries are much more economical than the previous engines by Crossley Bros of Manchester. They are also much 'greener' and produce much less emissions than the original propulsion units.\n\nThe ferries' masts now carry several other navigation lights on their main masts at various points. Prior to refit, they had only a forward-facing white light. This is due to the classification of the ferries.\n\nThe ''Snowdrop'' and ''Royal Iris'' each carry two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/165 type fog horns. ''Royal Daffodil'' carries two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/195 horns. These are the original horns fitted when the ferries were first built. Both ''Royal Iris of the Mersey'' and ''Snowdrop'' have an [[E\u266d (musical note)|E-flat]] tone, and ''Royal Daffodil's'' is in F Sharp.\n\nWhen berthing the vessel, the captain uses a combination of rudder positions and engine movements. The ferries all have twin rudders and propellers, making them very maneuverable.\n\nThe Mersey Ferries used to operate in fog, however currently the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor.\n\n==Liverpool 08==\nThe ferries played a big part in Liverpool's [[European Capital of Culture]] 2008 celebrations. The ferries carried record numbers of passengers,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx|title=101 Interesting Facts|accessdate=16 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904150644/http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/Content/AboutUs/2ndLevelNavigation.aspx|archivedate=4 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and on the 18\u201321 July, the Tall Ships returned to the Mersey. A combination of the Tall Ships and the Golf Open at nearby [[Royal Birkdale Golf Club|Royal Birkdale]] ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend, with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries. Sunday 20 July saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night, with the ''Snowdrop'' being berthed at Woodside and the ''Royal Iris'' and ''Royal Daffodil'' at Seacombe. All three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend, with the ''Royal Daffodil'' operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on Monday 21 July.\n\n==Future==\nIn August 2012, it was announced that Merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on Mersey Ferries operations after the service is running at a \u00a31 million annual loss.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19402586|title=Mersey Ferries to be reviewed over \u00a31m yearly losses|publisher=BBC|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref> As a result of this review, the ferry ''Royal Daffodil'' was withdrawn from service in January 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-19839352|title=Mersey Ferries to remove one of three services|publisher=BBC|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref> Another threat to the ferries' future is the cost of replacing the current ferries, the oldest ever to ply the river, when required.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn December 2015 Merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two Wirral landing stages (possibly Woodside), a later start to commuter services  which only operate from Seacombe to Liverpool, and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events, a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 ''Royal Iris''.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-35112783  \"Mersey ferry terminal could close, 20-year plan reveals\", BBC News, 16 December 2015]</ref>\n\nThe Mersey Ferries Long Term Strategy, whilst currently subject to approval, anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020\u201321.

The song was written by [[Gerry Marsden]], recorded by [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]] and was a hit in both the UK and US. In 1989, a charity version of the song was recorded by Liverpool artists [[The Christians (band)|The Christians]], [[Holly Johnson]], [[Paul McCartney]], Gerry Marsden, and [[Stock Aitken Waterman]], and was released in aid of those affected by the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. It was number one in the UK chart for three weeks.\n\nThe ferries also featured in the opening credit sequences of the popular [[BBC TV]] [[comedy]] series, ''[[The Liver Birds]]'', written by [[Carla Lane]], which ran from 1969 to 1979. The ferry depicted was the ''Royal Daffodil II''.\n\nThe ferries were referred to repeatedly in [[Helen Forrester]]'s 1974 book ''Twopence to Cross the Mersey'', because the [[fare]] for a journey to the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] ([[two pence (British pre-decimal coin)|two pence]]) was too expensive for a destitute [[Liverpool]] family to afford during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|first=T.

The society is continually involved in matters which concern operations researchers, such as organising conferences at which papers on OR-related topics are delivered, drawing up guidelines for OR education, presenting short courses on specialist topics in OR, marketing OR at secondary school level, providing information to the public on the nature of OR, and providing information to students at tertiary level on career opportunities in OR.\n\n== History ==\nOn 18 April 1968 a meeting of individuals interested in OR was held at the Gatehouse at the Sunnyside Hotel in Johannesburg, as a result of initiatives taken by Dave Masterson, Jonathan Miller, Alan H. Munro and John C. Joslin with the support of Dr. H.S. Sichel. The attendance at this multi-disciplinary meeting was in excess of 180. The guest speaker was Prof. B.H. Patrick Rivett of England, an excellent speaker and at that time one of the best known operations researchers in the world. Out of this meeting a National Steering Committee was formed which would be responsible for the organisation of the possible establishment of an Operations Research Society in South Africa.<ref>Masterson, Dave. 1990. \"Some recollections of the early days.\" Newsletter of ORSSA/Nuusbrief van ONSA, May/Mei, 17-18.</ref> The committee consisted of Dr. H.S. Sichel (Chairman), Profs. G.J. Rudolph of Rhodes University, H.J. Venter of the University of Potchefstroom and C. Jacobs of the CSIR, and Messrs. H.I.D. du Plessis and J.W. Grobbelaar of Unisa, and Peter C. Pirow, R.T. Rozwadowski and J.C. Joslin of Johannesburg. ORSSA was then founded in Johannesburg on Thursday, 20 November 1969. About 150 individuals were present, coming from all parts of South Africa and the Rhodesia of that time (Zimbabwe). The following office bearers were elected in terms of the newly adopted constitution: Dr. H.S. Sichel (President), Mr. J.W. Grobbelaar (Vice-President), Mr. J.C. Joslin (Secretary), Mr. D.D. Masterson (Treasurer), Mr. M.C.F. (Mike) King (Editor), and Profs. G.J. Rudolph and C.G. Troskie (Additional Members).<ref>Grobbelaar, Jos. 1990. \"Nog herinneringe uit die ou dae.\" Newsletter of ORSSA/Nuusbrief van ONSA, July/Julie, 10-12.</ref><ref>Pirow, P.C. 1969. Notule van vergadering gehou in die Dorothy Susskind Gehoorsaal om 4:00 nm. op Donderdag 20 November 1969. Johannesburg.</ref> The new society was privileged to get an excellent management team under the leadership of Dr. Sichel, who was known internationally for his work in mining statistics.\n\nTom Rozwadowski was one of the main driving forces behind the founding meeting of ORSSA, and he also made major contributions at the founding meeting itself. He worked for Control Data Corporation (CDC). In 1970 CDC transferred him to their head office in Minneapolis to enable him to work towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science. He and his wife and children went on a weekend outing to Annandale, near Minneapolis, where he was to address a meeting of the Roman Catholic Church on South Africa. Due to a tragic gas leak, the entire family died at their stopover place. At the Annual General Meeting of ORSSA in 1970 it was announced that in memory of him an annual Tom Rozwadowski Medal would be made available for a paper of outstanding merit delivered by a member of ORSSA [8].<ref>Anonymous. 1972. ORSSA/ONSA Newsletter/Nuusbrief, October/Oktober.</ref> This coveted and prestigious medal of ORSSA was first awarded in 1971, to Dr. Gerhard Rudolph.\n\nThe Johannesburg Branch was the first chapter of ORSSA. A new Pretoria Chapter was founded on 19 March 1970. The Western Cape Branch was founded on 14 August 1972. Branch chairmen also served on the national Executive Committee of ORSSA. One of the main tasks of the Executive Committee in its first year was to decide on membership issues. By 16 June 1970 membership had been granted to 75 individuals, of which 47 were for full membership and 28 for associate membership. The second annual congress of ORSSA was held in November 1970 at Iscor in Pretoria, where Jos Grobbelaar was elected as the new President. The other members of the new Executive Committee were D.D. Masterson (Vice-President), Dr. H.S. Sichel (Past President), Dr. J.D. Roode (Secretary), Dr. G.J. Rudolph (Treasurer), M.C.F. King (Editor), and J. Buttery and J.C. Joslin (Additional Members). In the new term of office two new branch chairmen also served in the Executive Committee, namely Dr. D.M. Hawkins (Johannesburg) and Dr. R.J. van den Heever (Pretoria).\n\nSince 1969 the society has had the following presidents: Dr H Sichel (1970), Mr JW Grobbelaar (1971), Mr D Masterson (1972), Dr GJ Rudolph (1973), Mr J Miller (1974), Mr K Sandrock (1975), Mr HID du Plessis (1976), Mr R Eales (1977), Prof TJ Stewart (1978), Prof JS Wolvaardt (1979), Dr MJ Venter (1980), Dr AH Money (1981), Mr M Splaine (1982), Mr D Masterson (1983), Dr LP Fatti (1984), Mr DW Evans (1985), Mr MA de Vries (1986), Mr HW Ittmann (1987), Prof G Erens (1988-1989), Ms A Pachyannis (1990-1991), Mr LA Visagie (1992-1993), Ms E Ferreira (1994-1995), Dr E Dixon (1996-1997), Prof JW Hearne (1998-1999), Dr PduT Fourie (2000-2001), Mr HW Ittmann (2002-2003), Prof WR Gevers (2004-2005), Ms KM Harmse (2006-2007), Prof VSS Yadavalli (2008-2009), Mr DW Evans (2010-2011), Prof JH van Vuuren (2012-2013), Prof HA Kruger (2014-2015), Mrs WC Pelser (2016-2017), Dr D L\u00f6tter (2018-2019), Ms Gemma Dawson (2020-2021).\n\n== Governance ==\n\nAt a national level the Society is managed by an Executive Committee (EC), which is elected annually at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Society. The various members of the EC each have a specific portfolio for which they are responsible. The portfolios entail, inter alia, membership aspects, finances, the publications of the society, interaction with international societies, the different chapters of ORSSA, the website, etc. The EC consists of the following office bearers: (i) The President, (ii) The Vice-President (either elected to become the next President or The Past President who last held office), (iii) The Secretary, (iv) The Treasurer, (v) The Database Manager, (vi) The Marketing Manager, (vii) The Newsletter Editor, (viii) The Newsletter Business Manager, (ix) The Journal Editor-in-Chief, (x) The Journal Manager, (xi) The Webmaster, a number of elected Additional Members, all Chapter Chairpersons and possibly further individuals co-opted by the EC with the aim of performing specific tasks.\n\nIn the larger centres of the country, activities of the Society are arranged by regional chapters. Currently the Society consists of the following five regional chapters:\n* the Johannesburg Chapter,\n* the Pretoria Chapter,\n* the Vaal Triangle Chapter,\n* the Western Cape Chapter, and\n* the Kwazulu-Natal Chapter.\nSeminars, workshops and panel discussions are arranged by these regional chapters on an annual basis. Case studies, theoretical work, new technology, etc. are typically presented and discussed at these get-togethers. OR is, of course, the main subject at these events, but topics in specific related areas of interest, such as statistics, decision support systems, expert systems, the management sciences and industrial engineering, are also covered.\n\n== Membership ==\n\nORSSA has about 350 members - individuals (students, professors and researchers from university and research institutions, as well as professionals from industry) and corporate affiliates. The society offers the following membership grades: Student, Full, Fellowship, Retired, Honorary life as well as Corporate membership. The first two membership grades are open for application by individual persons. The Corporate membership is open for application by companies or institutions. The third and fifth membership grade are by invitation only, and finally, a full member may apply for retired membership status.\n\n== Publications ==\n\nORiON is the official [[scholarly journal]] of ORSSA and has been published biannually since 1985.<ref>[http://orion.journals.ac.za/pub], ORiON journal website, retrieved 2016-07-20.</ref> The journal enjoys accreditation by the national Department of Education and hence qualifies for government subsidies to authors employed by academic institutions. An interesting mixture between theoretical and applied work is published in ORiON, which welcomes contributions in the following four broad categories:\n* new OR-related theory or methodologies,\n* success stories in OR,\n* OR case studies, and\n* OR methodological reviews.\nMembers of the Society automatically receive paper copies of this journal.\n\nThe Society also publishes a quarterly Newsletter.<ref>[http://www.orssa.org.za/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Newsletter], ORSSA, retrieved 2016-07-22.</ref> Apart from snippets of OR-related news, general OR articles and advertisements which are of interest to members, notices of forthcoming activities and reports on recent conferences are contained in the Newsletter. News items from the EC meetings and OR umbrella-organisations, such as IFORS and EURO, may also be found in the Newsletter.\n\n== Conferences ==\n\nA national conference is organised by the Society at different venues annually, usually during the month of September, to serve as a forum for communication about OR. An international expert or a prominent local operations researcher is usually invited as the keynote speaker. This is the premier annual meeting of the Society, and apart from a rich and varied programme of presentations by both practitioners and academics, the conference usually also boasts a very enjoyable social component.\n\n== Awards ==\n\nThe Society awards a number of prizes and awards annually to recognise outstanding achievements in the field of Operations Research. The Tom Rozwadowski medal is the Society's premier award and has been awarded on an almost annual basis since 1971. The medal is awarded for the best written contribution to Operations Research published by a member of the Society during the previous year. The nominating committee invites nominations or submissions for consideration for this award.\n\nThe Executive Committee may also invite long-standing full members of the Society to become Fellows of the Society. These would include individuals who have served the Society in an exemplary manner for a considerable period of time, or who have served the science and profession of Operations Research over a considerable period of time. The Society also makes recognition awards to individuals who have served the profession of Operations Research in an exemplary fashion. A recognition award is a prestigious distinction and is reserved only for outstanding achievements and/or contributions typically over a long period of time.\n\nThe Society also hosts two student competitions on an annual basis. Tertiary institutions may nominate candidates, based on a written Operations Research project of Honours or Masters (or similar) level. These projects are evaluated by a panel of experts, and then a cash prize is awarded to the winner at the annual conference each year. Nominations usually close around June.\n\nIn 2019, the Society hosted its first science communication competition. Entries consist of three-minute science communication videos based on a research project, and are evaluated by a panel of experts. Cash prizes are awarded to the top two each year. The top 5 video's are available on [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNUdo_teFfJaIdMwStEo6A ORSSA's YouTube channel]. Gunther Husselmann, Dirk Human and Timothy Whitehead were the top three awarded in the first competition hosted.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.orssa.org.za/}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Operations research societies]]\n[[Category:Professional associations based in South Africa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox organization\n| name = ORSSA, Operations Research Society of South Africa\n| image = \n| formation     =  1969\n| status        = Society\n| purpose       = To promote operations research\n| region        = Africa\n| language      = English and Afrikaans\n| main_organ    = Executive Committee\n| parent_organization = [[Association of European Operational Research Societies]]\n| website       = {{url|www.orssa.org.za}} and {{url|http://orion.journals.ac.za}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Operations Research Society of South Africa''' ('''ORSSA''') ('''Afrikaans: Die Operasionele Navorsingsvereniging van Suid-Afrika''' ('''ONSA''')) is the national, professional body tasked with furthering the interests of those engaged in, or interested in, [[operations research]] (OR) activities in South Africa.<ref>{{citation|contribution= The Operations Research Society of South Africa|first=Hans W|last=Ittmann|first2=V.S.S|last2=Yadavalli|title=Wiley Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science_year=2010|doi=10.1002/9780470400531.eorms0602|year=2011|isbn=9780470400531}}.

An interesting mixture between theoretical and applied work is published in ORiON, which welcomes contributions in the following four broad categories:\n* new OR-related theory or methodologies,\n* success stories in OR,\n* OR case studies, and\n* OR methodological reviews.\nMembers of the Society automatically receive paper copies of this journal.\n\nThe Society also publishes a quarterly Newsletter.<ref>[http://www.orssa.org.za/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Newsletter], ORSSA, retrieved 2016-07-22.</ref> Apart from snippets of OR-related news, general OR articles and advertisements which are of interest to members, notices of forthcoming activities and reports on recent conferences are contained in the Newsletter. News items from the EC meetings and OR umbrella-organisations, such as IFORS and EURO, may also be found in the Newsletter.\n\n== Conferences ==\n\nA national conference is organised by the Society at different venues annually, usually during the month of September, to serve as a forum for communication about OR. An international expert or a prominent local operations researcher is usually invited as the keynote speaker. This is the premier annual meeting of the Society, and apart from a rich and varied programme of presentations by both practitioners and academics, the conference usually also boasts a very enjoyable social component.\n\n== Awards ==\n\nThe Society awards a number of prizes and awards annually to recognise outstanding achievements in the field of Operations Research. The Tom Rozwadowski medal is the Society's premier award and has been awarded on an almost annual basis since 1971. The medal is awarded for the best written contribution to Operations Research published by a member of the Society during the previous year. The nominating committee invites nominations or submissions for consideration for this award.\n\nThe Executive Committee may also invite long-standing full members of the Society to become Fellows of the Society. These would include individuals who have served the Society in an exemplary manner for a considerable period of time, or who have served the science and profession of Operations Research over a considerable period of time. The Society also makes recognition awards to individuals who have served the profession of Operations Research in an exemplary fashion. A recognition award is a prestigious distinction and is reserved only for outstanding achievements and/or contributions typically over a long period of time.\n\nThe Society also hosts two student competitions on an annual basis. Tertiary institutions may nominate candidates, based on a written Operations Research project of Honours or Masters (or similar) level. These projects are evaluated by a panel of experts, and then a cash prize is awarded to the winner at the annual conference each year. Nominations usually close around June.\n\nIn 2019, the Society hosted its first science communication competition. Entries consist of three-minute science communication videos based on a research project, and are evaluated by a panel of experts. Cash prizes are awarded to the top two each year. The top 5 video's are available on [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNUdo_teFfJaIdMwStEo6A]. Gunther Husselmann, Dirk Human and Timothy Whitehead were the top three awarded in the first competition hosted.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.orssa.org.za/}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Operations research societies]]\n[[Category:Professional associations based in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Linkepotgieter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAwards", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Society_of_South_Africa"}

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n \n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened(or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023.

cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] with direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n \n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened(or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire}}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* [[Camp Hill Line]], West Midlands, due to reopen in 2021 \n* [[South Staffordshire line|Stourbridge
