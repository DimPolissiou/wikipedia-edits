However, these schools were closed down at the end of the war.\n\nIn 1962, following the [[Sino-Indian War]], India identified the need to expand the number of officers for effective operations. Two Officers Training Schools (OTS) were established in [[Pune]] and [[Madras]] (now known as Chennai) to train officers for Emergency Commission into the Army. The process of establishing the schools was begun in September 1962. The Chennai school was inaugurated on 15 January 1963, for nation by and with Brigadier Ram Singh as its first Commandant.<ref name=\"estd\">{{cite news|title=Pranab Mukherjee to review passing-out parade at Chennai OTA|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pranab-mukherjee-to-review-passingout-parade-at-chennai-ota/article9040488.ece|accessdate=28 August 2016|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=27 August 2016|location=[[Chennai]]|language=en-IN}}</ref> The Pune school had a short run and was closed in 1964. However, the school in Chennai continued to operate and on 2 February 1965, it obtained the sanction to shift focus to train officers for the Short Service Regular Commission. OTA Chennai is spread over {{convert|750|acre|km2}}.\n\nThe Short Service Regular Commission has evolved into the Short Service Commission, and the OTS has continued to train officers for these commissions. The school was granted permanent status in 1985. On 1 January 1988, the school was renamed as the Officers Training Academy (OTA), on a par with the NDA and IMA.\n\nThe first batch of 25 women to be commissioned as officers into the Army were trained at the OTA, with training commencing on 21 September 1992.<ref name=samachar-grooming>{{cite web|url=http://mod.nic.in/Samachar/15may/html/aycom.htm|title=OTA: Grooming Leaders|publisher=Sainik Samachar, Ministry of Defence|date=15 May 2001|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nCadets are organised in seven companies(5+2).

The academy is located en route from Gaya to [[Bodhgaya]], approx 7&nbsp;km from Gaya railway station. The international airport of Gaya is adjacent to the academy. In its vicinity is Bodhgaya, an international tourism destination. Gaya Cantonment dates back to World War II, as one of the headquarters of the British Army.\n\nTo mark the commencement of the academy, a flag hoisting ceremony was solemnised and the consecration of the raising of the academy was carried out in true secular tradition of the Indian Army, with recital of scriptures from holy books of different religions.\n\nThe academy has been equipped with state of the art training facilities, at par with other pre-commissioning training institutions.\n\nThe insignia of Officers Training Academy, Gaya has a two-colour background, with upper half as grey and the lower half blood-red, having two cross swords superimposed with the Dharmchakra. A scroll below bears the motto of the academy \u2013 'Shaurya, Gyan, Sankalp' in devnagri.\n\nThe first batch of 149 trainee-officers underwent training in the academy during the period July 2011 to Jun 2012 and the first passing out parade was conducted on 8 June 2012. The second batch after successful completion of their training (January 2012 \u2013 December 2012) passed out on 8 December 2012. A total of 176 cadets from TES 26 and SCO 29 courses passed out on 8 December 2012. The academy currently has the capacity to train 350 cadets.

However, these schools were closed down at the end of the war.\n\nIn 1962, following the [[Sino-Indian War]], India identified the need to expand the number of officers for effective operations. Two Officers Training Schools (OTS) were established in [[Pune]] and [[Madras]] (now known as Chennai) to train officers for Emergency Commission into the Army. The process of establishing the schools was begun in September 1962. The Chennai school was inaugurated on 15 January 1963, for nation by and with Brigadier Ram Singh as its first Commandant.<ref name=\"estd\">{{cite news|title=Pranab Mukherjee to review passing-out parade at Chennai OTA|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pranab-mukherjee-to-review-passingout-parade-at-chennai-ota/article9040488.ece|accessdate=28 August 2016|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=27 August 2016|location=[[Chennai]]|language=en-IN}}</ref> The Pune school had a short run and was closed in 1964. However, the school in Chennai continued to operate and on 2 February 1965, it obtained the sanction to shift focus to train officers for the Short Service Regular Commission. OTA Chennai is spread over {{convert|750|acre|km2}}.\n\nThe Short Service Regular Commission has evolved into the Short Service Commission, and the OTS has continued to train officers for these commissions. The school was granted permanent status in 1985. On 1 January 1988, the school was renamed as the Officers Training Academy (OTA), on a par with the NDA and IMA.\n\nThe first batch of 25 women to be commissioned as officers into the Army were trained at the OTA, with training commencing on 21 September 1992.<ref name=samachar-grooming>{{cite web|url=http://mod.nic.in/Samachar/15may/html/aycom.htm|title=OTA: Grooming Leaders|publisher=Sainik Samachar, Ministry of Defence|date=15 May 2001|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nCadets are organised in seven companies(5+2). Jessami, Naushera, Kohima, Basantar & Meiktila companies are for officer cadets(males) and Zojila & Phillora companies are for lady cadets.\n\n===OTA Gaya===\nOTA Gaya, set up in 2011, is located amid an estate of approximately 870 acres in a hilly terrain of Paharpur at [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The academy is located en route from Gaya to [[Bodhgaya]], approx 7&nbsp;km from Gaya railway station. The international airport of Gaya is adjacent to the academy. In its vicinity is Bodhgaya, an international tourism destination. Gaya Cantonment dates back to World War II, as one of the headquarters of the British Army.\n\nTo mark the commencement of the academy, a flag hoisting ceremony was solemnised and the consecration of the raising of the academy was carried out in true secular tradition of the Indian Army, with recital of scriptures from holy books of different religions.\n\nThe academy has been equipped with state of the art training facilities, at par with other pre-commissioning training institutions.\n\nThe insignia of Officers Training Academy, Gaya has a two-colour background, with upper half as grey and the lower half blood-red, having two cross swords superimposed with the Dharmchakra. A scroll below bears the motto of the academy \u2013 'Shaurya, Gyan, Sankalp' in devnagri.\n\nThe first batch of 149 trainee-officers underwent training in the academy during the period July 2011 to Jun 2012 and the first passing out parade was conducted on 8 June 2012. The second batch after successful completion of their training (January 2012 \u2013 December 2012) passed out on 8 December 2012. A total of 176 cadets from TES 26 and SCO 29 courses passed out on 8 December 2012. The academy currently has the capacity to train 350 cadets.
