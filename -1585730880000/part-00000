It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n== Organization == \nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Storming of the Bastille]], which marked the beginning of [[French Revolution]], and was also seen a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. <ref>''L'Exposition de 1889 et la tour Eiffel, d'apr\u00e8s les documents officiels. 1889''. pp. 165-166</ref>  The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== Admission price ==\nAdmission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of a \"economy\" plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes.  Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions.  Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}  The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 Francs, while income was 49,500,000 Francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. These included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Britain and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte,''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', (in French), ''Le Mouvement Social'', number 149, 1989, page 15</ref>\n\n== Exposition Sites ==\n[[File:Plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1889.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the 1889 Exposition]].\n\nThe Exposition occupied two large sites.  The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology.

It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the [[Eiffel Tower]].  \n\n== Organization == \nThe Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Storming of the Bastille]], which marked the beginning of [[French Revolution]], and was also seen a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. <ref>''L'Exposition de 1889 et la tour Eiffel, d'apr\u00e8s les documents officiels. 1889''. pp. 165-166</ref>  The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== Admission price ==\nAdmission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of a \"economy\" plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes.  Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions.  Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}  The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 Francs, while income was 49,500,000 Francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=78}}\n\n== National Participation and boycotts ==\nThe countries which officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, Japan, Moroco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia,  Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay, The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.\n\nBecause of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition.  The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte, ''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', ''Le Mouvement social'' number 149, 1989, pg. 15 (in French)</ref>\n\nNonetheless, many citizens and companies from these countries did participate, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. These included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil. China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, Britain and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.<ref>Schroeder-Gudehus, Brigitte,''Les grandes puissances devant l\u2019Exposition universelle de 1889'', (in French), ''Le Mouvement Social'', number 149, 1989, page 15</ref>\n\n== Exposition Sites ==\n[[File:Plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Exposition Universelle de 1889.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of the 1889 Exposition]].\n\nThe Exposition occupied two large sites.  The main site was on [[Champs de Mars]] on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the [[Ecole Militaire]], and had been occupied by the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exposition]].  This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the [[Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro|Trocadero Palace]], which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition.  The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. \n\nA separate, smaller site was located esplanade of [[Les Invalides]], which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a  large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes, with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. This was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank.  This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called \"The History of Human Habitation\", with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], architect of the [[Paris Opera]].\n\nThere were twenty-two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter.  They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants.  The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.<ref>Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay catalog (11989) pg. 105 </ref>\n\n== Views of the Exposition ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537199 (3784839428).jpg|The main entrance of the Exposition \nFile:CLC 528 - PARIS - Galerie des Machines.JPG|Postcard of trams stopping at the [[Galerie des Machines]], at the edge of the Exposition\nFile:Tour Eiffel 3b40739.jpg|Exposition seen from a balloon (1889) \nFile:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Paris Exposition, view from ground level of the Eiffel tower with Parisians promenading, 1889.jpg|View under the Eiffel Tower toward the Central Dome\nFile:La Tour Eiffel from North of the Trocadero, 1889 - Flickr 14382709664.jpg|View of Exposition from Trocadero\nFile:Street view, looking toward Palais des Invalides, showing pavilions on L'Esplanade des Invalides, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilions on the Esplanade des Invalides, with [[Les Invalides]] in the background\nFile:Exposition Universal 1889 Paris France.jpg|View of the Central Dome\n</gallery>\n\n== Structures ==\n=== The Eiffel Tower ===\nThe [[Eiffel Tower]], built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called  \"A tower of three hundred meters\" with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It  was won by the construction firm of [[Gustave Eiffel]], which had recently built the iron frame of the [[Statue of Liberty]].  The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884,  had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.  The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.  Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms.  A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n\nThe construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in [[Levallois-Perret]], a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared,  \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"  During the Exposition, No one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nIn the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform,  though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E4DE1030E633A2575AC1A9639C94689FD7CF|title=The Great French Show|date=1889-05-19|work=The New York Times|pages=Front Page|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}} \n\nWhen the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer [[Edouard Branly]], be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=86}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Construction tour eiffel5.JPG|The tower under construction a year before the opening  (1888)\nFile:Les escaliers de la Tour Eiffel, au-dessus de la deuxi\u00e8me plate-forme, 1889.jpg|Stairway to the viewing level\nFile:Gustave Eiffel posant au sommet de la tour.jpg|[[Gustave Eiffel]] (left) posing on the stairway of his tower\nFile:Eiffel-Otis lift-poyet.jpg|The Otis elevators that carried visitors up the north and south legs of the tower\nFile:View of Exposition Universelle from Eiffel Tower, Paris, 1889.jpg|View of the Seine and the Exposition from the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Georges Garen embrasement tour Eiffel.jpg|Chromolithograph by George Garen of the Eiffel Tower illuminations (1889)\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Gallery of Machines ===\nA second monumental building on the site was the [[Galerie des machines]], by the architect [[Ferdinand Dutert]] and engineer [[Victor Contamin]], which had originally been built for the [[Universal Exposition of 1878]]. It was a huge iron and glass structure  which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land  between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 meters of glass windows.  At 111 meters, the Galerie covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=81}}   It was later used again at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle of 1900]] and then destroyed in 1910.  \n\nThe Galerie of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in the History of Civil Engineering|author= Stamper, John W.|volume=10|editor=  |year=2000|quote=The principal material of the building\u2019s structure was to have been steel, but the decision was made at the last minute to use iron instead. William Watson, an American engineer who wrote a thorough report on the fair after it closed states that the idea of using steel was abandoned \"on the two-fold ground of expense and the necessity of hastening the execution of work. \" The price of iron was about two-thirds that of steel in 1889.}}</ref><ref> There is an extensive description, with illustrations, of the Exposition's two famous buildings in the British journal ''Engineering'' (3 May 1889 issue). A follow-up report appears a late issue with this summation:</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Engineering|date=14 June 1889|title=The File:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpgParis Exhibition|page=677 }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Interior of exhibition building, Exposition Universal, Paris, France.jpg|Interior of the Galerie des machines (1889) \nFile:Central Dome of the Gallery des Machines Exposition Universelle de Paris 1889 by Louis Beroud 1852 1930.jpg|Interior of the central dome of the Gallerie des machines, by [[Louis B\u00e9roud]] (1889)\n\n</gallery>\n\n===Science and technology===\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality. \n\nAnother new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, [[Otis Elevator]]. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe.  The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.\n\nThere were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.  \n\nPrefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition.  Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel,  and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina.   Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers,  can now be found in the Forest of [[Dampierre-en-Yvelines|Dampierre]]. {{Sfn|Ageorges (2006)|page=98-99}} \n\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Le phonographe Edison, \u00e0 la section des \u00c9tats-Unis.jpg|Edison [[phonograph]] demonstrated at the Exposition \nFile:La Tour Eiffel.

Both were designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]] with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. \n\nThe Exposition  included a building by the Paris architect [[Pierre-Henri Picq]].  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort de France]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Les charpentes des Palais des beaux-arts et des arts lib\u00e9raux au Champ-de-Mars.jpg|The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts under construction, both designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Gezicht in tentoonstellingszaal van de Wereldtentoonstelling van 1889 in Parijs Exposition Universelle de 1889 (titel op object), RP-F-F16653.jpg|Interior of the Palace of Fine Arts by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]]\nFile:Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France-LCCN2001698574.jpg|The Palace of Fine Arts\nFile:Le Palais des arts lib\u00e9raux, Vue en perspective de l'ensemble des galeries.jpg|Inerior of the Palace of Liberal Arts\nFile:Interior of Paris Exposition building showing two balloons LCCN2002717992.tif|Interior of the Palace of Liberal Arts, with balloons\n</gallery>\n\n===Fountains===\nThe Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled \"The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.\"  The fountain was designed by [[Jean-Camille Formig\u00e9]], who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts.  The other major fountain, not far away, was \"The Five Parts of the World\", illustrating the continents.  It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Fountain Coutan and the Central Dome, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|The Coutan Fountain and central dome \n</gallery>\n\n=== The \"Street of Cairo\" and exotic habitations===\nThe Rue de Caire (\"Street of Cairo\") was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of [[Cairo]].  It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it.  It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl\u00e9on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the [[Suez Canal]].  It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings,  a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo.  The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.\n\nThe Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:La rue du Caire.

The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. \n\nThe Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect [[Albert Ballu]], who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments.  After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to [[Buenos Aires]], where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}} \n\n\nIn addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electrify pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. \nThe Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products.  One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from [[Champagne Mercier]] that could hold two thousand bottles of  champagne, {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay catalog (1989) page 261}}\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pabellon-argentino plazasmartin 1900.jpg|The Pavilion of Argentina, winner of the contest for best national pavilion\nFile:Pabell\u00f3n chileno en la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds de 1889-cropped.jpg|Pavilion of Chile\nFile:Pavilion of Brazil, Paris Exposition, 1889 LCCN92520980.jpg|Pavilion of Brazil \nFile:Paris Exposition train 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Algeria, with the Exposition train \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537046 (3784010239).jpg|Pavilion of Persia \nFile:Pavilion of India, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of India \nFile:Pavilion of Siam, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Siam \nFile:Palais du Mexican, Paris Exposition, 1889 (14382646444).jpg|Pavilion of Mexico\nFile:Pavilion of Nicaragua and base of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of Nicaragua\nFile:\u00a8Pavillon des \u00eeles Hawa\u00ef - Exposition universelle Paris 1889.jpg|Paviiion of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] \nFile:Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, Paris Exposition, 1889.jpg|Pavilion of the Suez Canal Company, in Egyptian style\nFile:Le palais des produits alimentaires, Exposition universelle 1889.jpg|The Palace of Food Products\nFile:Epernay fass mercier side view.jpg|A gigantic oak barrel with a capacity of 200 000 bottles of champagne was a feature of the [[Champagne Mercier]] exhibit at the food and wine pavilion. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Charles Garnier's ''History of Habitation'' ===\nAn unusual display was the \"History of Habitation\" designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] named for him. He was then sixty-one, and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera.  He had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, denouncing the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity. Despite this, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation.  These houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n\nThe houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas.  These dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historic accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular.  The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition. {{Sfn|Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, Catalog of Exposition (1989), pg. 132-135}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 \"Casa egipcia\" (3784820432).jpg|The Egyptian House of the History of Habitation, by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537073 (3784014313).jpg|The Aztec House and Incan House by Charles Garnier \nFile:Revista de la Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Par\u00eds, 1889 537049 (3784820368).jpg|The Roman House and the Gallo-Roman House, by Charles Garnier\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nMany smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition.  The architect [[Hector Guimard]], then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy\u00e9res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren.  The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.\n\n{{quote|the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features.  In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now-a-days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.}}\n\n==Science and technology==\nOne important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. [[Thomas Edison]] visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph clearer better sound quality.

The most notable surivor was the [[Eiffel Tower]], which had been deliberately built on Paris city-owned land, to avoid demolition.\n\nThe Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq.  This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to [[Fort-de-France]] in [[Martinique]] and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schoelcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that [[Victor Schoelcher]] had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in [[Martinique]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Exposition Universelle (1878)]]\n*[[Champ de Mars, Paris]]\n*[[Colonial Exhibition]]\n*[[Human zoo]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Ageorges, Sylvain (2006), ''Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles'' (in French), Parigramme. {{ISBN|978-28409-6444-5}}\n* Jonnes, Jill, ''Eiffel's Tower'' (2013), Penguin Putnam {{ISBN|978-01431-1729-2}}\n* Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay,  ''1889 - La Tour Eiffel et l'Exposition Universelle'' (1989) (in French), \u00c9ditions de la R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris {{ISBN|2-7118-2244-3}} (Catalog of a centennial exhibition on the Expositon in 1989) \n* ''Engineering'' [Journal] 3 May 1889 (vol XLVII), London: Office for Advertisements and Publication, 1866- (ISSN 0013-7782)\n* ''Structural iron and steel,'' 1850-1900, edited by Robert Thorne; Aldershot, Hampshire, Great Britain; Burlington, Vt., USA: Ashgate/Variorum, c2000 ({{ISBN|0860787591}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Exposition Universelle (1889)}}\n*Young, P.

Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional Commission on October 12, 1986 and was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite]] on February 2, 1987.\n\nThree other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history: the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution, the 1973 Constitution, and the 1986 Freedom Constitution.\n[[File:Gold_In-Laid_Chest_(Repository_of_1935_Constitution).jpg|thumb|1935 Constitution and its tabernacle displayed at [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], [[Quezon City]]]]\nThe earliest constitution establishing a \"Philippine Republic\", the 1899 [[Malolos Constitution]], was never fully implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized, due in great part to the eruption of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] following its adoption.\n\n==Background of the 1987 Constitution==\n{{main|Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986}}\nRuling by decree during the early months of her tenure as a president installed via the [[People Power Revolution]], President [[Corazon Aquino]] was granted three options: restore to 1935 Constitution, retain and make reforms to the 1973 Constitution, or pass a new constitution. She decided to draft a new constitution and issued Proclamation No. 3 on March 25, 1986, abrogating many of the provisions of th 1973 Constitution adopted during the Marcos regime, including the [[unicameral legislature]] (the [[Batasang Pambansa]]), the office of [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]], and provisions which gave the President legislative powers. Often called the \"Freedom Constitution\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chanrobles.com/aquinoproclamationo3.htm#.XeZXRXduLIU|title=1986 PROVISIONAL (FREEDOM) CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=chanrobles.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> this constitution was intended as a transitional constitution to ensure democracy and the freedom of the people. The Freedom Constitution provided for an orderly transfer of power while a [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986|Constitutional Commission]] was drafting a permanent constitution.\n\nThe Constitutional Commission was composed of forty-eight members appointed by Aquino from varied backgrounds, including several former members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], former justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], a Roman Catholic bishop, and political activists against the Marcos regime. The Commission elected [[Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz-Palma]], a former Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], as its president. Several issues were of particular contention during the Commission's sessions, including the form of government to adopt, the abolition of the death penalty, the retention of U.S. bases in [[Clark Air Base|Clark]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Base|Subic]], and the integration of economic policies into the constitution. [[Lino Brocka]], a film director and political activist who was a member of the Commission, walked out before the constitution's completion, and two other delegates dissented from the final draft. The Commission finished the final draft on October 12, 1986 and presented it to Aquino on October 15. The constitution was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite on February 8, 1987]].\n\nThe constitution provided for three governmental powers, namely the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial branches]]. The executive branch is headed by the president and his appointed cabinet members. The executive, same with the other two co-equal branches, has limited power. This is to ensure that the country will be \"safeguarded\" if martial law is to be declared. The president can still declare martial law, but it expires within 60 days and Congress can either reject or extend it.\n\nThe task of the Supreme Court is to review whether a declaration of martial law is just. The legislative power consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are twenty-four senators and the House is composed of district representatives. It also created opportunities for under-represented sectors of community to select their representative through party-list system. The judiciary branch comprises the Supreme Court and the lower courts. The Supreme Court is granted the power to hear any cases that deals with the constitutionality of law, about a treaty or decree of the government. It is also tasked to administrate the function of the lower courts.\n\nThrough the constitution, three independent Constitutional Commissions, namely the Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, and Commission on Audit, were created. These Constitutional Commissions have different functions. The constitution also paved a way for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, which has a function of promoting and ensuring an ethical and lawful conduct of the government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Readings in Philippine History|last=Candelaria and Alphora|first=Jhon Lee and Veronica|publisher=Rex Book Store, Inc.|year=2018|isbn=978-971-23-8665-7|location=Recto Avenue, Manila, Philippines|pages=71\u201382}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts to amend or change the 1987 Constitution ==\nThere are three possible methods by which the [[Constitution]] can be amended: a [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]] (Con-Ass), [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] (Con-Con), or [[People's Initiative]].

A constitution was drafted by then-Secretary of [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]] [[Jose T. Almonte|Jose Almonte]], but was never completed because it was exposed to the media by different non-government organizations. They saw through a potential change regarding the protection of the people's interests in the constitutional draft.\n\nIn 1997, the Pedrosa couple created a group called PIRMA followed with an attempt to change the constitution through a People's Initiative by way of gathering signatures from voters. Many prominent figures opposed the proposition, including Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago|Miriam Defensor-Santiago]], who brought the issue all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and eventually won the case. The Supreme Court ruled that the initiative not continue, stating that a People's Initiative requires an enabling law for it to push through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1997/mar1997/gr_127325_1997.html|title=G.R.

The attempt never attained its purpose after various entities opposed it due apparently to the attempt serving the personal interests of the initiators.\n\nAfter the Estrada presidency, the administration of [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] endorsed constitutional changes via a Constitutional Assembly, with then-House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia Jr.|Jose de Venecia]] leading the way. However, due to political controversies surrounding Arroyo's administration, including the possibility of term extension, the proposal was shut down.\n\nThe next attempt was from then-Speaker of the House [[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.|Feliciano Belmonte Jr]]. during President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration. Belmonte attempted to introduce amendments to the Constitution focusing on economic provisions aiming toward liberalization.

It follows the pattern in past constitutions, including an appeal to God. The preamble reads:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/#preamble|title=1987 Constitution of the Philippines,Preamble|publisher=}}</ref>{{quotation|We, the sovereign Filipino people, imploring the aid of Almighty God, in order to build a just and humane society and establish a Government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality, and peace, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.|4 = }}\n\n=== Article I \u2013 National Territory ===\nThe national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial, and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\n\n===Article II \u2013 Declaration of Principles and State Policies===\nArticle II lays out the basic social and political creed of the Philippines, particularly the implementation of the constitution and sets forth the objectives of the government. Some essential provisions are:\n\n* The Philippines is a democratic republic\n* Renunciation of war as a form of national policy\n* Supremacy of civilian over military authority\n* Separation of church and state (inviolable)\n* Pursuit of an independent foreign policy\n* Abrogation of nuclear weaponry\n* Family as the basic unit of the state\n* Role of youth and women in nation-building\n* Autonomy of local governments\n* Equal opportunity for public services and the prohibition of political dynasties\n\n===Article III \u2013 Bill of Rights===\nArticle III enumerates specific protections against the abuse of state power, most of which are similar to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Some essential provisions are:\n* a [[right to due process]] and [[equality before law|equal protection of law]]\n* a right against [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] without a warrant issued by a judge\n* a [[right to privacy]]\n* The right to [[freedom of speech and expression]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and the [[right to petition]]\n* The [[free exercise of religion]]\n* a [[right of abode]] and the [[right to travel]]\n* a [[right to information]] on matters of public concern\n* a [[freedom of association|right to form associations]]\n* a right of free access to courts\n* the [[right to remain silent]] and to have competent [[legal counsel]]\n* a [[right to bail]] and against excessive bail conditions\n* a right to ''[[habeas corpus]]''\n* the [[right to a speedy trial]]\n* the [[right against self-incrimination]]\n* the [[Freedom of thought|right to political beliefs]] and aspirations\n* a prohibition against [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, degrading, or inhuman punishment]]\n* protection providing for no [[Debt bondage|imprisonment for debt]]\n* the right against [[double jeopardy]]\n* prohibition of [[ex post facto law]]s and [[bills of attainder]].\nSimilar to U.S. jurisprudence and other common law jurisdictions, the scope and limitations of these rights have largely been determined by the Supreme Court through case law.\n\n=== Article IV \u2013 Citizenship ===\n\nArticle IV defines the citizenship of Filipinos. It enumerates two kinds of citizens: natural-born citizens and naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship. The Philippines follows a ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' system where citizenship is mainly acquired through a blood relationship with Filipino citizens.\n\nNatural-born citizenship forms an important part of the political system as only [[Philippine nationality law|natural-born Filipinos]] are eligible to hold high offices, including all elective offices beginning with a representative in the House of Representatives up to the President.\n\n===Article V \u2013 Suffrage===\nArticle V mandates various age and residence qualifications to vote and a system of secret ballots and absentee voting. It also mandates a procedure for overseas and disabled and illiterate Filipinos to vote.\n\n=== Article VI \u2013 Legislative Department ===\n\nArticle VI provides for a bicameral legislature called the Congress composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The Court, for example, has ruled that a provision requiring that the State \"guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service\" could not be enforced without accompanying legislation, and thus could not bar the disallowance of so-called \"nuisance candidates\" in presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/apr2004/161872.htm\n|title=Pamatong vs. Comelec (G.R.

On March 24, 1934, the United States passed the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] that allowed the nation to have self-government through a ten-year transitional period in preparation for full independence. The United States recognized Philippine independence in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]] on July 4, 1946.</ref> and therefore was under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Government of the United States]]. Two acts of the United States Congress passed during this period can be considered Philippine constitutions in that those acts defined the fundamental political principles and established the structure, procedures, powers and duties of the Philippine government.\n\n====Philippine Organic Act of 1902====\nThe [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act of 1902]], sometimes known as the \"Philippine Bill of 1902\" or the \"Cooper Act\", was the first [[organic law]] for the Philippine Islands enacted by the United States Congress. It provided for the creation of a popularly elected [[Philippine Assembly]], and specified that legislative power would be vested in a bicameral legislature composed of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] (upper house) and the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its key provisions included a [[bill of rights]] for the Filipinos and the appointment of two non-voting Filipino [[Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] to represent the Philippines in the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\n====Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916====\nThe [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916]], sometimes known as the \"Jones Law\", modified the structure of the Philippine government by removing the Philippine Commission as the legislative upper house and replacing it with a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] elected by Filipino voters, creating the Philippines' first fully elected national legislature. This act also explicitly stated that it was and always had been the purpose of the people of the United States to renounce their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize Philippine independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\n\n====Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act (1932)====\n\nThough not a constitution itself, the [[Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act]] of 1932 was the precursor the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act, which laid down the promise of independence to the Philippines after 10 years of transition period and other provisions; however, because of infighting within the Philippine Congress, it was not ratified and only became the basis for the creation of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act.\n\n====Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act (1934)====\nThough also not a constitution itself, the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] of 1934 provided for autonomy and defined mechanisms for the establishment of a formal constitution via a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n{{anchor|1935 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1935 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1935)}}\nThe 1935 Constitution was written, approved and adopted in 1934 by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935\u20131946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946\u20131972). It was written with an eye to meeting the approval of the [[United States Government]] as well, so as to ensure that the U.S. would live up to its promise to grant the Philippines independence and not have a premise to hold onto its possession on the grounds that it was too politically immature and hence unready for full, real independence. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution was ratified to prepare the country for its independence. This constitution was dominantly influenced by the Americans, but possess the traces of the Malolos Constitution, the German, Spanish, and Mexican Constitution, constitutions of several South American countries, and the unwritten English Constitution.\n\nIt originally provided for a unicameral legislature composed of a president and vice president elected for a six-year term without re-election. It was amended in 1940 to provide for a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The President is to be elected to a four-year term, together with the Vice-President, with one re-election; the right of suffrage for male citizens of the Philippines who are twenty-one years of age or over and are able to read and write were protected; this protection, later on, extended to the right of suffrage for women two years after the adoption of the constitution.\n\nThe draft of the constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935 and was ratified by President Roosevelt in Washington D.C. on March 25, 1935. Elections were held on September 16, 1935 and Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall embody their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a regime of justice, liberty, and democracy, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe original 1935 Constitution provided for a unicameral National Assembly, and the President was elected to a six-year term without the possibility re-election. It was [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] in 1940 to have a bicameral Congress composed of a Senate and House of Representatives, as well the creation of an independent [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|electoral commission]] and to grant the President a four-year term with a maximum of two consecutive terms in office.\n\nA [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1971 to rewrite the 1935 Constitution. The convention was stained with manifest bribery and corruption. Possibly the most controversial issue was removing the presidential term limit so that [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] could seek re-election for a third term, which many felt was the true reason for which the convention was called. In any case, the 1935 Constitution was suspended in 1972 with Marcos' proclamation of [[martial law]], the rampant corruption of the constitutional process providing him with one of his major premises for doing so. \n{{anchor|1943 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1943 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1943)}}\n[[File:Laurel addresses National Assembly to approve 1943 Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, President of the Second Philippine Republic, addresses the National Assembly in what is now the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]] to approve the 1943 Constitution.]]\nThe 1943 Constitution was drafted by a committee appointed by the [[Philippine Executive Commission]], the body established by the Japanese to administer the Philippines in lieu of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] which had established a [[government-in-exile]]. In mid-1942, Japanese Premier [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] promised the Filipinos \"the honor of independence\" which meant that the commission would be supplanted by a formal republic.\n\nThe [[Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence]] tasked with drafting a new constitution was composed, in large part, of members of the prewar National Assembly and of individuals with experience as delegates to the convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. Their draft for the republic to be established under the Japanese occupation, however, would be limited in duration, provide for indirect, instead of direct, legislative elections, and an even stronger executive branch.\n\nUpon the approval of the draft by the Committee, the new charter was ratified in 1943 by an assembly of appointed, provincial representatives of the [[Kalibapi]], the organization established by the Japanese to supplant all previous political parties. Upon the ratification by the Kalibapi assembly, the Second Republic was formally proclaimed (1943\u20131945). [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] was elected President by the National Assembly and sworn into office on October 14, 1943. Laurel was highly regarded by the Japanese for having openly criticized the U.S. for the way that they governed the Philippines and because he had a degree from the [[Tokyo International University]].\n\nThe 1943 Constitution remained in force in Japanese-controlled areas of the Philippines, but was never recognized as legitimate or binding by the governments of the United States, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or the guerrilla organizations loyal to them. In late 1944, President Laurel declared war on the United States and the [[British Empire]] and proclaimed [[martial law]], essentially ruling by decree. His government, in turn, went into exile in December 1944, first to [[Taiwan]] and then Japan. After the announcement of Japan's surrender, Laurel formally dissolved the Second Republic.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence and desiring to lead a free national existence, do hereby proclaim their independence, and in order to establish a government that shall promote the general welfare, conserve and develop the patrimony of the Nation, and contribute to the creation of a world order based on peace, liberty, and moral justice, do ordain this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe 1943 Constitution provided for strong executive powers. The Legislature consisted of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly and only those considered to be anti-US could stand for election, although in practice most legislators were appointed rather than elected.\n{{anchor|1973 constitution}}\n\nUntil the 1960s, the Second Republic and its officers were not viewed as a legitimate Philippine government or as having any standing with the exception of the Second Republic-era Supreme Court, whose decisions, limited to reviews of criminal and commercial cases as part of a policy of discretion by Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Yulo]], continued to be part of official records. This was made easier by the Commonwealth government-in-exile never constituting a Supreme Court, and the formal vacancy in the position of Chief Justice for the Commonwealth with the execution of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] by the Japanese. It was only during the Macapagal administration that a partial political rehabilitation of the Japanese-era republic took place, with the official recognition of Laurel as a former president and the addition of his cabinet and other officials to the roster of past government officials. However, the 1943 Constitution was not taught in schools, and the laws of the 1943\u201344 National Assembly were never recognized as valid or relevant.\n\n=== The 1973 Constitution ===\n{{see also|Ratification Cases}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1973)}}\nThe 1973 Constitution, promulgated after Marcos' [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of martial law]], was supposed to introduce a [[Parliamentary government|parliamentary-style government]]. Legislative power was vested in a [[unicameral]] National Assembly whose members were elected for six-year terms. The President was ideally elected as the symbolic and purely [[Figurehead|ceremonial]] [[head of state]] chosen from amongst the Members of the National Assembly for a six-year term and could be re-elected to an unlimited number of terms. Upon election, the President ceased to be a Member of the National Assembly. During his term, the President was not allowed to be a member of a [[political party]] or hold any other office.\n\nExecutive power was meant to be exercised by the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] who was also elected from among the sitting Assemblymen. The Prime Minister was to be the [[head of government]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]]. This constitution was subsequently amended four times (arguably five, depending on how one considers Proclamation No. 3 of 1986, see below).\n\nFrom 16\u201317 October 1976, a majority of [[barangay]] voters (also called \"Citizens' Assemblies\") approved that [[martial law]] should be continued and ratified the amendments to the Constitution proposed by President Marcos.{{refn|In Sanidad vs. Comelec, L-44640, October 12, 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that on the basis of absolute necessity both the constituent power (the power to formulate a Constitution or to propose amendments or revision to the Constitution and to ratify such proposal, which is exclusively vested to the National Assembly, the Constitutional Convention, and the electorate) and legislative powers of the legislature may be exercised by the Chief Executive.<ref>[http://berneguerrero.com/node/90 Summary: Sanidad vs. Commission on Elections (GR L-44640, 12 October 1976)], [http://berneguerrero.com/ berneguerrero.com].</ref><ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1976/oct1976/gr_44640_1976.html G.R. No. L-44640 October 12, 1976], [http://www.lawphil.net lawphil.net].</ref>}}\n\nThe 1976 amendments provided:\n* for an [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (IBP) substituting for the Interim National Assembly;\n* that the President would become Prime Minister and continue to exercise legislative powers until such time as martial law was lifted.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment authorized the President to legislate on his own on an \"emergency\" basis:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever in the judgement of the President there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the Interim Batasang Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any reason that in his judgment requires immediate action, he may, in order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees, orders or letters of instructions, which shall form part of the law of the land.</blockquote>\n\nThe 1973 Constitution was further amended in 1980 and 1981. In the 1980 amendment, the retirement age of the members of the judiciary was extended to 70 years. In the 1981 amendments, the false parliamentary system was formally modified into a [[Cabinet of France|French]]-style [[semi-presidential system]] and provided:\n* that executive power was restored to the President;\n* that direct election of the President was restored;\n* for an Executive Committee composed of the Prime Minister and not more than 14 members was created to \"assist the President in the exercise of his powers and functions and in the performance of his duties as he may prescribe;\" and the Prime Minister was a mere head of the Cabinet.\n* for electoral reforms and provided that a natural born citizen of the Philippines who has lost his citizenship may be a transference of private land for use by him as his residence.\n\nThe last amendments in 1984 abolished the Executive Committee and restored the position of [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] (which did not exist in the original, unamended 1973 Constitution).\n{{anchor|1986 constitution}}\n\nWhile the 1973 Constitution ideally provided for a true parliamentary system, in practice, Marcos made use of subterfuge and manipulation in order to keep executive powers for himself, rather than [[devolution|devolving]] these to the Assembly and the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The end result was that the final form of the 1973 Constitution &ndash; after all amendments and subtle manipulations &ndash; was merely the abolition of the Senate and a series of cosmetic rewording. The old American-derived terminology was replaced by names more associated with a parliamentary government: for example, the House of Representatives became known as the \"''Batasang Pambans\u00e2''\" (National Assembly), departments became \"ministries\", and their cabinet secretaries became known as \"cabinet ministers\", with the President's assistant &ndash; the Executive Secretary &ndash; now being styled as the \"Prime Minister\". Marcos' purported parliamentary system in practice functioned as an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[presidential system]], with all real power concentrated in the hands of the President but with the premise that such was now constitutional.\n\n=== The 1986 Freedom Constitution ===\n{{see also|Revolutionary government in the Philippines}}\n{{wikisource|Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)|Proclamation \u2116 3: Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)}}\nImmediately following the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos, President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]] issued Proclamation No. 3 as a [[provisional constitution]]. It adopted certain provisions from the 1973 Constitution while abolishing others. It granted the President broad powers to reorganize government and remove officials, as well as mandating the president to appoint a commission to draft a new, more formal Constitution.  This document, described above, supplanted the \"Freedom Constitution\" upon its [[ratification]] in 1987. This is the transitional constitution that lasted a year and came before the permanent constitution. It maintained many provisions of the 1973 [[Constitution]], including in rewritten form the presidential right to rule by decree. The Convention compose of 48 members appointed by the President.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Philippines charter change|Charter Change]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last= Cruz|first= Isagani|title= Constitutional Law|year= 1995|publisher= Central Lawbook Publishing Co., Inc.|location= Philippines  |isbn= 971-16-0333-0|pages= 18\u201320|chapter= The Nature of the Constitution}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gov.ph/constitution-day/ Evolution of Philippine Constitution]\n* [https://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/1986/04/19/corys-proclamation-no-3-april-19-1986/ Cory\u2019s Proclamation No. 3] by Napoleon G.

Its final draft was completed by the Constitutional Commission on October 12, 1986 and was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite]] on February 2, 1987.\n\nThree other constitutions have effectively governed the country in its history: the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution, the 1973 Constitution, and the 1986 Freedom Constitution.\n[[File:Gold_In-Laid_Chest_(Repository_of_1935_Constitution).jpg|thumb|1935 Constitution and its tabernacle displayed at [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], [[Quezon City]]]]\nThe earliest constitution establishing a \"Philippine Republic\", the 1899 [[Malolos Constitution]], was never fully implemented throughout the Philippines and did not establish a state that was internationally recognized, due in great part to the eruption of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] following its adoption.\n\n==Background of the 1987 Constitution==\n{{main|Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986}}\nRuling by decree during the early months of her tenure as a president installed via the [[People Power Revolution]], President [[Corazon Aquino]] was granted three options: restore to 1935 Constitution, retain and make reforms to the 1973 Constitution, or pass a new constitution. She decided to draft a new constitution and issued Proclamation No. 3 on March 25, 1986, abrogating many of the provisions of th 1973 Constitution adopted during the Marcos regime, including the [[unicameral legislature]] (the [[Batasang Pambansa]]), the office of [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]], and provisions which gave the President legislative powers. Often called the \"Freedom Constitution\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chanrobles.com/aquinoproclamationo3.htm#.XeZXRXduLIU|title=1986 PROVISIONAL (FREEDOM) CONSTITUTION OF THE PHILIPPINES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|website=chanrobles.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> this constitution was intended as a transitional constitution to ensure democracy and the freedom of the people. The Freedom Constitution provided for an orderly transfer of power while a [[Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986|Constitutional Commission]] was drafting a permanent constitution.\n\nThe Constitutional Commission was composed of forty-eight members appointed by Aquino from varied backgrounds, including several former members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], former justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], a Roman Catholic bishop, and political activists against the Marcos regime. The Commission elected [[Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz-Palma]], a former Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], as its president. Several issues were of particular contention during the Commission's sessions, including the form of government to adopt, the abolition of the death penalty, the retention of U.S. bases in [[Clark Air Base|Clark]] and [[Subic Bay Naval Base|Subic]], and the integration of economic policies into the constitution. [[Lino Brocka]], a film director and political activist who was a member of the Commission, walked out before the constitution's completion, and two other delegates dissented from the final draft. The Commission finished the final draft on October 12, 1986 and presented it to Aquino on October 15. The constitution was ratified by a [[1987 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|nationwide plebiscite on February 8, 1987]].\n\nThe constitution provided for three governmental powers, namely the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial branches]]. The executive branch is headed by the president and his appointed cabinet members. The executive, same with the other two co-equal branches, has limited power. This is to ensure that the country will be \"safeguarded\" if martial law is to be declared. The president can still declare martial law, but it expires within 60 days and Congress can either reject or extend it.\n\nThe task of the Supreme Court is to review whether a declaration of martial law is just. The legislative power consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. There are twenty-four senators and the House is composed of district representatives. It also created opportunities for under-represented sectors of community to select their representative through party-list system. The judiciary branch comprises the Supreme Court and the lower courts. The Supreme Court is granted the power to hear any cases that deals with the constitutionality of law, about a treaty or decree of the government. It is also tasked to administrate the function of the lower courts.\n\nThrough the constitution, three independent Constitutional Commissions, namely the Civil Service Commission, Commission on Elections, and Commission on Audit, were created. These Constitutional Commissions have different functions. The constitution also paved a way for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, which has a function of promoting and ensuring an ethical and lawful conduct of the government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Readings in Philippine History|last=Candelaria and Alphora|first=Jhon Lee and Veronica|publisher=Rex Book Store, Inc.|year=2018|isbn=978-971-23-8665-7|location=Recto Avenue, Manila, Philippines|pages=71-82}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts to amend or change the 1987 Constitution ==\nThere are three possible methods by which the [[Constitution]] can be amended: a [[Constituent assembly|Constituent Assembly]] (Con-Ass), [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] (Con-Con), or [[People's Initiative]].

They saw through a potential change regarding the protection of the people's interests in the constitutional draft.\n\nIn 1997, the Pedrosa couple created a group called PIRMA followed with an attempt to change the constitution through a People's Initiative by way of gathering signatures from voters. Many prominent figures opposed the proposition, including Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago|Miriam Defensor-Santiago]], who brought the issue all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and eventually won the case.

It follows the pattern in past constitutions, including an appeal to God. The preamble reads:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/#preamble|title=1987 Constitution of the Philippines,Preamble|publisher=}}</ref>{{quotation|We, the sovereign Filipino people, imploring the aid of Almighty God, in order to build a just and humane society and establish a Government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality, and peace, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.|4 = }}\n\n=== Article I \u2013 National Territory ===\nThe national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial, and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\n\n===Article II \u2013 Declaration of Principles and State Policies===\nArticle II lays out the basic social and political creed of the Philippines, particularly the implementation of the constitution and sets forth the objectives of the government. Some essential provisions are:\n\n* The Philippines is a democratic republic\n* Renunciation of war as a form of national policy\n* Supremacy of civilian over military authority\n* Separation of church and state (inviolable)\n* Pursuit of an independent foreign policy\n* Abrogation of nuclear weaponry\n* Family as the basic unit of the state\n* Role of youth and women in nation-building\n* Autonomy of local governments\n* Equal opportunity for public services and the prohibition of political dynasties\n\n===Article III \u2013 Bill of Rights===\nArticle III enumerates specific protections against the abuse of state power, most of which are similar to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Some essential provisions are:\n* a [[right to due process]] and [[equality before law|equal protection of law]]\n* a right against [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] without a warrant issued by a judge\n* a [[right to privacy]]\n* The right to [[freedom of speech and expression]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and the [[right to petition]]\n* The [[free exercise of religion]]\n* a [[right of abode]] and the [[right to travel]]\n* a [[right to information]] on matters of public concern\n* a [[freedom of association|right to form associations]]\n* a right of free access to courts\n* the [[right to remain silent]] and to have competent [[legal counsel]]\n* a [[right to bail]] and against excessive bail conditions\n* a right to ''[[habeas corpus]]''\n* the [[right to a speedy trial]]\n* the [[right against self-incrimination]]\n* the [[Freedom of thought|right to political beliefs]] and aspirations\n* a prohibition against [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel, degrading, or inhuman punishment]]\n* protection providing for no [[Debt bondage|imprisonment for debt]]\n* the right against [[double jeopardy]]\n* prohibition of [[ex post facto law]]s and [[bills of attainder]].\nSimilar to U.S. jurisprudence and other common law jurisdictions, the scope and limitations of these rights have largely been determined by the Supreme Court through case law.\n\n=== Article IV \u2013 Citizenship ===\n\nArticle IV defines the citizenship of Filipinos. It enumerates two kinds of citizens: natural-born citizens and naturalized citizens. Natural-born citizens are those who are citizens from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship. The Philippines follows a ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' system where citizenship is mainly acquired through a blood relationship with Filipino citizens.\n\nNatural-born citizenship forms an important part of the political system as only [[Philippine nationality law|natural-born Filipinos]] are eligible to hold high offices, including all elective offices beginning with a representative in the House of Representatives up to the President.\n\n===Article V \u2013 Suffrage===\nArticle V mandates various age and residence qualifications to vote and a system of secret ballots and absentee voting. It also mandates a procedure for overseas and disabled and illiterate Filipinos to vote.\n\n=== Article VI \u2013 Legislative Department ===\n\nArticle VI provides for a bicameral legislature called the Congress composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

It provides for the qualification, terms of office, election, and power and functions of the President. It also provides for a Vice President and for the presidential line of succession.\n\n=== Article VIII \u2013 Judicial Department ===\n\nArticle VIII vests the judicial power upon the Supreme Court and other lower courts as may be established by law (by Congress).

The Court, for example, has ruled that a provision requiring that the State \"guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service\" could not be enforced without accompanying legislation, and thus could not bar the disallowance of so-called \"nuisance candidates\" in presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/apr2004/161872.htm\n|title=Pamatong vs. Comelec (G.R.

On March 24, 1934, the United States passed the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] that allowed the nation to have self-government through a ten-year transitional period in preparation for full independence. The United States recognized Philippine independence in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]] on July 4, 1946.</ref> and therefore was under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Government of the United States]]. Two acts of the United States Congress passed during this period can be considered Philippine constitutions in that those acts defined the fundamental political principles and established the structure, procedures, powers and duties of the Philippine government.\n\n====Philippine Organic Act of 1902====\nThe [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act of 1902]], sometimes known as the \"Philippine Bill of 1902\" or the \"Cooper Act\", was the first [[organic law]] for the Philippine Islands enacted by the United States Congress. It provided for the creation of a popularly elected [[Philippine Assembly]], and specified that legislative power would be vested in a bicameral legislature composed of the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] (upper house) and the Philippine Assembly (lower house). Its key provisions included a [[bill of rights]] for the Filipinos and the appointment of two non-voting Filipino [[Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] to represent the Philippines in the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\n====Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916====\nThe [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916]], sometimes known as the \"Jones Law\", modified the structure of the Philippine government by removing the Philippine Commission as the legislative upper house and replacing it with a [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] elected by Filipino voters, creating the Philippines' first fully elected national legislature. This act also explicitly stated that it was and always had been the purpose of the people of the United States to renounce their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize Philippine independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\n\n===='''Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act (1932)'''====\n\nThough not a constitution itself, the [[Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act]] of 1932 was the precursor the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act, which laid down the promise of independence to the Philippines after 10 years of transition period and other provisions; however, because of infighting within the Philippine Congress, it was not ratified and only became the basis for the creation of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act.\n\n====Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act (1934)====\nThough also not a constitution itself, the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]] of 1934 provided for autonomy and defined mechanisms for the establishment of a formal constitution via a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]].\n{{anchor|1935 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1935 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1935)}}\nThe 1935 Constitution was written, approved and adopted in 1934 by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935\u20131946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946\u20131972). It was written with an eye to meeting the approval of the [[United States Government]] as well, so as to ensure that the U.S. would live up to its promise to grant the Philippines independence and not have a premise to hold onto its possession on the grounds that it was too politically immature and hence unready for full, real independence. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} \n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution was ratified to prepare the country for its independence. This constitution was dominantly influenced by the Americans, but possess the traces of the Malolos Constitution, the German, Spanish, and Mexican Constitution, constitutions of several South American countries, and the unwritten English Constitution.\n\nIt originally provided for a unicameral legislature composed of a president and vice president elected for a six-year term without re-election. It was amended in 1940 to provide for a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. The President is to be elected to a four-year term, together with the Vice-President, with one re-election; the right of suffrage for male citizens of the Philippines who are twenty-one years of age or over and are able to read and write were protected; this protection, later on, extended to the right of suffrage for women two years after the adoption of the constitution.\n\nThe draft of the constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935 and was ratified by President Roosevelt in Washington D.C. on March 25, 1935. Elections were held on September 16, 1935 and Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence, in order to establish a government that shall embody their ideals, conserve and develop the patrimony of the nation, promote the general welfare, and secure to themselves and their posterity the blessings of independence under a regime of justice, liberty, and democracy, do ordain and promulgate this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe original 1935 Constitution provided for a unicameral National Assembly, and the President was elected to a six-year term without the possibility re-election. It was [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] in 1940 to have a bicameral Congress composed of a Senate and House of Representatives, as well the creation of an independent [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|electoral commission]] and to grant the President a four-year term with a maximum of two consecutive terms in office.\n\nA [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1971 to rewrite the 1935 Constitution. The convention was stained with manifest bribery and corruption. Possibly the most controversial issue was removing the presidential term limit so that [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] could seek re-election for a third term, which many felt was the true reason for which the convention was called. In any case, the 1935 Constitution was suspended in 1972 with Marcos' proclamation of [[martial law]], the rampant corruption of the constitutional process providing him with one of his major premises for doing so. \n{{anchor|1943 constitution}}\n\n=== The 1943 Constitution ===\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1943)}}\n[[File:Laurel addresses National Assembly to approve 1943 Constitution.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel, President of the Second Philippine Republic, addresses the National Assembly in what is now the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]] to approve the 1943 Constitution.]]\nThe 1943 Constitution was drafted by a committee appointed by the [[Philippine Executive Commission]], the body established by the Japanese to administer the Philippines in lieu of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] which had established a [[government-in-exile]]. In mid-1942, Japanese Premier [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]] promised the Filipinos \"the honor of independence\" which meant that the commission would be supplanted by a formal republic.\n\nThe [[Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence]] tasked with drafting a new constitution was composed, in large part, of members of the prewar National Assembly and of individuals with experience as delegates to the convention that had drafted the 1935 Constitution. Their draft for the republic to be established under the Japanese occupation, however, would be limited in duration, provide for indirect, instead of direct, legislative elections, and an even stronger executive branch.\n\nUpon the approval of the draft by the Committee, the new charter was ratified in 1943 by an assembly of appointed, provincial representatives of the [[Kalibapi]], the organization established by the Japanese to supplant all previous political parties. Upon the ratification by the Kalibapi assembly, the Second Republic was formally proclaimed (1943\u20131945). [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] was elected President by the National Assembly and sworn into office on October 14, 1943. Laurel was highly regarded by the Japanese for having openly criticized the U.S. for the way that they governed the Philippines and because he had a degree from the [[Tokyo International University]].\n\nThe 1943 Constitution remained in force in Japanese-controlled areas of the Philippines, but was never recognized as legitimate or binding by the governments of the United States, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or the guerrilla organizations loyal to them. In late 1944, President Laurel declared war on the United States and the [[British Empire]] and proclaimed [[martial law]], essentially ruling by decree. His government, in turn, went into exile in December 1944, first to [[Taiwan]] and then Japan. After the announcement of Japan's surrender, Laurel formally dissolved the Second Republic.\n\nThe Preamble reads:\n\n:{{cquote|\"The Filipino people, imploring the aid of Divine Providence and desiring to lead a free national existence, do hereby proclaim their independence, and in order to establish a government that shall promote the general welfare, conserve and develop the patrimony of the Nation, and contribute to the creation of a world order based on peace, liberty, and moral justice, do ordain this Constitution.\"}}\n\nThe 1943 Constitution provided for strong executive powers. The Legislature consisted of a [[unicameral]] National Assembly and only those considered to be anti-US could stand for election, although in practice most legislators were appointed rather than elected.\n{{anchor|1973 constitution}}\n\nUntil the 1960s, the Second Republic and its officers were not viewed as a legitimate Philippine government or as having any standing with the exception of the Second Republic-era Supreme Court, whose decisions, limited to reviews of criminal and commercial cases as part of a policy of discretion by Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Yulo]], continued to be part of official records. This was made easier by the Commonwealth government-in-exile never constituting a Supreme Court, and the formal vacancy in the position of Chief Justice for the Commonwealth with the execution of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] by the Japanese. It was only during the Macapagal administration that a partial political rehabilitation of the Japanese-era republic took place, with the official recognition of Laurel as a former president and the addition of his cabinet and other officials to the roster of past government officials. However, the 1943 Constitution was not taught in schools, and the laws of the 1943\u201344 National Assembly were never recognized as valid or relevant.\n\n=== The 1973 Constitution ===\n{{see also|Ratification Cases}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the Philippines (1973)}}\nThe 1973 Constitution, promulgated after Marcos' [[Proclamation No. 1081|declaration of martial law]], was supposed to introduce a [[Parliamentary government|parliamentary-style government]]. Legislative power was vested in a [[unicameral]] National Assembly whose members were elected for six-year terms. The President was ideally elected as the symbolic and purely [[Figurehead|ceremonial]] [[head of state]] chosen from amongst the Members of the National Assembly for a six-year term and could be re-elected to an unlimited number of terms. Upon election, the President ceased to be a Member of the National Assembly. During his term, the President was not allowed to be a member of a [[political party]] or hold any other office.\n\nExecutive power was meant to be exercised by the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] who was also elected from among the sitting Assemblymen. The Prime Minister was to be the [[head of government]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]]. This constitution was subsequently amended four times (arguably five, depending on how one considers Proclamation \u2116 3 of 1986, see below).\n\nFrom 16\u201317 October 1976, a majority of [[barangay]] voters (also called \"Citizens' Assemblies\") approved that [[martial law]] should be continued and ratified the amendments to the Constitution proposed by President Marcos.{{refn|In Sanidad vs. Comelec, L-44640, October 12, 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that on the basis of absolute necessity both the constituent power (the power to formulate a Constitution or to propose amendments or revision to the Constitution and to ratify such proposal, which is exclusively vested to the National Assembly, the Constitutional Convention, and the electorate) and legislative powers of the legislature may be exercised by the Chief Executive.<ref>[http://berneguerrero.com/node/90 Summary: Sanidad vs. Commission on Elections (GR L-44640, 12 October 1976)], [http://berneguerrero.com/ berneguerrero.com].</ref><ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1976/oct1976/gr_44640_1976.html G.R. No. L-44640 October 12, 1976], [http://www.lawphil.net lawphil.net].</ref>}}\n\nThe 1976 amendments provided:\n* for an [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (IBP) substituting for the Interim National Assembly;\n* that the President would become Prime Minister and continue to exercise legislative powers until such time as martial law was lifted.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment authorized the President to legislate on his own on an \"emergency\" basis:\n\n<blockquote>Whenever in the judgement of the President there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or whenever the Interim Batasang Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any reason that in his judgment requires immediate action, he may, in order to meet the exigency, issue the necessary decrees, orders or letters of instructions, which shall form part of the law of the land.</blockquote>\n\nThe 1973 Constitution was further amended in 1980 and 1981. In the 1980 amendment, the retirement age of the members of the judiciary was extended to 70 years. In the 1981 amendments, the false parliamentary system was formally modified into a [[Cabinet of France|French]]-style [[semi-presidential system]] and provided:\n* that executive power was restored to the President;\n* that direct election of the President was restored;\n* for an Executive Committee composed of the Prime Minister and not more than 14 members was created to \"assist the President in the exercise of his powers and functions and in the performance of his duties as he may prescribe;\" and the Prime Minister was a mere head of the Cabinet.\n* for electoral reforms and provided that a natural born citizen of the Philippines who has lost his citizenship may be a transference of private land for use by him as his residence.\n\nThe last amendments in 1984 abolished the Executive Committee and restored the position of [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] (which did not exist in the original, unamended 1973 Constitution).\n{{anchor|1986 constitution}}\n\nWhile the 1973 Constitution ideally provided for a true parliamentary system, in practice, Marcos made use of subterfuge and manipulation in order to keep executive powers for himself, rather than [[devolution|devolving]] these to the Assembly and the cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The end result was that the final form of the 1973 Constitution &ndash; after all amendments and subtle manipulations &ndash; was merely the abolition of the Senate and a series of cosmetic rewording. The old American-derived terminology was replaced by names more associated with a parliamentary government: for example, the House of Representatives became known as the \"''Batasang Pambans\u00e2''\" (National Assembly), departments became \"ministries\", and their cabinet secretaries became known as \"cabinet ministers\", with the President's assistant &ndash; the Executive Secretary &ndash; now being styled as the \"Prime Minister\". Marcos' purported parliamentary system in practice functioned as an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[presidential system]], with all real power concentrated in the hands of the President but with the premise that such was now constitutional.\n\n=== The 1986 Freedom Constitution ===\n{{see also|Revolutionary government in the Philippines}}\n{{wikisource|Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)|Proclamation \u2116 3: Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1986)}}\nImmediately following the [[1986 People Power Revolution]] that ousted Marcos, President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]] issued Proclamation \u2116 3 as a [[provisional constitution]]. It adopted certain provisions from the 1973 Constitution while abolishing others. It granted the President broad powers to reorganize government and remove officials, as well as mandating the president to appoint a commission to draft a new, more formal Constitution.  This document, described above, supplanted the \"Freedom Constitution\" upon its [[ratification]] in 1987. This is the transitional constitution that lasted a year and came before the permanent constitution. It maintained many provisions of the 1973 [[Constitution]], including in rewritten form the presidential right to rule by decree. The Convention compose of 48 members appointed by the President.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Philippines charter change|Charter Change]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last= Cruz|first= Isagani|title= Constitutional Law|year= 1995|publisher= Central Lawbook Publishing Co., Inc.|location= Philippines  |isbn= 971-16-0333-0|pages= 18\u201320|chapter= The Nature of the Constitution}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gov.ph/constitution-day/ Evolution of Philippine Constitution]\n* [https://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/1986/04/19/corys-proclamation-no-3-april-19-1986/ Cory\u2019s Proclamation No. 3] by Napoleon G.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of the word '[[myna]]' and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex social groups.  Within each group there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds who are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests in the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'' which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of the word '[[myna]]' and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex social groups.  Within each group there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds who are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests in the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the ''declination'' ({{math|<var>D</var>}}) or ''variation''. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the ''inclination'' ({{math|<var>I</var>}}) or ''[[magnetic dip]]''. The ''intensity'' ({{math|<var>F</var>}}) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in {{math|<var>X</var>}} (North), {{math|<var>Y</var>}} (East) and {{math|<var>Z</var>}} (Down) coordinates.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n[[File:XYZ-DIS magnetic field coordinates.svg|500px|thumb|center|Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.]]\n\n====Intensity====\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in [[Gauss (unit)|gauss (G)]], but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1&nbsp;G = 100,000&nbsp;nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (\u03b3).<ref name=\"NGDC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml#What_are_the_magnetic_elements |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>   The [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is the [[SI]] unit of the magnetic field,  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000&nbsp;nT (0.25\u20130.65&nbsp;G).

As the [[Earth's magnetic field#Geographical variation|World Magnetic Model]] shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\" />\n\n====Inclination====\n{{main article|Magnetic dip}}\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90\u00b0 (up) to 90\u00b0 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0\u00b0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a [[dip circle]].\n\nAn ''isoclinic chart'' (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown [[#Geographical variation|below]].\n\n====Declination====\n{{main article|Magnetic declination}}\nDeclination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a [[celestial pole]]. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).\n\n===Geographical variation===\n<center>\nComponents of the Earth's magnetic field at the surface from the [[World Magnetic Model]] for 2015.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\">{{Cite report |last1=Chulliat |first1=A. |last2=Macmillan |first2=S. |last3=Alken |first3=P. |last4=Beggan |first4=C. |last5=Nair |first5=M. |last6=Hamilton |first6=B. |last7=Woods |first7=A. |last8=Ridley |first8=V. |last9=Maus  |first9=S. |last10=Thomson |first10=A. |date=2015 |title=The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020 |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/data/WMM2015/WMM2015_Report.pdf |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n</center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" align=\"center\" heights=\"155px\">\nFile:World Magnetic Field 2015.pdf|Intensity\nFile:World Magnetic Inclination 2015.pdf|Inclination\nFile:World Magnetic Declination 2015.pdf|Declination\n</gallery>\n\n===Dipolar approximation===\n[[File:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|The variation between magnetic north (N<sub>m</sub>) and \"true\" north (N<sub>g</sub>).]]\n{{see also|Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field}}\nNear the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.<ref name=\"NGDC\" /> The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar [[magnet]], with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Casselman |title=The Earth Has More Than One North Pole |newspaper=Scientific American |date=28 February 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-earth-has-more-than-one-north-pole |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense).

A magnet's  North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).<ref name=\"Serway\">{{cite book  | last = Serway  | first = Raymond A. |author2=Chris Vuille | title = Essentials of college physics | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2006 | location = USA | page = 493 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8n4NCyRgUMEC&pg=PA493 | isbn = 978-0-495-10619-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Emiliani\">{{cite book  | last = Emiliani | first = Cesare | title = Planet Earth: Cosmology, Geology, and the Evolution of Life and Environment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1992 | location = UK | page = 228 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MfAGpVq8gpQC&pg=PA228 | isbn = 978-0-521-40949-0}}</ref><ref name=\"Manners\">{{cite book  | last = Manners | first = Joy | title = Static Fields and Potentials | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2000 | location = USA | page = 148 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vJyqbRPsXYQC&pg=PA148 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0718-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Hyperphysics\">{{cite web | last = Nave | first = Carl R. | title = Bar Magnet | work = Hyperphysics | publisher = Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State Univ.  | year = 2010 | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html | accessdate = 2011-04-10}}</ref>  \n\nThe positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Wallace A. |last1=Campbell |title=\"Magnetic\" pole locations on global charts are incorrect |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |volume=77 |issue=36 |page=345 |year=1996 |doi=10.1029/96EO00237 |bibcode=1996EOSTr..77..345C |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a7bc65d5bf4b4accd44f7ad6e787f1d4428e078 }}</ref> The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |title=The Magnetic North Pole |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819061122/http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |archive-date=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90\u00b0 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90\u00b0 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe.  Movements of up to {{convert|40|km}} per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [[Boothia Peninsula]] in 1831 to {{convert|600|km}} from [[Resolute Bay]] in 2001.<ref name=\"inconstant\" /> The ''magnetic equator'' is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\n\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant [[Multipole expansion|non-dipolar]] contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Magnetosphere ==\n[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|An artist's rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere. 1)&nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]\n{{main article|Magnetosphere}}\n\nEarth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's [[corona]] and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000&nbsp;kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF).<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\">{{harvnb|Merrill|2010}}, pages 126\u2013141</ref>\n\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [[magnetopause]], the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10&nbsp;[[Earth radius|Earth radii]] out but the other side stretching out in a [[magnetotail]] that extends beyond 200&nbsp;Earth radii.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\nSunward of the magnetopause is the [[bow shock]], the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nInside the magnetosphere is the [[plasmasphere]], a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This region begins at a height of 60&nbsp;km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" /> There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;million [[Electronvolt|electron volts]] (MeV)). The inner belt is 1\u20132&nbsp;Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4\u20137&nbsp;Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Darrouzet |first1=Fabien |last2=De Keyser |first2=Johan |last3=Escoubet |first3=C.

Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar System by the Sun's magnetosphere, or [[heliosphere]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Shields Up!

Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [[ring current]]. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /> Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also emit [[X-rays]].<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\n\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [[space weather]], are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [[geomagnetic storm]]s, can occur when a [[coronal mass ejection]] erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [[Halloween solar storms, 2003|the \"Halloween\" storm of 2003]] damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |title=The great solar superstorm of 1859 |journal=Technology Through Time |volume=70 |year=2010 |url=http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2010/TTT/70.php |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Time dependence ==\n\n===Short-term variations===\n[[File:Magnetic Storm Oct 2003.jpg|thumb|'''Background''': a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a [[magnetic storm]] in 2000.<br /> '''Globe''': map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in [[Micro-|\u03bc]] [[Tesla (unit)|T]].]]\n\nThe geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years.

This [[remanent magnetization]], or ''remanence'', can be acquired in more than one way. In [[lava flow]]s, the direction of the field is \"frozen\" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a [[thermoremanent magnetization]]. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called ''detrital remanent magnetization''.<ref name=\"McElhinny2000\" />\n\nThermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, [[magma]] wells up from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.<ref name=\"McElhinny2000\" />\n\n[[Radiometric dating]] of lava flows has been used to establish a ''geomagnetic polarity time scale'', part of which is shown in the image.

If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nIn a perfect conductor (<math>\\sigma = \\infty\\;</math>), there would be no diffusion. By [[Lenz's law]], any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the ''frozen-in-field theorem''. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by [[convection]], motion driven by [[buoyancy]]. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called ''compositional convection''.

A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  ''Gauss coefficient'' {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients \u2013 {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}}, and {{math|<var>h</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}} \u2013 determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Radial dependence====\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>\u2113+1</sup>}} and one that ''increases'' with radius as {{math|<var>r</var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source ({{math|\u2113{{=}}1}}) drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>2</sup>}}. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>3</sup>}}. Quadrupole terms drop off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>4</sup>}}, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree {{math|14}} or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about {{convert|2000|km}} or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Global models====\nThe [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] maintains a standard global field model called the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]]. It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites ([[\u00d8rsted (satellite)|\u00d8rsted]], [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] and [[SAC-C]]) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finlay |first1=C.

A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the ''declination'' ({{math|<var>D</var>}}) or ''variation''. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the ''inclination'' ({{math|<var>I</var>}}) or ''[[magnetic dip]]''. The ''intensity'' ({{math|<var>F</var>}}) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in {{math|<var>X</var>}} (North), {{math|<var>Y</var>}} (East) and {{math|<var>Z</var>}} (Down) coordinates.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n[[File:XYZ-DIS magnetic field coordinates.svg|500px|thumb|center|Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.]]\n\n====Intensity====\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in [[Gauss (unit)|gauss (G)]], but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1&nbsp;G = 100,000&nbsp;nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (\u03b3).<ref name=\"NGDC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml#What_are_the_magnetic_elements |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>   The [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is the [[SI]] unit of the magnetic field,  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000&nbsp;nT (0.25\u20130.65&nbsp;G).

As the [[Earth's magnetic field#Geographical variation|World Magnetic Model]] shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\" />\n\n====Inclination====\n{{main article|Magnetic dip}}\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90\u00b0 (up) to 90\u00b0 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0\u00b0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a [[dip circle]].\n\nAn ''isoclinic chart'' (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown [[#Geographical variation|below]].\n\n====Declination====\n{{main article|Magnetic declination}}\nDeclination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a [[celestial pole]]. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).\n\n===Geographical variation===\n<center>\nComponents of the Earth's magnetic field at the surface from the [[World Magnetic Model]] for 2015.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\">{{Cite report |last1=Chulliat |first1=A. |last2=Macmillan |first2=S. |last3=Alken |first3=P. |last4=Beggan |first4=C. |last5=Nair |first5=M. |last6=Hamilton |first6=B. |last7=Woods |first7=A. |last8=Ridley |first8=V. |last9=Maus  |first9=S. |last10=Thomson |first10=A. |date=2015 |title=The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020 |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/data/WMM2015/WMM2015_Report.pdf |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n</center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" align=\"center\" heights=\"155px\">\nFile:World Magnetic Field 2015.pdf|Intensity\nFile:World Magnetic Inclination 2015.pdf|Inclination\nFile:World Magnetic Declination 2015.pdf|Declination\n</gallery>\n\n===Dipolar approximation===\n[[File:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|The variation between magnetic north (N<sub>m</sub>) and \"true\" north (N<sub>g</sub>).]]\n{{see also|Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field}}\nNear the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.<ref name=\"NGDC\" /> The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar [[magnet]], with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Casselman |title=The Earth Has More Than One North Pole |newspaper=Scientific American |date=28 February 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-earth-has-more-than-one-north-pole |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense).

A magnet's  North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).<ref name=\"Serway\">{{cite book  | last = Serway  | first = Raymond A. |author2=Chris Vuille | title = Essentials of college physics | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2006 | location = USA | page = 493 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8n4NCyRgUMEC&pg=PA493 | isbn = 978-0-495-10619-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Emiliani\">{{cite book  | last = Emiliani | first = Cesare | title = Planet Earth: Cosmology, Geology, and the Evolution of Life and Environment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1992 | location = UK | page = 228 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MfAGpVq8gpQC&pg=PA228 | isbn = 978-0-521-40949-0}}</ref><ref name=\"Manners\">{{cite book  | last = Manners | first = Joy | title = Static Fields and Potentials | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2000 | location = USA | page = 148 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vJyqbRPsXYQC&pg=PA148 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0718-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Hyperphysics\">{{cite web | last = Nave | first = Carl R. | title = Bar Magnet | work = Hyperphysics | publisher = Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State Univ.  | year = 2010 | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html | accessdate = 2011-04-10}}</ref>  \n\nThe positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Wallace A. |last1=Campbell |title=\"Magnetic\" pole locations on global charts are incorrect |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |volume=77 |issue=36 |page=345 |year=1996 |doi=10.1029/96EO00237 |bibcode=1996EOSTr..77..345C |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a7bc65d5bf4b4accd44f7ad6e787f1d4428e078 }}</ref> The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |title=The Magnetic North Pole |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819061122/http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |archive-date=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90\u00b0 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90\u00b0 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe.  Movements of up to {{convert|40|km}} per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [[Boothia Peninsula]] in 1831 to {{convert|600|km}} from [[Resolute Bay]] in 2001.<ref name=\"inconstant\" /> The ''magnetic equator'' is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\n\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant [[Multipole expansion|non-dipolar]] contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Magnetosphere ==\n[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|An artist's rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere. 1)&nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]\n{{main article|Magnetosphere}}\n\nEarth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's [[corona]] and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000&nbsp;kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF).<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\">{{harvnb|Merrill|2010}}, pages 126\u2013141</ref>\n\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [[magnetopause]], the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10&nbsp;[[Earth radius|Earth radii]] out but the other side stretching out in a [[magnetotail]] that extends beyond 200&nbsp;Earth radii.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\nSunward of the magnetopause is the [[bow shock]], the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nInside the magnetosphere is the [[plasmasphere]], a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This region begins at a height of 60&nbsp;km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" /> There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;million [[Electronvolt|electron volts]] (MeV)). The inner belt is 1\u20132&nbsp;Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4\u20137&nbsp;Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Darrouzet |first1=Fabien |last2=De Keyser |first2=Johan |last3=Escoubet |first3=C.

Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar System by the Sun's magnetosphere, or [[heliosphere]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Shields Up!

Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [[ring current]]. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /> Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also emit [[X-rays]].<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\n\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [[space weather]], are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [[geomagnetic storm]]s, can occur when a [[coronal mass ejection]] erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [[Halloween solar storms, 2003|the \"Halloween\" storm of 2003]] damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |title=The great solar superstorm of 1859 |journal=Technology Through Time |volume=70 |year=2010 |url=http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2010/TTT/70.php |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Time dependence ==\n\n===Short-term variations===\n[[File:Magnetic Storm Oct 2003.jpg|thumb|'''Background''': a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a [[magnetic storm]] in 2000.<br /> '''Globe''': map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in [[Micro-|\u03bc]] [[Tesla (unit)|T]].]]\n\nThe geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere ([[ionospheric dynamo region]]) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents.

If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nIn a perfect conductor (<math>\\sigma = \\infty\\;</math>), there would be no diffusion. By [[Lenz's law]], any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the ''frozen-in-field theorem''. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by [[convection]], motion driven by [[buoyancy]]. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called ''compositional convection''.

The function changes sign each \u2113time it crosses one of these lines.]]\n[[File:VFPt four charges.svg|thumb|Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together.]]\n\nThe most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of [[spherical harmonics]]. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.<ref name=Wallace2003>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003}}, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such ''[[nodal line]]s'' is the absolute value of the ''order'' {{math|<var>m</var>}}. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the ''degree'' \u2113. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A ''[[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]'' is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A ''[[Magnetic dipole|dipole]]'' is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a ''[[quadrupole]]'' to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.<ref name=MMMch2>{{harvnb |Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996 |loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nSpherical harmonics can represent any [[scalar field]] (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a [[vector field]], but if it is expressed in Cartesian components {{math|<var>X, Y, Z</var>}}, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the ''[[magnetic potential]]''. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  ''Gauss coefficient'' {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients \u2013 {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}}, and {{math|<var>h</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}} \u2013 determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Radial dependence====\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>\u2113+1</sup>}} and one that ''increases'' with radius as {{math|<var>r</var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source ({{math|\u2113{{=}}1}}) drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>2</sup>}}. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>3</sup>}}. Quadrupole terms drop off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>4</sup>}}, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree {{math|14}} or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about {{convert|2000|km}} or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Global models====\nThe [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] maintains a standard global field model called the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]]. It is updated every five years.

They claimed that Thomas had, for fear of kidnapping or assassination, been brought secretly to England on a ship captained by their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen (1725-1800), and adopted by him. Thomas was thus, they claimed, \u2018de jure monarch of England in place of the then reigning sovereign Queen Victoria\u2019.<ref>[[Sir Charles Petrie]], ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 189.</ref>\n\n\u2018They succeeded in fabricating around them an aura of bogus royalty which attracted the allegiance of a few romantic Jacobites in Victorian times\u2019.<ref>James Lees-Milne, ''The last Stuarts'' (1984) page 230.</ref> Herbert Vaughan called their story \u2018an impudent fabrication\u2019 and \u2018an unblushing fraud\u2019<ref>Herbert M. Vaughan, ''The last of the royal Stuarts: Henry Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York'' (1906) page 280</ref> but it was as Sir Charles Petrie wrote \u2018proof of the hold which the House of Stuart has never ceased to exercise upon popular imagination in the British Isles, so that ... if a man were to declare himself the heir to the Yorkist or Tudor dynasty, he would attract but little attention, yet if he claim to be a Stuart he will find hundreds ready to believe him\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 187.</ref>\n\nThe brothers\u2019 two publications, [[Vestiarium Scoticum]] (Edinburgh, 1842) and ''Costume of the Clans'' (Edinburgh, 1843), described by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper as \u2018shot through with pure fantasy and bare faced forgery\u2019,<ref>\u2018Invention of tradition; the Highland tradition of Scotland\u2019 in Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger, eds., ''The invention of tradition'' (University of Cambridge, 1983)</ref> have been sources widely used by the tartan industry in Scotland.\n==='''Family Background'''===\nThe brothers\u2019 grandfather, John Carter Allen (1725-1800), an admiral in the British navy, had three children: the above-named Lieutenant Thomas Allen (1767-1852), Jane or Jean Allen (c.1768-1829) who married Thomas Robinson, a widower, at [[Brighton]] in 1788, and Admiral John Allen (1771-1853). The three were named in John Carter Allen\u2019s will, though he bequeathed only \u00a3100 to Thomas and \u00a3100 and a pair of silver candlesticks to Jane, leaving \u00a32,200 and the residue to John. This disparity caused comment and some have speculated that Thomas was illegitimate, but an income had been guaranteed to him under his marriage settlement in 1792. \n\nHowever, additional research in 2014 showed that John Carter Allen did not marry until 1780 and that his three children were all illegitimate, born in a period in which he held no commission.<ref>John Charnock, ''Biographia Navalis'', vol. 6 (1798) 288.</ref> The three were named \u2018natural children of John Cator Allen\u2019 in the twelfth of sixteen codicils to the will of Elizabeth Arnold, his first wife\u2019s mother, dated in 1788 and proved in 1789. She left them twenty guineas each and \u00a31,000 to their father.<ref>Anthony Camp, New light on the Sobieski Stuarts, in ''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol. 31, no. 8 (December 2014) 298-306.</ref> The identity of their mother(s) has not been found. There was much tension in the family later and at one time the youngest son, John, was heard to say of Thomas, \u2018he is no brother of mine\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (1909) 102.</ref>\n\nJohn Carter Allen himself had been baptised at St Dunstan in the West in 1724/5, the son of Carter Allen (1700-1734), an attorney in the parish of St Clement Eastcheap in the [[City of London]], who had married Emma Hay or Hays at St Giles, Camberwell, in 1724. These details also were not known until 2014. Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, Bt]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick-upon Tweed|Berwick]], Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909).

They claimed that Thomas had, for fear of kidnapping or assassination, been brought secretly to England on a ship captained by their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen (1725-1800), and adopted by him. Thomas was thus, they claimed, \u2018de jure monarch of England in place of the then reigning sovereign Queen Victoria\u2019.<ref>[[Sir Charles Petrie]], ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 189.</ref>\n\n\u2018They succeeded in fabricating around them an aura of bogus royalty which attracted the allegiance of a few romantic Jacobites in Victorian times\u2019.<ref>James Lees-Milne, ''The last Stuarts'' (1984) page 230.</ref> Herbert Vaughan called their story \u2018an impudent fabrication\u2019 and \u2018an unblushing fraud\u2019<ref>Herbert M.

The three were named in John Carter Allen\u2019s will, though he bequeathed only \u00a3100 to Thomas and \u00a3100 and a pair of silver candlesticks to Jane, leaving \u00a32,200 and the residue to John. This disparity caused comment and some have speculated that Thomas was illegitimate, but an income had been guaranteed to him under his marriage settlement in 1792. \n\nHowever, additional research in 2014 showed that John Carter Allen did not marry until 1780 and that his three children were all illegitimate, born in a period in which he held no commission.<ref>John Charnock, ''Biographia Navalis'', vol. 6 (1798) 288.</ref> The three were named \u2018natural children of John Cator Allen\u2019 in the twelfth of sixteen codicils to the will of Elizabeth Arnold, his first wife\u2019s mother, dated in 1788 and proved in 1789. She left them twenty guineas each and \u00a31,000 to their father.<ref>Anthony Camp, New light on the Sobieski Stuarts, in ''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol. 31, no. 8 (December 2014) 298-306.</ref> The identity of their mother(s) has not been found. There was much tension in the family later and at one time the youngest son, John, was heard to say of Thomas, \u2018he is no brother of mine\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (1909) 102.</ref>\n\nJohn Carter Allen himself had been baptised at St Dunstan in the West in 1724/5, the son of Carter Allen (1700-1734), an attorney in the parish of St Clement Eastcheap in the [[City of London]], who had married Emma Hay or Hays at St Giles, Camberwell, in 1724. These details also were not known until 2014. Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, Bt]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick-upon Tweed|Berwick]], Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909). The book had previously been published as a series of articles in ''The Inverness Courier'', commencing in 1907. He concluded (page v) that \u2018nothing has been found of a sufficiently definite nature to support those claims. At the same time there is not sufficient evidence to damn them\u2019.\n \nC.L.

The cemetery is located on Las Delicias Avenue in the city of [[Maracaibo]], the capital of [[Zulia State]], west of the South American country of [[Venezuela]]. It is one of the oldest operating historical cemeteries in the country and Latin America overall, being officially established on [[November 12]] of [[1879]], but people were buried there as early as [[1821]]. The cemetery had many names since foundation, starting with no name, later in [[1925]] New Cemetery, New Square and The Square due to its particular form. Since September 2019 it holds the new current name The Square Luxburg-Carolath.\n\n== History ==\nIn the State of Zulia, as in all of Venezuela, there were different types of cemeteries, including local Indian burials pre-German foundation of the city. With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was a Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches in convents and attached lands they established. The Spanish Crown, in 1698, ordered to bury the deceased next to the parish churches. This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the regular cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church on El Transito street. The cemetery was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881). These cemeteries were looted for the theft of their marbles and other materials or eliminated to perform civil works in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased that were left were transferred to The Square, where Columbaries of 2 and 3 floors were made to accommodate them, they transferred them to The Square simply because it was the closest cemetery to transport the dead. \n \n[[File:Mapa_aereo_casco_central_Maracaibo_1940.png|thumbnail|aerial view in 1940 of the Luxburg-Catolath Square Cemetery]]\nThe foreign resident colony in Maracaibo, founded in 1824 and closed in 1942, what was known as the cemetery of English, Foreigners or Cementerio de Los Alemanes, (The name \u201cEnglish\u201d (ingleses)  name was actually at that time the same as Foreigners a synonym that today is also used as Gringos) the deceased of that cemetery were mostly English and German Protestants, also Jews because they did not have their cemetery and the Protestants got along with the Jews in Maracaibo and other places, there was no religious antipathy at that time between them, was a neighbor of the Colonial cemetery also on El Transit street, on the grounds of the current Panorama Newspaper (one of biggest in Venezuela). The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''

The cemetery is located on Las Delicias Avenue in the city of [[Maracaibo]], the capital of [[Zulia State]], west of the South American country of [[Venezuela]]. It is one of the oldest operating historical cemeteries in the country and Latin America overall, being officially established on [[November 12]] of [[1879]], but people were buried there as early as [[1821]]. The cemetery had many names since foundation, starting with no name, later in [[1925]] New Cemetery, New Square, The Square due to its particular form. Since September 2019 it holds the new current name The Square Luxburg-Carolath.\n\n== History ==\nIn the State of Zulia, as in all of Venezuela, there were different types of cemeteries and many cemeteries, including local Indian burials pre-German foundation of the city. With the arrival of the Spanish after the German foundation of Maracaibo coro and other important cities of the future Zulia State, it was Christian custom, to bury the deceased next to the churches, convents and attached lands they established. The Spanish Crown, in 1698, ordered to bury the deceased next to the parish churches. This law is changed by decree of the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], in the year 1827, forcing the dead to be buried in special lands destined for such purposes. Thus began the specialized cemeteries separated from the Churches and city centers. Following these rules, the General Cemetery of Maracaibo, or \u201cOld Cemetery\u201d, was created in 1821, on land located behind the San Juan de Dios church, on El Transito street, which was closed in 1880. Original cemeteries existed three cemeteries' main ancient The Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was inaugurated in 1821, the Cemetery of the Germans (1824) and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia (1881). These cemeteries were looted for the theft of their marbles and other materials or eliminated to perform civil works in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased that were left were transferred to The Square, where Columbaries of 2 and 3 floors were made to accommodate them, they transferred them to The Square simply because it was the closest cemetery to transport the dead. \n \n[[File:Mapa_aereo_casco_central_Maracaibo_1940.png|thumbnail|aerial view in 1940 of the Luxburg-Catolath Square Cemetery]]\nThe foreign resident colony in Maracaibo, founded in 1824 and closed in 1942, what was known as the cemetery of English, Foreigners or Cementerio de Los Alemanes, (The name \u201cEnglish\u201d (ingleses)  name was actually at that time the same as Foreigners a synonym that today is also used as Gringos) the deceased of that cemetery were mostly English and German Protestants, also Jews because they did not have their cemetery and the Protestants got along with the Jews in Maracaibo and other places, there was no religious antipathy at that time between them, was a neighbor of the Colonial cemetery also on El Transit street, on the grounds of the current Panorama Newspaper (one of biggest in Venezuela). The cemetery of foreigners was also actually the main cement maker of all Protestant Christians in Maracaibo, not only Protestant Germans, but Protestant Englishmen and many other different European nationalities and beliefs were buried there. For the simple reason that at that time there was some \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d of these religions of the great majority of Venezuelans who were devout Catholics to the Christianity of the Roman Catholic Church. We cannot say that there was religious persecution in Venezuela, but if a certain antipathy based on misunderstanding or simply little culture of the population. Maracaibo is a unique city in South America, it was founded by Germans, Ambrosio Alfinger on 8 September 1528. That date is today considered and officially celebrated as the day of the foundation of the city. After the independence of Venezuela, trade between Europe and mainly North Germany, Great Britain, France to Venezuela increased, mainly influenced by the favorable support of Germany France and Britain to Venezuelan independence war, many Germans and British participated militarily as officers and soldiers in the war of independence for Venezuela. Product of this fact an infinity of these and others that were progressively reaching Venezuela, Maracaibo and the port of La Guaira.\n[[File:Cementerio ingleses.png|thumbnail|English Cemetery see box]]\n[[File:Cementerio ingles paredes.png|thumbnail|Adjacencies of the Old English Cemetery]]\nMaracaibo was the largest city in Venezuela in the north and Venezuela's \"continental\" guide. The first deep port of South America in the Atlantic Ocean. Citizens of many European countries began arriving in Venezuela. as well as from the United States of America, being mostly practitioners of religions and cults different from the main Venezuelan religion the Roman Catholic Church. We have to understand that there were also many Masons among all these people - who joined each other without differentiating race or nationality religion. At that time there was a lot of rivalry and negativity from the Venezuelan Catholic clergy to other religions or branches of Christianity.\n\nFor example, In Guaira, the English Consul Sir Robert Kerr Porter, and C.D. Strohm, M. Wolff, Otto Winckelmann, H. Stall, C.C. Nolting, and R. Roosen Runge founded the Aliens Cemetery Society in La Guaira. Mr. Robert Syers sold them land between the Guanapa River and Punta de Mulato, and that was part of his stay in Guanapa.\n\nThe Square (El Cuadrado), officially founded on November 12, 1879, because it was baptized that date, founded it was some years before, built by private shareholders like many of the cemeteries in Venezuela, and so it is today, known as The Square(El Cuadrado), for having the perfect shape of a fairly proportional quadrilateral 200 x 200 meters. Hermes Romero made its architectural design. Here is a certain format for discussion, because we know that on November 12, 1879, it was actually baptized as a cemetery and the foundation was several years before. At first, the cemetery was simply called the New Cemetery because it was the newest in the city at that time, the Marabinos actually named it The Square which was officially registered in 1925 by the Troconis family in the official name. The Square lost its shape, almost perfect square, at the time of President Rafael Caldera during the reconstruction of Maracaibo of its tracks - in part on its land two apartment buildings were built. The foundation of El Cuadrado coincided with the attack of the yellow fever epidemic on Maracaibo. The Square for the year 1900, is the urban limit of the city of Maracaibo. Many are the works of sculptural and historical value, there lie many of the Zulian characters of Independence and prominent Zulians, from other times. Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada, Ismael Urdaneta, Francisco Ochoa, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo, the Belloso family, Rinc\u00f3n, Osorio, Cook, Arria, Von Jess, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borjas Romero, Juice, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Y\u00e9pez, Manuel Dagnino, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Urquinaona, Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n, Guillermo Quintero Luzardo, Eduardo Mathias Losada, Julio \u00c1rraga, Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez, families, as some of the best-known men and families in Venezuela and Latin America. In addition to El Cuadrado, another of the old cemeteries, now disappeared, was the cemetery of Santa Lucia, opened on January 30, 1881, and also closed in 1942. And it is not a new claim, the Panorama newspaper in its edition of January 7 In 2006, he published a report where the journalist Pa\u00fal Ram\u00edrez Mora said that 40 antisocials were living there and that more than 96,000 souls rested on 800 square meters in El Cuadrado. The Luxburg-Carolath Square cemetery is made up of four cemeteries, which are the colonial cemetery, the English cemetery, the Saint Lucia cemetery and The Square Luxburg-Carolath itself. Which makes it unique in Venezuela and Latin America.\n\nThe cemetery The Square Luxburg-Carolath, when it was built, was 200 x 200 meters. It was built in a classic style (classicism), due to the influence of the European colony in Maracaibo. The cemetery is the most famous, and oldest operational cemetery in Zulia and Venezuela, the most historical, not only because of its architecture but also because of the vast majority of the personalities that formed the splendor Maracaibo, Zulia and Venezuela that rest in peace there. Fine marble monuments brought from Italy each piece with spectacular details. Unique exquisite works composed of all known Architectural styles. The terrible \u201cSpanish flu\u201d or \u201cel trancazo\u201d, which in 1918 ended, according to data from the time with 800-1000 maracaiberos (citizens of Maracaibo), which represented in a population of about 36,000 souls, a mortality rate, from the flu, near 3%, similar to the world death rate. This was that of every 100 marabinos 50 were sick and about 3 died from the flu. It is understood because it prevented the procession of the Virgen de la Chiquinquir\u00e1 from leaving the old Saladillo neighborhood miraculously. \"Many souls received The Square in that epidemic.\" Actually, El Cuadrado is not just a historical treasure of Zulia or Maracaibo because of its architecture, it is mainly the only historical cemetery that houses 3 cemeteries in it and all possible major world religions. Catholics, Jews, Protestants and who knows who else. It is something unique in Venezuela.\n\nThe cemetery has about 1000 tombs which hold 10,364 dead people among whose graves, niches and pantheons have been buried in Zulian illustrious as the hero of independence Antonio Pulgar; the immortal rector of University of Zulia, Jes\u00fas Enrique Losada; the poet Ud\u00f3n P\u00e9rez; the doctor and scientist Humberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mor\u00e1n; the precursor of the national cinema Manuel Trujillo Dur\u00e1n; the artist Julio \u00c1rraga; Dr. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Portillo; the creator of the university city, Antonio Borjas Romero; the magnate of the missing Bella Vista Castle, Lucas Evangelista Rinc\u00f3n; Don Manuel Belloso, founder of Cobeca and the \"saint\" Fray Junipero, whose body is said to remain intact in his coffin and becomes incredibly heavy if they try to move it. Isaiah chapter 14, verse 19 states: \"But you have been cast out of your sepulcher as a rejected rod.\" Today in the cemeteries, no grave enjoys privacy; the holy rest is interrupted amorally. Nowadays many times life is not respected and less death.\n\n== Description ==\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer counts that they have desecrated the great majority of the graves. \u201cThere is a depraved crime. There is no moral, nor respect for the deceased, for values, \u201dhe lamented. The buried body of a person takes 8 years to exhume and transfer the remains to the ossuary and the criminals opt for those that are more than 100 years old, that is, from 1920 onwards. Most are shattered. \u201cThe graves have very large marble vases, and they grab it to break the ossuaries. Mr. Ferrer estimated that of the 10 thousand three hundred people buried in El Cuadrado, and about 15 thousand dead in a unique separate vault called \u201cEl Carnero\u201d which is 50 meter deep, of which 40-50% is already abandoned, since \u201cthey have been lost because they are very old, or because relatives left them abandoned \"\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer, current worker of the El Cuadrado cemetery, his family has a long history related to the cemetery since the first worker Heriberto Hern\u00e1ndez for 45 years of service. He was the grandfather's father-in-law, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ferrer, of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer. Then came the grandfather who was 72 years in total. When the grandfather dies, Pope Nilo Enrique Ferrer Hern\u00e1ndez comes with 52 years of service, who died in 2011 and since that year Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer is the queeping with the tradition.\n\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer supervised and organized all the works in the cemetery by the Foundation Luxburg-Carolath to the cemetery. He was, with all his coworkers, the most important human factor in the entire organization since day one of all works. He and the history of his family related to all the time that the cemetery exists since its foundation is a separate story of Marabinos dedicated to their work of a family dynasty.\n\nSeveral tombs in the square have bars on top built by relatives who thought that would save them from thief and tomb raiders. They didn't help much. The bars were forced the desecrated tombs - the undergrowth emptied and they went into oblivion until the general cleaning. A common Venezuelan construction in our cemeteries that in our opinion have very few analogs in the world. By restoring cemeteries and putting all souls to rest in peace, we have in our opinion to leave as a memory to the time of tomb raiders and complete desolation. It didn't work, all the graves were perpetrated and stolen without any difference. Many activists and hired people worked during this work that seems simple at first but it was a difficult task because it is not a simple work yard it is a cemetery.\n\n== Characteristic of The Square Luxburg-Carolath Cemetery ==\nIn Maracaibo, the Colonial Cemetery (Old Cemetery or General Cemetery of Maracaibo) was opened in 1829, the Cemetery of the Germans opened 1834 and the Cemetery of Saint Lucia opened 1881. These cemeteries were sawn to perform civil works in the city in the year of 1942. The remains of the deceased who were left were transferred to the El Cuadrado cemetery simply because they were the closest to them. Columbariums were built in El Cuadrado to accommodate the deceased of the cemeteries. That is why the square cemetery is unique in Venezuela, it houses 3 other cemeteries since 1829, forming only one on 4, there are four cemeteries together in one. Like the city of Maracaibo. It is also called Athens of Latin America, the city of the 3 foundations. It is the most famous and ancient in Maracaibo and Zulia. The Columbariums today are in a total state of looting, deterioration, and perpetration. The reconstruction project of the cemetery carries the historical inclusion of the 3 cemeteries and their families.\n\n== Mixed Unique Architecture ==\nThe Square (El Cuadrado) is considered as an outstanding work of Funeral and Religious Art. The one that shows how Maracaibo el Zulia and Venezuela lived and developed. It is common to say that countries/governments and their level of civilization are judged by how they treat their deceased and their jailed citizens. The development of cemeteries the style of their graves is a unique contribution to the entity of any community in the world. It has almost all styles of architecture made such as Neoclassical, Classic, Naco (vulgar), Humble, Eclecticism, Gothic, Contemporary, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, with endless variations of their own given by family members. One of the few examples of different styles of architecture: Art Nouveau is represented by Fernandez Moran, Coronell Francisco Aguirre. Pantheon Electrico family Quintero designed by Hermes Romero (the same architect that designed The Square) Tomb of the Losada family inspired by the temple of classical antiquity and others that will be described separately. All known styles in one way or another are presented in the cemetery.\n\n== Owner and Administration ==\n'''The Grafen von Luxburg Family Foundation, F\u00fcrsten zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinzen von Schoenaich-Carolath''' is a civil, charitable and non-profit foundation founded on June 14, 1940, by [[Karl von Luxburg]]; She is the owner and administrator of the Cemetery Luxburg-Carolath Square since August 2019.\n\n'''Karl Ludwig Graf von Luxburg, F\u00fcrst zu Carolath-Beuthen und Prinz von Schoenaich-Carolath, Minister and Ambassador of the German Empire during World War I.'''
