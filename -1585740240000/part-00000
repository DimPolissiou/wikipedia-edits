Bharti's father the rich, Rupesh Chauhan ([[Shailesh Datar]]) finally finds a suitable match in the poor Murli Laal ([[Vikrant Massey]]), who saves Bharti whilst she is being thrown into the air by a crowd of men at the wedding of Neelam, a friend of Bharti's. After seeing that, Bharti's father is impressed by Murli he saves Bharti and gets into a massive fight with the men. Bharti's father decides to send a proposal to Bhansi Laal, Murli's father to accept Bharti for their son Murli. So then one day Rupesh Chauhan went to Murli's house to invite them to his house just for something then as he got them to come Rupesh Chauhan then blurts out that he wants to get Bharti married to Murli and be their youngest daughter in law on hearing that everyone gets shocked in the Laal family especially Murli, who is infuriated and runs back home and refuses to marry Bharti and Rupesh is once again disappointed. Then family problems occur that Murli comes to know he is everyone's half brother and Murli's younger sister Veena needs to get married but they are low on money which makes Gaushala who is Murli's sister-in-law forces Murli to marry Bharti and with all the chaos Murli decides to marry Bharti for his sister's wedding. But after the wedding the turmoil increases for Murli and Bharti with Veena about to marry Mirdang's friend Prakash and Bharti realises that Prakash isn't the right man for Veena so on the wedding Bharti breaks the wedding the whole Laal family hate her and after all the problems and fights Bharti asks Murli for a divorce and then Bharti and Murli are now divorced. After the divorce Gaushala and Mirdang plan to get a new bride for Murli so they invite Jhumka who is Gaushala's younger sister. Mirdang and Gaushala tells Jhumka to flirt with Murli to grab his attention, but this only makes Murli even angrier, rather than amorous. Gaushala's plan fails when their trick works on Dumroo because on the first day of Jhumka's appearance Dumroo was smitten by her so then Jhumka and Dumroo eventually fall in love. As we know Murli is divorced and finds a job in a business owned by Ramaftar, who is a very dangerous and abusive to people especially his wife named Sudha. Murli comes about to know about Ramaftar's true actions when he sees people taking Sudha to the hospital after the brutal attack by Ramaftar. There he follows the people and meets Sudha who begs him to take her home with him for a few days Murli agrees and takes her home.\n\nThen back at Murli's house there's another awaits when Murli brings Sudha home and everyone argues about Sudha staying here and then the family eventually agree about the placement of Sudha. Meanwhile at Bharti's house, after the divorce, Bharti is still determined to get the truth of Prakash out to Murli's family so with the help of her friend Amit who used to be Prakash's friend and her family they track down Prakash. At the Laal family more and more chaos comes when Ramaftar comes to know about Murli taking Sudha home and he tries to hurt Murli, but Sudha enters and slaps him and defeats him and then breaks all the relationship with him so he leaves.\n\nAnother thing awaits when it revealed that Sudha is Bharti's school friend and Bharti knew about Ramaftar and she also knows about the person that took her home with but little does she know it's her husband Murli so when Sudha tells Bharti meet her hero but Bharti never gets to meet until on holi when Bharti sees Murli saving Sudha from Ramaftar yet again then she comes home and cries because she thinks that Murli and Sudha are a couple. But Sudha finds out that Murli was married to Bharti but got divorced in some circumstances when Dumroo introduces Sudha to Bharti and Murli's marriage. To clear all the misunderstandings Sudha asks Bharti to explain to Murli that they are not a couple.\n\nAfter a few days Prakash's truth come towards Murli's family and Mirdang, Murli and Dumroo fight with Prakash and the whole family feel bad about mistreating Bharti and they go and apologise to her and the misunderstandings are clear with the two families.\n\nBut another chaos happens when Prakash kidnapped Bharti and Amit and threatens Murli and Rupesh Ji to give money and then after a lot of searches the two families find Prakash and they get him arrested and Murli and Bharti hug and reunite. This does stop their when Prakash gets the gun from the police and tries to shoot Murli but to save Murli Rupesh Ji intervenes to save Murli and is himself shot everyone is shocked and worried so they take him to the hospital where Rupesh Ji takes his last breaths with Bharti and Murli and the whole family then he dies.\n\nAfter the death of Rupesh Ji, Murli has to take in charge of Bharti and Dhara and then Murli realises that he has fell in love with Bharti and he announces that he wants to marry Bharti but Bharti is unsure and is fearing about what happened the last time they were married. Eventually Bharti and everyone else agree that Murli and Bharti's wedding was wonderful and Murli and Bharti were meant for each other.\n\nMeanwhile Sudha, who secretly loves Murli, is a bit heartbroken but is happy for Bharti and decides to go to her brother\"s house. Bharti discovers Sudha's feelings for Murli and talks to her about it and Sudha says that Murli is only hers and to stay happy and she then leaves and in tears, but Bharti is unaware.            \n\nAfter the whole wedding motion Bharti and Murli enjoy their nuptial night together then it's the next day and it's the first day to make something for family and prepares it with a help of Murli and then takes it to the family and the whole enjoy the meal after everyone notices Sudha is not present and as we know and only Bharti knows Sudha had disappeared for good.            \n\nAs the families' problems have been resolved, Jhumka and Dumroo's love story is to be completed, so Gaushala invites some singers to pray from and then when Bhansi sees the prayer he comes to know it's his younger brother Murari and his son Kartik and daughter-in-law Ashtumi and gets happy with seeing them and the whole family they get very angry and upset especially Murli, because his uncle Murari a childhood enemy of his father and had to break ties with him and know reunite and decide to let them stay in their bungalow.\n\n==Cast==\n*Juhi Aslam as Bharti Chauhan / Laal <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/My-height-is-my-biggest-strength-Juhi-Aslam/articleshow/6599975.cms|title=My height is my biggest strength - Juhi Aslam|website=timesofindia.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/Iamprsquom- excited-about-playing-a-mother-in-law-Juhi-Aslam/articleshow/11144342.cms|title=I am excited about playing a mother in law - Juhi Aslam|website=timesofindia.com}}</ref>\n*[[Vikrant Massey]] as Murli Laal (Mirdang and Dumroo's youngest brother and Veena's older brother and Bhansi Laal and Kamal Laal's youngest son)\n*[[Shailesh Datar]] as Rupesh Chauhan (Bharati's father)\n*Madhavi Gogate as Dhara Chauhan (Bharati's mother)\n*Darpan Srivastava as Murari laal - Murli's uncle\n*Meenakshi Sethi as Chimti aka Chimti Naani - mother of Gaushala and Jhumka\n*[[Darshan Kumar]] as Mridang Laal\n*[[Ashita Dhawan]] as Gaushala Mridang Laal\n*Rahul Trivedi as Dumroo Laal (the eldest brother of Mirdang and Murli and Veena)\n*[[Tanvi Thakkar]] as Jhumka Dumroo Laal - Dumroo's wife\n*Shailesh Gulabani as Karthik - Murli's cousin brother\n*[[Reshmi Ghosh]] as Ashthami - Karthik's wife and Murli's cousin sister-in-law\n*[[Priya Bathija]] as Sudha - cameo\n*Nupur Alankaar as Manju - mother of Pari and Kopal\n*[[Tabrez Khan]] as Vihaan Laal - Murli and Bharti's eldest son\n*Raj Singh as Aditya laal - Murli and Bharti's youngest son\n*[[Aditi Tailang]] as Kopal Vihaan Laal (Bharti and Murli's eldest daughter-in-law).\n*Shalini Sahuta as Pari Aditya Laal (Bharti and Murli's youngest daughter-in-law).\n*Anmol Singh as Rimjim Laal - daughter of Jumka and Dumroo Laal\n*Kanika Kotnala as Jasmine Laal (daughter of Mirdang and Gaushala).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Imagine Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Imagine TV television series]]\n[[Category:2010 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 Indian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television series]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox Television\n| show_name            = Baba Aiso Varr Dhoondo\n| image                = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = [[Drama]]\n| picture_format       = [[576i]] \n| runtime              = 24 minutes\n| creator              = Raakesh Paswan\n| creative_director    = \n| writer               = Raakesh Paswan <br> Vandana Tiwari <br> Manoj Tripathi <br> Shilpa Choube <br> Susheel Choube <br> Mamta Kashyap <br> Raghuvir Shekhawat <br> Nikhilesh Sharma\n| director             = Ismail Umarr Khan \n| producer             = Saurabh Tewari <br> Abhinav Shukla \n| opentheme            = \n| camera               = [[Multi-camera]]\n| company              = Nautanki Films\n| country              = [[India]]\n| language             = [[Hindi]]\n| channel              = [[Imagine TV]]\n| num_episodes         = 399\n| first_aired          = {{start date|df=y|2010|9|20}}\n| last_aired           ={{end date|df=y|2012|4|12}} \n| website              = \n}}\n\n'''''Baba Aiso Varr Dhoondo''''' is an Indian television series that aired on [[Imagine TV]] from 20 September 2010 to 12 April 2012.

It was not the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|first space telescope]] but it is one of the largest and most versatile, well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy.

Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as [[Hubble's law#Using Hubble space telescope data|determining the rate of expansion of the universe]].\n\nThe Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency [[NASA]] with contributions from the [[European Space Agency]]. The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] controls the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/ |title=Hubble Essentials |website=Hubblesite.org |access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. It was finally launched by {{OV|Discovery}} in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in [[spherical aberration]] that compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a [[STS-61|servicing mission]] in 1993.\n\nHubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] (2003), but NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] approved the [[STS-125|fifth servicing mission]] which was completed in 2009.

First, the [[angular resolution]] (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction]], rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as [[astronomical seeing|seeing]]. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05&nbsp;arcsec for a telescope with a [[mirror]] {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observe [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] light, which are strongly absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].\n\nSpitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] recommended development of a [[space telescope]] as part of the [[Human spaceflight|space program]], and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |title=About Lyman Spitzer, Jr |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327091202/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following [[World War II|World War{{nbsp}}II]], as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in [[rocket]] technology.

It was followed by [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2|OAO-2]], which carried out ultraviolet observations of [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |title=OAO |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916121848/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |archivedate=September 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based [[reflecting telescope]] with a mirror {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable [[Space Shuttle]] indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=32}}\n\n=== Quest for funding ===\nThe continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, [[public spending]] cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nIn response a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met [[United States House of Representatives|congressmen]] and [[United States Senate|senators]] in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to half the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=34}}\n\nThe funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3&nbsp;m to 2.4&nbsp;m, both to cut costs<ref name=\"gander\">{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Geoff |title=The telescope: its history, technology, and future |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12979-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/telescopeitshist00ande/page/116 116] |url=https://archive.org/details/telescopeitshist00ande/page/116 }}</ref> and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the [[European Space Agency]].

The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an [[accuracy]] of about a tenth of the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]], but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be [[diffraction-limited system|diffraction limited]] to take full advantage of the space environment.

Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] due to elevated [[radiation]] levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50\u00b0, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90\u00b0 to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not [[occultation|occulted]] for long periods. Due to the [[precession]] of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks.

However, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant nearly all the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=375}} NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a [[white elephant]]. For instance, in the 1991 comedy ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]]'', in a scene where high-profile disasters were displayed, Hubble was pictured with ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'', and the [[Edsel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102510/ |title=The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodwin, Irwin |date=1994 |title=Hubble repair improves vision and helps restore NASA's image |journal=Physics Today |volume=47 |issue=3 |page=42 |author2=Cioffi, Denis F. |doi=10.1063/1.2808434 |bibcode=1994PhT....47c..42G}}</ref> The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated [[image processing]] techniques such as [[deconvolution]].{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=514\u2013515}}\n\n=== Origin of the problem ===\n[[File:PIA22913-HubbleSpaceTelescope-ComparisonOfCameraImages-20181204.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Optical evolution of Hubble's primary camera system.

The Allen Commission found that a reflective [[null corrector]], a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled\u2014one lens was out of position by {{convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=7-1|ps=: The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.}} During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, [[Perkin-Elmer]] analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step ([[figuring]]), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. A few final tests, using the conventional null correctors, correctly reported [[spherical aberration]]. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=512|ps=: \"the firm's optical operations personnel dismissed the evidence as itself flawed. They believed the other two null correctors were less accurate than the reflective null corrector and so could not verify its reliability. Since they assumed the perfection of the mirror and reflective null corrector, they rejected falsifying information from independent tests, believed no problems existed, and reported only good news.\"}}\n\nThe commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=10-1}}\n\n=== Design of a solution ===\nThe design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as \"[[Glasses|spectacles]]\" to correct the spherical aberration.<ref>Chaisson, Eric (1994).

Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no [[citation]]s, while only two percent of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.stsci.edu/%7Ewebdocs/STScINewsletter/2003/spring_03.pdf |title=Hubble Science Metrics |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |first1=Georges |last1=Meylan |first2=Juan |last2=Madrid |first3=Duccio |last3=Macchetto |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2003}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} ground-based telescope such as the [[William Herschel Telescope]], the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benn, CR |author2=S\u00e1nchez, SF |date=2001 |title=Scientific Impact of Large Telescopes |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=113 |issue=781 |pages=385\u2013396 |doi=10.1086/319325 |bibcode=2001PASP..113..385B |arxiv=astro-ph/0010304}}</ref>\n\nDeciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such as [[aperture masking interferometry]] had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 10<sup>8</sup> times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1987Natur.328..694H |author=Haniff, CA |display-authors=4 |author2=Mackay, CD |author3=Titterington, DJ |author4=Sivia, D |author5=Baldwin, JE |title=The first images from optical aperture synthesis |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=328 |date=August 1987 |issue=6132 |pages=694\u2013696 |doi=10.1038/328694a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1990MNRAS.245P...7B |author=Buscher, DF |author2=Baldwin, JE |author3=Warner, PJ |author4=Haniff, CA |title=Detection of a bright feature on the surface of Betelgeuse |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=245 |date=July 1990 |page=7}}</ref> Since then, advances in [[adaptive optics]] have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can correct only a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.\n\n=== Impact on aerospace engineering ===\nIn addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions to [[aerospace engineering]], in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite composite]] structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, [[radiation damage]] to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of [[multi-layer insulation]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Experience with the Hubble Space Telescope: 20 years of an archetype |journal=Optical Engineering |first=Matthew D. |last=Lallo |volume=51 |issue=1 |at=011011 |date=January 2012 |doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.1.011011 |bibcode=2012OptEn..51a1011L |arxiv=1203.0002}}</ref> One lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion.

STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=67\u201369}}\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nHubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made [[Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System]] (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data.

The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/aug/HQ_05242_hst_2_gyros.html |title=Hubble Space Telescope Begins 'Two-Gyro' Science Operations |publisher=NASA |first1=Dolores |last1=Beasley |first2=Susan |last2=Hendrix |first3=Donna |last3=Weaver |date=August 31, 2005 |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> One more gyroscope failed in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12600-hubble-telescope-loses-another-gyroscope-.html |title=Hubble telescope loses another gyroscope |work=New Scientist |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyroscopes were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three were still working.

NASA later reported that the cause of the safe mode within the instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range. On January 15, 2019, NASA said the cause of the failure was a software problem. Engineering data within the telemetry circuits were not accurate. In addition, all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue. After resetting the telemetry circuits and associated boards the instrument began functioning again. On January 17, 2019, the device was returned to normal operation and on the same day it completed its first science observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/wide-field-camera-3-anomaly-on-hubble-space-telescope|title=Hubble's Wide Field Camera{{nbsp}}3 Recovered, Collecting Science Data|last=Gutro|first=Rob|date=January 17, 2019|publisher=NASA}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/space-observatories/hubbles-wide-field-camera-3-resumes-operations/|title=Hubble's Wide Field Camera{{nbsp}}3 resumes operations|last=Kornfeld|first=Laurel|date=January 17, 2019|work=Spaceflight Insider}}</ref>\n\n== Future ==\n=== Orbital decay and controlled reentry ===\n[[File:Soft Capture Mechanism installed on Hubble (illustration).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM) installed on Hubble]]\n\nHubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and over time its orbit [[orbital decay|decays]] due to [[drag (physics)|drag]].

These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using [[adaptive optics]] (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.\n\nPlans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble.<ref name=\"SAOverview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=hubble-servicing-mission-shuttle |title=Last Dance with the Shuttle: What's in Store for the Final Hubble Servicing Mission |first=John |last=Matson |date=May 8, 2009 |work=Scientific American |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 [[Lagrangian point]], where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened.

See discussions on talk page and its archives about omission of these details. --> and remains in operation. It was not the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory|first space telescope]] but it is one of the largest and most versatile, well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] and is one of NASA's [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]], along with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], and the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_NASA_Great_Observatories_PS.html |title=NASA's Great Observatories |publisher=NASA |last=Canright |first=Shelley |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nHubble features a {{convert|2.4|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} mirror, and its four main instruments observe in the [[ultraviolet]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], and [[near infrared]] regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in [[astrophysics]], such as [[Hubble's law#Using Hubble space telescope data|determining the rate of expansion of the universe]].\n\nThe Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency [[NASA]] with contributions from the [[European Space Agency]]. The [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] controls the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/ |title=Hubble Essentials |website=Hubblesite.org |access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. It was finally launched by {{OV|Discovery}} in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in [[spherical aberration]] that compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a [[STS-61|servicing mission]] in 1993.\n\nHubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]] (2003), but NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] approved the [[STS-125|fifth servicing mission]] which was completed in 2009. The telescope is operating {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, and could last until 2030\u20132040.<ref name=\"cbsnews20130530\"/> Its successor is the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) which is scheduled to be launched in March 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-completes-webb-telescope-review-commits-to-launch-in-early-2021 |title=NASA Completes Webb Telescope Review, Commits to Launch in Early 2021 |website=[[NASA]] |date=June 27, 2018 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Conception, design and aim ==\n=== Proposals and precursors ===\n[[File:Astronaut Owen Garriott Performs EVA During Skylab 3 - GPN-2002-000065.jpg|thumb|Astronaut [[Owen Garriott]] working next to Skylab's crewed solar space observatory, 1973]]\n\nIn 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]]\u2014considered a father of modern rocketry, along with [[Robert H.

Oldenbourg-Verlay |page=85 |date=1923}}</ref>\n\nThe history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, to the [[astronomer]] [[Lyman Spitzer]]'s paper \"Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory\".<ref>Spitzer, Lyman Jr., \"Report to Project Rand: Astronomical Advantages of an Extra-Terrestrial Observatory\", reprinted in [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol5/ExploreUnknown.pdf ''NASA SP-2001-4407: Exploring the Unknown''], Chapter 3, Document III-1, p. 546.</ref> In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, the [[angular resolution]] (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction]], rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as [[astronomical seeing|seeing]]. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05&nbsp;arcsec for a telescope with a [[mirror]] {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observe [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] light, which are strongly absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].\n\nSpitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] recommended development of a [[space telescope]] as part of the [[Human spaceflight|space program]], and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |title=About Lyman Spitzer, Jr |publisher=Caltech |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327091202/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/about/spitzer.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following [[World War II|World War{{nbsp}}II]], as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in [[rocket]] technology.

OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2|OAO-2]], which carried out ultraviolet observations of [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |title=OAO |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916121848/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/oao |archivedate=September 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based [[reflecting telescope]] with a mirror {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable [[Space Shuttle]] indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=32}}\n\n=== Quest for funding ===\nThe continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, [[public spending]] cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nIn response a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met [[United States House of Representatives|congressmen]] and [[United States Senate|senators]] in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to half the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=34}}\n\nThe funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3&nbsp;m to 2.4&nbsp;m, both to cut costs<ref name=\"gander\">{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Geoff |title=The telescope: its history, technology, and future |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12979-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/telescopeitshist00ande/page/116 116] |url=https://archive.org/details/telescopeitshist00ande/page/116 }}</ref> and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the [[European Space Agency]]. ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as the [[solar cell]]s that would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope.<ref>\"Memorandum of Understanding Between The European Space Agency and The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration\", reprinted in [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol5/ExploreUnknown.pdf ''NASA SP-2001-4407: Exploring the Unknown''], Chapter 3, Document III-29, p. 671.</ref> Congress eventually approved funding of {{US$|36 million}} for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983.{{sfn|Spitzer|1979|p=34}} In 1983 the telescope was named after [[Edwin Hubble]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/hubble/chron.html |last=Okolski |first=Gabriel |title=A Chronology of the Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}</ref> who confirmed one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century made by [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] that the [[universe]] is [[expanding universe|expanding]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hubble.nasa.gov/overview/conception-part1.php |title=The Path to Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524211736/http://hubble.nasa.gov/overview/conception-part1.php |archivedate=May 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction and engineering ===\n[[File:Hubble mirror polishing.jpg|thumb|Grinding of Hubble's primary mirror at Perkin-Elmer, March 1979]]\n\nOnce the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=487\u2013488}} MSFC commissioned the optics company [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]] to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=489}}\n\n=== Optical Telescope Assembly ===\nOptically, the HST is a [[Cassegrain reflector]] of [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien design]], as are most large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an [[accuracy]] of about a tenth of the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]], but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be [[diffraction-limited system|diffraction limited]] to take full advantage of the space environment.

Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] due to elevated [[radiation]] levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50\u00b0, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90\u00b0 to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not [[occultation|occulted]] for long periods. Due to the [[precession]] of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks.

However, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant nearly all the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects.{{sfn|Tatarewicz|1998|p=375}} NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a [[white elephant]]. For instance, in the 1991 comedy ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]]'', in a scene where high-profile disasters were displayed, Hubble was pictured with ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'', the ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'', and the [[Edsel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102510/ |title=The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodwin, Irwin |date=1994 |title=Hubble repair improves vision and helps restore NASA's image |journal=Physics Today |volume=47 |issue=3 |page=42 |author2=Cioffi, Denis F. |doi=10.1063/1.2808434 |bibcode=1994PhT....47c..42G}}</ref> The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated [[image processing]] techniques such as [[deconvolution]].{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|pp=514\u2013515}}\n\n=== Origin of the problem ===\n[[File:PIA22913-HubbleSpaceTelescope-ComparisonOfCameraImages-20181204.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Optical evolution of Hubble's primary camera system.

The Allen Commission found that a reflective [[null corrector]], a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled\u2014one lens was out of position by {{convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=7-1|ps=: The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.}} During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, [[Perkin-Elmer]] analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step ([[figuring]]), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. A few final tests, using the conventional null correctors, correctly reported [[spherical aberration]]. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.{{sfn|Dunar|Waring|1999|p=512|ps=: \"the firm's optical operations personnel dismissed the evidence as itself flawed. They believed the other two null correctors were less accurate than the reflective null corrector and so could not verify its reliability. Since they assumed the perfection of the mirror and reflective null corrector, they rejected falsifying information from independent tests, believed no problems existed, and reported only good news.\"}}\n\nThe commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.{{sfn|Allen|Angel|Mangus|Rodney|1990|p=10-1}}\n\n=== Design of a solution ===\nThe design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as \"[[Glasses|spectacles]]\" to correct the spherical aberration.<ref>Chaisson, Eric (1994).

Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no [[citation]]s, while only two percent of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.stsci.edu/%7Ewebdocs/STScINewsletter/2003/spring_03.pdf |title=Hubble Science Metrics |journal=Newsletter |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |first1=Georges |last1=Meylan |first2=Juan |last2=Madrid |first3=Duccio |last3=Macchetto |volume=20 |issue=2 |date=Spring 2003}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} ground-based telescope such as the [[William Herschel Telescope]], the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Benn, CR |author2=S\u00e1nchez, SF |date=2001 |title=Scientific Impact of Large Telescopes |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=113 |issue=781 |pages=385\u2013396 |doi=10.1086/319325 |bibcode=2001PASP..113..385B |arxiv=astro-ph/0010304}}</ref>\n\nDeciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such as [[aperture masking interferometry]] had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 10<sup>8</sup> times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1987Natur.328..694H |author=Haniff, CA |display-authors=4 |author2=Mackay, CD |author3=Titterington, DJ |author4=Sivia, D |author5=Baldwin, JE |title=The first images from optical aperture synthesis |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=328 |date=August 1987 |issue=6132 |pages=694\u2013696 |doi=10.1038/328694a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1990MNRAS.245P...7B |author=Buscher, DF |author2=Baldwin, JE |author3=Warner, PJ |author4=Haniff, CA |title=Detection of a bright feature on the surface of Betelgeuse |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=245 |date=July 1990 |page=7}}</ref> Since then, advances in [[adaptive optics]] have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can correct only a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.\n\n=== Impact on aerospace engineering ===\nIn addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions to [[aerospace engineering]], in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|graphite composite]] structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, [[radiation damage]] to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of [[multi-layer insulation]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Experience with the Hubble Space Telescope: 20 years of an archetype |journal=Optical Engineering |first=Matthew D. |last=Lallo |volume=51 |issue=1 |at=011011 |date=January 2012 |doi=10.1117/1.OE.51.1.011011 |bibcode=2012OptEn..51a1011L |arxiv=1203.0002}}</ref> One lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion.

STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=67\u201369}}\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nHubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made [[Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System]] (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of [[IRAF]], a popular astronomical data reduction program.{{sfn|Rose|2017|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n== Outreach activities ==\n[[File:Horsehead-Hubble.jpg|thumb|In 2001, NASA polled internet users to find out what they would most like Hubble to observe; they overwhelmingly selected the [[Horsehead Nebula]].]]\n[[File:Hubble Space Telescope Scale Model.JPG|thumb|right|One-quarter scale model at the courthouse in [[Marshfield, Missouri]], a hometown of [[Edwin Hubble]]]]\n\nIt has always been important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of [[taxpayer]]s to its construction and operational costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |title=National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2003 Strategic Plan |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116011129/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/1968main_strategi.pdf |archivedate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.\n\nSeveral initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.\nIn the United States, [[outreach]] efforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program.

The [[Hubble Heritage Project]], operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the [[aesthetic]] nature of Hubble images.

The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission.

Thus, no matter who is elected, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is always part of the government.<ref name=\"2006-09-24\" /> Speaking with broadcaster [[Deutschlandfunk]] in 2007, the former [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and publicist Albrecht M\u00fcller called the foundation an \"[[anti-democratic]] institution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=2231|title=Deutschlandfunk Zwischent\u00f6ne als Audio \u2013 Ein Experiment bei den Nachdenkseiten (Mitschnitt der Sendung)|date={{date|2007-04-03|mdy}}|website=Nachdenkseiten|language=de|access-date={{date|2016-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the journalist and politician Julika Sandt criticized the growing influence of the Bertelsmann Stiftung on [[German health care]], saying that initiatives developed by the foundation lead to preferential treatment for [[privatized clinic]]s and medical care centers to the detriment of self-employed physicians.
