His son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was installed by the allies as monarch. Prince Pahlavi (later crowned shah) reigned until the 1979 revolution with one brief interruption. In 1953 he fled the country after a power-struggle with his [[Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]]. Mossadegh is remembered in Iran for having been voted into power through a democratic election, [[Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry|nationalizing]] Iran's British-owned [[oil fields]], and being deposed in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by an American [[CIA]] operative and aided by the British [[MI6]]. Thus foreign powers were involved in both the installation and restoration of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nThe shah maintained a close relationship with the [[United States]], both regimes sharing a fear of the southward expansion of the Soviet state, Iran's powerful northern neighbor.

After his release he continued his agitation against the Shah, condemning the regimes's close cooperation with [[Israel]] (it gave Islamic diplomatic recognition, in addition to covet assistance) and its \"capitulations\" \u2013 the extension of diplomatic immunity to all American government personnel in Iran.

A powerful and efficient network of opposition began to develop inside Iran,<ref>Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 196.</ref> employing mosque sermons and smuggled cassette speeches by Khomeini, amongst other means. Added to this religious opposition were secular and Islamic modernist students and [[Guerrilla groups of Iran|guerrilla groups]]<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 213.</ref> \nwho admired Khomeini's history of resistance, though they would clash with his theocracy and be suppressed by his movement after the revolution.\n\n===Opposition groups and organizations===\n{{Main|Organizations of the Iranian Revolution}}\n[[Constitutionalism|Constitutionalist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Islamist]] groups opposed the Shah:\n\nThe very first signs of opposition in 1977 came from Iranian [[constitutionalist]] [[Liberalism|liberals]]. Based in the urban [[middle class]], this was a section of the population that was fairly secular and wanted the Shah to adhere to the [[Iranian Constitution of 1906]] rather than religious rule.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 502\u20133.</ref> Prominent in it was [[Mehdi Bazargan]] and his liberal, moderate Islamic group [[Freedom Movement of Iran]], and the more secular [[National Front of Iran|National Front]].\n\nThe clergy were divided, allying variously with the liberals, [[Marxist]]s and [[Islamist]]s. The various anti-Shah groups operated from outside Iran, mostly in London, France, Iraq, and [[Turkey]]. Speeches by the leaders of these groups were placed on [[audio cassette]]s to be smuggled into Iran. Khomeini, who was in exile in [[Iraq]], worked to unite clerical and secular, liberal and radical opposition under his leadership<ref>Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996), p. 276.</ref> by avoiding specifics \u2013 at least in public \u2013 that might divide the factions.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 478\u20139</ref>\n\nSeen as a proxy for the Russian menace in the north, Marxists groups were illegal and ruthlessly suppressed by [[SAVAK]] internal security apparatus. They included the communist [[Tudeh Party of Iran]]; two armed organizations, the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (OIPFG) and the breakaway [[Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (IPFG); and some minor groups.<ref name=\"Process\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/658050 \"Ideology, Culture, and Ambiguity: The Revolutionary Process in Iran\"], ''Theory and Society'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (Jun., 1996), pp. 349\u201388.</ref> The guerillas aim was to defeat the Pahlavi regime by assassination and guerilla war. Although they played an important part in the chaos of 1978 before the overthrow of the regime, they had been weakened considerably by government repression and factionalization in the first half of the 1970s.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (2004), p. 145-6</ref> They subsequently failed to pose much of a threat to the regime once it had assumed power, although the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], an Islamist-Marxist armed organization that opposed the influence of the clergy, fought against Khomeini's Islamic government.\n\nIslamists were divided into several groups. In addition to the People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran was the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]], made up of religious members of the [[National Front of Iran]] who wanted to use lawful political methods against the Shah; they were led by [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] and [[Mahmoud Taleghani]].\n\nThe Islamist group that ultimately prevailed contained the core supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini. Amongst them were some minor armed Islamist groups which joined together after the revolution in the [[Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization]].  The [[Islamic Coalition Party|Coalition of Islamic Societies]] was founded by religious bazaaris<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.80</ref> (traditional merchants). The [[Combatant Clergy Association]] comprised [[Morteza Motahhari]], [[Mohammad Beheshti]], [[Mohammad-Javad Bahonar]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Mofatteh]], who later became the major leaders of the Islamic Republic. They used a cultural approach to fight the Shah.\n\nBecause of internal repression, opposition groups abroad, like the [[Confederation of Iranian students]], the foreign branch of [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] and the [[Anjoman-e Eslami|Islamic Association of Students]], were important to the revolution.\n\n===1970\u20131977===\n{{See also|Islamic revival}}\nSeveral events in the 1970s set the stage for the 1979 revolution:\n\nIn October 1971, the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire]] was held at the site of [[Persepolis]]. Only foreign dignitaries were invited to the three-day party, whose extravagances recalled those of Persian King [[Ahasuerus|Ahasverus]] roughly 2,500 years previously. The festivities included over one ton of [[caviar]], and preparation by some two hundred chefs flown in from [[Paris]]. Cost was officially $40 million but estimated to be more in the range of $100\u2013120 million.<ref>Hiro, Dilip. Iran Under the Ayatollahs. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. 1985. p. 57.</ref> Meanwhile, drought ravaged the provinces of Baluchistan, Sistan, and even Fars where the celebrations were held. \"As the foreigners reveled on drink forbidden by Islam, Iranians were not only excluded from the festivities, some were starving.\"<ref>Wright, ''Last'' (2000), p. 220.</ref>\n\nBy late 1974 the oil boom had begun to produce not \"the Great Civilization\" promised by the Shah, but an \"alarming\" increase in inflation and waste and an \"accelerating gap\" between the rich and poor, the city and the country.<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980) p. 94.</ref> Nationalistic Iranians were angered by the tens of thousand of skilled foreign workers who came to Iran, many of them to help operate the already unpopular and expensive American high-tech military equipment that the Shah had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on.\n\nThe next year the ''[[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]'' party was created. It became not only the only party Iranians were permitted to belong to, but one the \"whole adult population\" was required to belong and pay dues to.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 174.</ref> The party attempted to take a populist stand fining and jailing merchants in its \"anti-profiteering\" campaigns, but this proved not only economically harmful but also politically counterproductive. Inflation morphed into a black market and business activity declined. Merchants were angered and politicized.<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 96.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Shah's government angered pious Iranian Muslims by changing the first year of the Iranian solar calendar from the Islamic ''hijri'' to the ascension to the throne by [[Cyrus the Great]]. \"Iran jumped overnight from the Muslim year 1355 to the royalist year 2535.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 444.</ref> The same year the Shah declared economic austerity measures to dampen inflation and waste. The resulting unemployment disproportionately affected the thousands of recent poor and unskilled migrants to the cities. Cultural and religious conservatives, many of whom were predisposed to view the Shah's secularism and Westernization as \"alien and wicked\",<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 163.</ref> went on to form the core of the revolution's demonstrators and \"martyrs\".<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1977 a new American president, [[Jimmy Carter]], was inaugurated. Carter envisioned a post-Vietnam American foreign policy that exercised power in a more benevolent way (he tried to push away from support for dictators and tyrants; for example see [[Operation Condor]]). He enlarged the Office of Human Rights created by his predecessor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Victor S.|date=1998|title=The Bureau of Human Rights during the Carter Administration|journal=The Historian|volume=61|issue=1|pages=51\u201366|issn=0018-2370|jstor=24450063|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.1998.tb01423.x}}</ref> The office proceeded to send the Shah a \"polite reminder\" of the importance of political rights and freedom. The Shah responded by granting amnesty to 357 political prisoners in February, and allowing [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to visit prisons, beginning what is said to be 'a trend of liberalization by the Shah'. Through the late spring, summer and autumn, liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the regime.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), pp. 501\u20133.</ref> Later that year a dissent group (the Writers' Association) gathered without the customary police break-up and arrests, starting a new era of political action by the Shah's opponents.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 183\u20134.</ref>\n\nThat year also saw the death of the very popular and influential modernist Islamist leader [[Ali Shariati]], allegedly at the hands of SAVAK, removing a potential revolutionary rival to Khomeini. In October, Khomeini's son Mostafa died. Though the cause appeared to be a heart attack, anti-Shah groups blamed SAVAK poisoning and proclaimed him a 'martyr.' A subsequent memorial service for Mostafa in Tehran put Khomeini back in the spotlight and began the process of building Khomeini into the leading opponent of the Shah.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref name = \"Taheri 1985 182-3\">Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), pp. 182\u20133.</ref>\n\n==General causes==\nThe [[Iranian Revolution]] had a number of unique and significant characteristics.

OPEC had Iran and Iraq sit down and work aside their differences, which resulted in relatively good relations between the two nations throughout the 1970s. In 1978 the Shah made a request to then-Vice President [[Saddam Hussein]] to banish the expatriate Ayatollah Khomenei from Iraq, who had been living there in exile for the past 15 years. In light of keeping up good relations with Iran and that Khomenei was not overly supportive of the current Iraqi regime, Hussein agreed to do this. From this point Khomenei moved to France, where he better coordinated the nascent Islamic Revolution.\n\n====External factors====\n\nBritain, the United States and the Soviet Union long competed with each other for the domination of Iran.\nBritain maintained its control of the Iranian oil industry for a long time using its alliance with power blocs, landlords\nand courts and was able to reduce the power of the US and the Soviets in Iran. The British control of the oil was already precarious given their withdrawal of forces \u201c[[east of Suez]]\u201d in the beginning of the 1970s. On the other hand, the United States \nand the Soviet Union were mainly interested in the logistically important location of Iran and wanted an oil concession \nin the northern part of Iran. The United States used its influence in the army and courts while the Soviet Union had the\ntotal support of the Tudeh Party and the CCFTU. The Shah himself was very interested in involving the United States in \nIran\u2019s efforts to reorganize the army and boost the economy with US assistance. The US could also reduce the influence\nof communism in Iran via more overt presence in Iran \n.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc., 1989. p. 52</ref> \nAs early as the late 1950s the US was fed up with the \nwidespread corruption in Iranian government and began reducing its financial assistance to Iran. In 1958, the US unsuccessfully attempted to replace the Shah with Iran\u2019s chief of staff, a reform orientated politician,\nto push for social reform in Iran \n.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc., 1989. p. 74</ref>\nAs the Shah realized how  dependent his government and the Iranian economy was on the US, he decided to liberalize his policies. Therefore in 1961, the Shah, with some pressure from the\n[[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]], opted for [[Ali Amini]] group, which had no popular base, but full US support and a clear reform program.\n\nPrime Minister Amini\u2019s agenda was to broadcast land reform, reduce corruption, stabilize the economy, limit the power of the Shah \nand reduce the size and influence of the Army. Despite having a reformist ideology, Amini did not gain popular support from \nthe National Front, identified with Mossadegh, or the Tudeh Party. Amini\u2019s government was very distrusted by the people because\nof his infamous backing of the [[The Consortium Agreement of 1954|Consortium agreement]] (re-privatizing Iranian oil in 1954) and was widely criticized by the [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] Party as spreading anti-communist propaganda; as a result he was widely perceived as being an American puppet. Amini\u2019s government fell apart after fifteen months \nof struggle with economic dilemmas, popular distrust and the Shah trying to convince Kennedy to shift his support\nfrom Amini to him. In 1962, Amini resigned and [[Asadollah Alam]], a faithful friend of the shah who had no intention of reform \nbut to consolidate the power of the monarchy, became the new prime minister and laid the ground for the Shah to\nreestablish his dictatorship in early 1963.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy \n. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc. , 1989.p.74-79</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the Shah was once again placed under US pressure for mistreatment and human rights violations of political prisoners. The paralyzing crisis of the state made the Shah concerned about the\nfuture of his throne. Although it was very undesirable for Shah to introduce another round of liberalization policies, the \nfirst round being in the early 1960s, he had no other choice but to do so. Therefore, in early 1977 Shah announced \nliberalization policies to gain US support once again and resolve the crises of the state. In mid 1977, the shah allowed an \nopen discussion forum for the Rastakhiz Party to discuss social issues publicly. Following the \nliberalization policies, the network of 80,000 mosques run by 180,000 mullahs played a crucial role in mobilizing the people against the regime.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Doubts about causes===\nCharles Kurzman, author of ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'' <ref name=\"unthinkable\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bt2GiD5OkUUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Unthinkable+Revolution+in+Iran%27 Kurzman, Charles. ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran''] (Harvard University Press, 2004)</ref> has postulated that the explanations offered by observers for why the revolution occurred \"are only partially valid,\" and that \"the closer we listen to the people who made the revolution - the more anomalies we find.\" <ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', p. 163</ref>\n\nKurzman points out that one explanation for the Shah's overthrow - the 40-day ([[Arba'een]]) cycle of commemorating deaths of protesters - \"came to a halt\" on June 17, 1978, a half year before the revolution's culmination. Moderate religious leaders such as [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] called for calm and a stay-at-home strike, which prevented more casualties to commemorate 40 days later.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (p.51)</ref> Kurzman also argues that the mourning rituals in Iran had been a political act only once before.\n\n{{quote|Could we have said in early 1977 that because Iranian culture includes a forty-day mourning cycle, the country was more likely than other countries to undergo a revolution? I think not. Rather, a knowledgeable observer would probably have noted that this mourning cycle had been put to protest purposes only once in Iranian history, in 1963, and that movement had come to naught.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (p.57)</ref>}}\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s idea that \"steadily increasing prosperity, far from tranquilizing the population, everywhere promoted a spirit of unrest\", has been offered by several observers as an explanation for the 1978\u201379 revolt.<ref name=\":1\" /> But this does not explain why \"there was very little oppositional activity\" in the recession of 1975\u201376 when unemployment and inflation were at similar levels to those of 1978.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', p. 99</ref> Furthermore, revolutions were conspicuously absent in other \"high-growth autocracies\" \u2013 Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria, Iraq \u2013 in the 1970s and 1980s despite the fact that those countries also suffered from oil wealth problems (corruption, debt, fraud, repression).<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', p. 93</ref> However, Tocqeueville\u2019s other idea that \"when a people which has put up with an oppressive rule over a long period without protest suddenly finds the government relaxing its pressure, it takes up arms against it\"<ref name=\":1\" /> would seem to solve this anomaly.\n\nAnother cause, or partial cause, in doubt is the Shah's liberalization as a result of the encouragement of President Jimmy Carter. Kurzman points out that \"even as the shah arrived in Washington\" for a state visit in late 1977, \"his regime's partial tolerance of oppositional activity was disappearing. ... In November 1977, as the shah ingratiated himself with Jimmy Carter, liberals were in retreat.\"<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (2004), p. 25</ref>\n\nAnother author, Moojan Momen, questions whether Carter \"could have said or done\" anything to save the Shah \u2013 aside from foregoing his human rights policy \u2013 since \"any direct interference by America would only have increased resentment\" against the pro-American Shah.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.287\"/>\n\n== Special theories ==\n\n=== Skocpol's cultural theory ===\n[[Theda Skocpol]], an American sociologist specializing in the study of [[Social revolution|social revolutions]], proposed an unprecedented cultural theory to account for the unique aspects of the Iranian Revolution, which she admitted falsified her past history-based theories on causes of social revolutions.\n\nSkocpol argued that the revolution diverges from past revolutions in three distinct ways:\n# The revolution does seem to have been solely caused by excessively rapid modernization by the state that led to social disruption. Skocpol\u2019s studies on prior modern social revolutions had falsified this popular but simplistic theory.\n# In a departure from historical precedents, the regime\u2019s large, modern army and the police were defeated by an internal revolution without the occurrence of a military defeat in foreign war and without external pressures aimed at causing fracture between the state and the dominant social classes.\n# The Iranian Revolution is the only modern revolution which was deliberately and coherently fomented by a revolutionary movement consisting of different social classes united under the leadership of a senior Shia cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This was achieved through demonstrations and strikes advancing with fervor against even lethal military repression. As thus the revolution achieved \u201cwhat the Western socialists had long only dreamed of doing.\u201d\nAlthough the Shah\u2019s regime had several political vulnerabilities none of them could have mattered as the Shah was still wealthy and powerful enough to overcome waves of social discontent just as other even less wealthy Third world despots had been able to. The fact that the revolution was successful can only be explained by reference to sustained extraordinary efforts by the urban Iranians to wear down and undermine the regime.\n\nDespite the negative impact of Shah\u2019s hectic modernization on the traditional form of urban life, it caused more people, consisting of the displaced villagers and farmers, to come into contact with members of traditional urban communities such as [[bazaar|bazaaris]] and  artisans. Bazaars in particular became centers of associational life, with Islamic groups and occasions tying people together through clerics' interpreting Islamic laws to settle commercial disputes and taxing the well-to-do to provide welfare for devout poorer followers. An endless succession of prayer-meetings and rituals were organized by both clergy and the laity. Bazaars also enjoyed ties with more modern sectors of Iranian society as many Iranian university students were from the merchant class. But since 1970s, Shah aroused the defense and oppositions of the bazaar by attempts at bringing under control their autonomous councils and marginalizing the clergy by taking over their educational and welfare activities. \n\nIn the mass revolutionary movements during 1977-8 the traditional urban communities played an indispensable role in making sustained mass struggle possible. The workers relied on economic aid from bazaar during their strikes and the secular opponents depended on alliance with clerics and lay leaders of the bazaar to mobilize the masses. Without these autonomous sources of support and sustenance, successful resistance against the modern political and economic power holders would\u2019ve been impossible.\n\nThe next question is how as part of a unique historical precedence, millions of Iranians were willing to face death in the mass demonstrations against brutal suppression by the army and how the clerics could rise as the leaders of the revolution. This is explained by the potential role of the Shia beliefs and clerical organization in the Iranian society. Shi'a Islam embodies substantial symbolic content to inspire resistance against unjust rule and to justify religious leaders as alternative to secular authority. As Shah aimed to marginalize the Shia clergy and eliminate their influence by its modernization policies, clerics in Qom and their followers developed a populist, anti-Imperialist interpretation of Shia theology to delegitimize Shah for his injustice and his reliance on the anti-Islamic foreign imperialists. The story of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]'s just revolt against the usurper caliph, [[Yazid I]], and his eventual martyrdom, as well as the belief in the [[Mahdi|Islamic Messiah]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who clerics claim to represent during his [[Occultation (Islam)|Occultation]], were particularly influential in victory of the revolution. As protests against the Shah began, the Shi'a clerics could claim legitimate leadership of the protests and the Husayn legend provided a framework for characterizing the Shah as a modern incarnation of the tyrant Yazid. The revolution also attracted secular Iranians who saw Shi'a Islam and Khomeini's unwavering moral leadership as an indigenous way to express common opposition to an arrogant monarch too closely associated with foreigners. Khomeini\u2019s message and appeal spread through existing networks of social links with the urban life and gradually resonated with the majority who saw Shah as being subservient to foreign powers instead of the indigenous demands of his own people. With the inspiration found in Hussein, the devout Iranians consistently defied the army with an audacity unprecedented in European revolutions and despite sustaining casualties. This sustained resistance, gradually undermined the morale of the military rank-and-file and their willingness to continue shooting into the crowds, until the state and the army succumbed before the revolution. As such a very \"traditional\" part of Iranian life could forge a very modern-looking revolutionary movement. This represented the first revolution to ever be deliberately \u201cmade\u201d by a revolutionary ideology and organization that mobilize mass followings.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-revolutions-in-the-modern-world/rentier-state-and-shia-islam-in-the-iranian-revolution/56EE3B4F3B2BF0794C0D79BC78C71B4E|title=Rentier state and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution (Chapter 10) - Social Revolutions in the Modern World|pages=240\u2013258|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139173834.011|chapter=Rentier state and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution|year=1994|isbn=9781139173834}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Iranian revolution]]\n* [[Organizations of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[History of political Islam in Iran]]\n* [[Iran and Red and black colonization]]\n* [[Anniversary of Islamic revolution]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Amuzgar, Jahangir|title=The Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution: The Pahlavis' Triumph and Tragedy: 31.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1991}}\n*{{cite book|author=Arjomand, Said Amir|title=Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988}}\n*{{cite book|author=Abrahamian, Ervand|title=Iran between two revolutions|url=https://archive.org/details/iranbetweentwore00abra_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1982}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Benard, Cheryl  |author2=Khalilzad, Zalmay  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=\"The Government of God\" \u2013 Iran's Islamic Republic\n|url=https://archive.org/details/thegovernmentofg00bena  |url-access=registration  |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1984}}   \n*{{cite book|author=Graham, Robert|title=Iran, the Illusion of Power |publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1980}}\n*{{cite book|author=Harney, Desmond|title=The priest and the king: an eyewitness account of the Iranian revolution\n|publisher=I.B.

His son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was installed by the allies as monarch. Prince Pahlavi (later crowned shah) reigned until the 1979 revolution with one brief interruption. In 1953 he fled the country after a power-struggle with his [[Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Mossadegh]]. Mossadegh is remembered in Iran for having been voted into power through a democratic election, [[Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry|nationalizing]] Iran's British-owned [[oil fields]], and being deposed in a [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] organized by an American [[CIA]] operative and aided by the British [[MI6]]. Thus foreign powers were involved in both the installation and restoration of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nThe shah maintained a close relationship with the [[United States]], both regimes sharing a fear of the southward expansion of the Soviet state, Iran's powerful northern neighbor. Leftist and Islamist groups attacked his government (often from outside Iran as they were suppressed within) for violating the Iranian constitution, [[political corruption]], and the political oppression by the [[SAVAK]] (secret police).\n\n===Rise of Ayatollah Khomeini===\n\n{{Main|Ruhollah Khomeini|Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist}}\n{{See also|Movement of 15 Khordad|Ideology of the Iranian Revolution}}\n\nShia cleric [[Ayatollah]] Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian revolution,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://hawzah.net/fa/Article/View/4790 | title=Imam Khomeini (and clerics) leadership, Islamic Revolution | publisher=hawzah.net | accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> first came to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to the Shah and his program of reforms known as the \"[[White Revolution]]\", which aimed to break up landholdings owned by some Shi\u2019a clergy, allow women to vote and [[religious minorities]] to hold office, and finally grant women legal equality in marital issues.\n\nKhomeini declared that the Shah had \"embarked on the destruction of Islam in Iran\"<ref>''Nehzat'' by Ruhani vol. 1 p. 195, quoted in Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 75.</ref> and publicly denounced the Shah as a \"wretched miserable man.\" Following Khomeini's arrest on June 5, 1963, three days of major riots erupted throughout Iran, with Khomeini supporters claiming 15,000 were killed by police fire.<ref>''Islam and Revolution'', p. 17; Later, much lower estimates of 380 dead can be found in Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini: Life of the Ayatolla,'' (2000), p. 112.</ref> Khomeini was detained and kept under house arrest for 8 months. After his release he continued his agitation against the Shah, condemning the regimes's close cooperation with [[Israel]] (it gave Islamic diplomatic recognition, in addition to covet assistance) and its \"capitulations\" \u2013 the extension of diplomatic immunity to all American government personnel in Iran. In November 1964, Khomeini was re-arrested and sent into exile, where he remained for 14 years until the revolution.\n\nA period of \"disaffected calm\" followed.<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' 1980, p. 69.</ref> Despite political repression, the budding Islamic revival began to undermine the idea of \u2018Westernization as progress\u2019 that was the basis of the Shah's secular regime forming the [[Ideology of Iranian Revolution|ideology of the revolution]].

A powerful and efficient network of opposition began to develop inside Iran,<ref>Taheri, ''The Spirit of Allah'' (1985), p. 196.</ref> employing mosque sermons and smuggled cassette speeches by Khomeini, amongst other means. Added to this religious opposition were secular and Islamic modernist students and [[Guerrilla groups of Iran|guerrilla groups]]<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 213.</ref> \nwho admired Khomeini's history of resistance, though they would clash with his theocracy and be suppressed by his movement after the revolution.\n\n===Opposition groups and organizations===\n{{Main|Organizations of the Iranian Revolution}}\n[[Constitutionalism|Constitutionalist]], [[Marxist]], and [[Islamist]] groups opposed the Shah:\n\nThe very first signs of opposition in 1977 came from Iranian [[constitutionalist]] [[Liberalism|liberals]]. Based in the urban [[middle class]], this was a section of the population that was fairly secular and wanted the Shah to adhere to the [[Iranian Constitution of 1906]] rather than religious rule.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 502\u20133.</ref> Prominent in it was [[Mehdi Bazargan]] and his liberal, moderate Islamic group [[Freedom Movement of Iran]], and the more secular [[National Front of Iran|National Front]].\n\nThe clergy were divided, allying variously with the liberals, [[Marxist]]s and [[Islamist]]s. The various anti-Shah groups operated from outside Iran, mostly in London, France, Iraq, and [[Turkey]]. Speeches by the leaders of these groups were placed on [[audio cassette]]s to be smuggled into Iran. Khomeini, who was in exile in [[Iraq]], worked to unite clerical and secular, liberal and radical opposition under his leadership<ref>Mackay, ''Iranians'' (1996), p. 276.</ref> by avoiding specifics \u2013 at least in public \u2013 that might divide the factions.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran Between'' (1980), pp. 478\u20139</ref>\n\nSeen as a proxy for the Russian menace in the north, Marxists groups were illegal and ruthlessly suppressed by [[SAVAK]] internal security apparatus. They included the communist [[Tudeh Party of Iran]]; two armed organizations, the [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (OIPFG) and the breakaway [[Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas]] (IPFG); and some minor groups.<ref name=\"Process\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/658050 \"Ideology, Culture, and Ambiguity: The Revolutionary Process in Iran\"], ''Theory and Society'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (Jun., 1996), pp. 349\u201388.</ref> The guerillas aim was to defeat the Pahlavi regime by assassination and guerilla war. Although they played an important part in the chaos of 1978 before the overthrow of the regime, they had been weakened considerably by government repression and factionalization in the first half of the 1970s.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (2004), p. 145-6</ref> They subsequently failed to pose much of a threat to the regime once it had assumed power, although the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], an Islamist-Marxist armed organization that opposed the influence of the clergy, fought against Khomeini's Islamic government.\n\nIslamists were divided into several groups. In addition to the People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran was the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]], made up of religious members of the [[National Front of Iran]] who wanted to use lawful political methods against the Shah; they were led by [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] and [[Mahmoud Taleghani]].\n\nThe Islamist group that ultimately prevailed contained the core supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini. Amongst them were some minor armed Islamist groups which joined together after the revolution in the [[Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization]].  The [[Islamic Coalition Party|Coalition of Islamic Societies]] was founded by religious bazaaris<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p.80</ref> (traditional merchants). The [[Combatant Clergy Association]] comprised [[Morteza Motahhari]], [[Mohammad Beheshti]], [[Mohammad-Javad Bahonar]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Mofatteh]], who later became the major leaders of the Islamic Republic. They used a cultural approach to fight the Shah.\n\nBecause of internal repression, opposition groups abroad, like the [[Confederation of Iranian students]], the foreign branch of [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] and the [[Anjoman-e Eslami|Islamic Association of Students]], were important to the revolution.\n\n===1970\u20131977===\n{{See also|Islamic revival}}\nSeveral events in the 1970s set the stage for the 1979 revolution:\n\nIn October 1971, the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire]] was held at the site of [[Persepolis]]. Only foreign dignitaries were invited to the three-day party, whose extravagances recalled those of Persian King [[Ahasuerus|Ahasverus]] roughly 2,500 years previously. The festivities included over one ton of [[caviar]], and preparation by some two hundred chefs flown in from [[Paris]]. Cost was officially $40 million but estimated to be more in the range of $100\u2013120 million.<ref>Hiro, Dilip. Iran Under the Ayatollahs. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. 1985. p. 57.</ref> Meanwhile, drought ravaged the provinces of Baluchistan, Sistan, and even Fars where the celebrations were held. \"As the foreigners reveled on drink forbidden by Islam, Iranians were not only excluded from the festivities, some were starving.\"<ref>Wright, ''Last'' (2000), p. 220.</ref>\n\nBy late 1974 the oil boom had begun to produce not \"the Great Civilization\" promised by the Shah, but an \"alarming\" increase in inflation and waste and an \"accelerating gap\" between the rich and poor, the city and the country.<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980) p. 94.</ref> Nationalistic Iranians were angered by the tens of thousand of skilled foreign workers who came to Iran, many of them to help operate the already unpopular and expensive American high-tech military equipment that the Shah had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on.\n\nThe next year the ''[[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]'' party was created. It became not only the only party Iranians were permitted to belong to, but one the \"whole adult population\" was required to belong and pay dues to.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 174.</ref> The party attempted to take a populist stand fining and jailing merchants in its \"anti-profiteering\" campaigns, but this proved not only economically harmful but also politically counterproductive. Inflation morphed into a black market and business activity declined. Merchants were angered and politicized.<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 96.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the Shah's government angered pious Iranian Muslims by changing the first year of the Iranian solar calendar from the Islamic ''hijri'' to the ascension to the throne by [[Cyrus the Great]]. \"Iran jumped overnight from the Muslim year 1355 to the royalist year 2535.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), p. 444.</ref> The same year the Shah declared economic austerity measures to dampen inflation and waste. The resulting unemployment disproportionately affected the thousands of recent poor and unskilled migrants to the cities. Cultural and religious conservatives, many of whom were predisposed to view the Shah's secularism and Westernization as \"alien and wicked\",<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 163.</ref> went on to form the core of the revolution's demonstrators and \"martyrs\".<ref>Graham, ''Iran'' (1980), p. 226.</ref>\n\nIn 1977 a new American president, [[Jimmy Carter]], was inaugurated. Carter envisioned a post-Vietnam American foreign policy that exercised power in a more benevolent way (he tried to push away from support for dictators and tyrants; for example see [[Operation Condor]]). He enlarged the Office of Human Rights created by his predecessor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Victor S.|date=1998|title=The Bureau of Human Rights during the Carter Administration|journal=The Historian|volume=61|issue=1|pages=51\u201366|issn=0018-2370|jstor=24450063|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.1998.tb01423.x}}</ref> The office proceeded to send the Shah a \"polite reminder\" of the importance of political rights and freedom. The Shah responded by granting amnesty to 357 political prisoners in February, and allowing [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to visit prisons, beginning what is said to be 'a trend of liberalization by the Shah'. Through the late spring, summer and autumn, liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the regime.<ref>Abrahamian, ''Iran'' (1982), pp. 501\u20133.</ref> Later that year a dissent group (the Writers' Association) gathered without the customary police break-up and arrests, starting a new era of political action by the Shah's opponents.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 183\u20134.</ref>\n\nThat year also saw the death of the very popular and influential modernist Islamist leader [[Ali Shariati]], allegedly at the hands of SAVAK, removing a potential revolutionary rival to Khomeini. In October, Khomeini's son Mostafa died. Though the cause appeared to be a heart attack, anti-Shah groups blamed SAVAK poisoning and proclaimed him a 'martyr.' A subsequent memorial service for Mostafa in Tehran put Khomeini back in the spotlight and began the process of building Khomeini into the leading opponent of the Shah.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2000), pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref name = \"Taheri 1985 182-3\">Taheri, ''Spirit'' (1985), pp. 182\u20133.</ref>\n\n==General causes==\nThe [[Iranian Revolution]] had a number of unique and significant characteristics.

OPEC had Iran and Iraq sit down and work aside their differences, which resulted in relatively good relations between the two nations throughout the 1970s. In 1978 the Shah made a request to then-Vice President [[Saddam Hussein]] to banish the expatriate Ayatollah Khomenei from Iraq, who had been living there in exile for the past 15 years. In light of keeping up good relations with Iran and that Khomenei was not overly supportive of the current Iraqi regime, Hussein agreed to do this. From this point Khomenei moved to France, where he better coordinated the nascent Islamic Revolution.\n\n====External factors====\n\nBritain, the United States and the Soviet Union long competed with each other for the domination of Iran.\nBritain maintained its control of the Iranian oil industry for a long time using its alliance with power blocs, landlords\nand courts and was able to reduce the power of the US and the Soviets in Iran. The British control of the oil was already precarious given their withdrawal of forces \u201c[[east of Suez]]\u201d in the beginning of the 1970s. On the other hand, the United States \nand the Soviet Union were mainly interested in the logistically important location of Iran and wanted an oil concession \nin the northern part of Iran. The United States used its influence in the army and courts while the Soviet Union had the\ntotal support of the Tudeh Party and the CCFTU. The Shah himself was very interested in involving the United States in \nIran\u2019s efforts to reorganize the army and boost the economy with US assistance. The US could also reduce the influence\nof communism in Iran via more overt presence in Iran \n.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc., 1989. p. 52</ref> \nAs early as the late 1950s the US was fed up with the \nwidespread corruption in Iranian government and began reducing its financial assistance to Iran. In 1958, the US unsuccessfully attempted to replace the Shah with Iran\u2019s chief of staff, a reform orientated politician,\nto push for social reform in Iran \n.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc., 1989. p. 74</ref>\nAs the Shah realized how  dependent his government and the Iranian economy was on the US, he decided to liberalize his policies. Therefore in 1961, the Shah, with some pressure from the\n[[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]], opted for [[Ali Amini]] group, which had no popular base, but full US support and a clear reform program.\n\nPrime Minister Amini\u2019s agenda was to broadcast land reform, reduce corruption, stabilize the economy, limit the power of the Shah \nand reduce the size and influence of the Army. Despite having a reformist ideology, Amini did not gain popular support from \nthe National Front, identified with Mossadegh, or the Tudeh Party. Amini\u2019s government was very distrusted by the people because\nof his infamous backing of the [[The Consortium Agreement of 1954|Consortium agreement]] (re-privatizing Iranian oil in 1954) and was widely criticized by the [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] Party as spreading anti-communist propaganda; as a result he was widely perceived as being an American puppet. Amini\u2019s government fell apart after fifteen months \nof struggle with economic dilemmas, popular distrust and the Shah trying to convince Kennedy to shift his support\nfrom Amini to him. In 1962, Amini resigned and [[Asadollah Alam]], a faithful friend of the shah who had no intention of reform \nbut to consolidate the power of the monarchy, became the new prime minister and laid the ground for the Shah to\nreestablish his dictatorship in early 1963.<ref>Amjad, Mohammed. Iran from Royal Dictatorship to Theocracy \n. New York : Greenwood Press, Inc. , 1989.p.74-79</ref>\n\nIn the mid 1970s, the Shah was once again placed under US pressure for mistreatment and human rights violations of political prisoners. The paralyzing crisis of the state made the Shah concerned about the\nfuture of his throne. Although it was very undesirable for Shah to introduce another round of liberalization policies, the \nfirst round being in the early 1960s, he had no other choice but to do so. Therefore, in early 1977 Shah announced \nliberalization policies to gain US support once again and resolve the crises of the state. In mid 1977, the shah allowed an \nopen discussion forum for the Rastakhiz Party to discuss social issues publicly. Following the \nliberalization policies, the network of 80,000 mosques run by 180,000 mullahs played a crucial role in mobilizing the people against the regime.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Doubts about causes===\nCharles Kurzman, author of ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'' <ref name=\"unthinkable\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bt2GiD5OkUUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Unthinkable+Revolution+in+Iran%27 Kurzman, Charles.

Moderate religious leaders such as [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] called for calm and a stay-at-home strike, which prevented more casualties to commemorate 40 days later.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (p.51)</ref> Kurzman also argues that the mourning rituals in Iran had been a political act only once before.\n\n{{quote|Could we have said in early 1977 that because Iranian culture includes a forty-day mourning cycle, the country was more likely than other countries to undergo a revolution? I think not. Rather, a knowledgeable observer would probably have noted that this mourning cycle had been put to protest purposes only once in Iranian history, in 1963, and that movement had come to naught.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (p.57)</ref>}}\n\n[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s idea that \"steadily increasing prosperity, far from tranquilizing the population, everywhere promoted a spirit of unrest\", has been offered by several observers as an explanation for the 1978\u201379 revolt.<ref name=\":1\" /> But this does not explain why \"there was very little oppositional activity\" in the recession of 1975\u201376 when unemployment and inflation were at similar levels to those of 1978.<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', p. 99</ref> Furthermore, revolutions were conspicuously absent in other \"high-growth autocracies\" \u2013 Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria, Iraq \u2013 in the 1970s and 1980s despite the fact that those countries also suffered from oil wealth problems (corruption, debt, fraud, repression).<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', p. 93</ref> However, Tocqeueville\u2019s other idea that \"when a people which has put up with an oppressive rule over a long period without protest suddenly finds the government relaxing its pressure, it takes up arms against it\"<ref name=\":1\" /> would seem to solve this anomaly.\n\nAnother cause, or partial cause, in doubt is the Shah's liberalization as a result of the encouragement of President Jimmy Carter. Kurzman points out that \"even as the shah arrived in Washington\" for a state visit in late 1977, \"his regime's partial tolerance of oppositional activity was disappearing. ... In November 1977, as the shah ingratiated himself with Jimmy Carter, liberals were in retreat.\"<ref>Kurzman, ''The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran'', (2004), p. 25</ref>\n\nAnother author, Moojan Momen, questions whether Carter \"could have said or done\" anything to save the Shah \u2013 aside from foregoing his human rights policy \u2013 since \"any direct interference by America would only have increased resentment\" against the pro-American Shah.<ref name=\"Momen, Moojan 1985, p.287\"/>\n\n== Special theories ==\n\n=== Skocpol's cultural theory ===\n[[Theda Skocpol]], an American sociologist specializing in the study of [[Social revolution|social revolutions]], proposed an unprecedented cultural theory to account for the unique aspects of the Iranian Revolution, which she admitted falsified her past history-based theories on causes of social revolutions.\n\nSkocpol argued that the revolution diverges from past revolutions in three distinct ways:\n# The revolution does seem to have been solely caused by excessively rapid modernization by the state that led to social disruption. Skocpol\u2019s studies on prior modern social revolutions had falsified this popular but simplistic theory.\n# In a departure from historical precedents, the regime\u2019s large, modern army and the police were defeated by an internal revolution without the occurrence of a military defeat in foreign war and without external pressures aimed at causing fracture between the state and the dominant social classes.\n# The Iranian Revolution is the only modern revolution which was deliberately and coherently fomented by a revolutionary movement consisting of different social classes united under the leadership of a senior Shia cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This was achieved through demonstrations and strikes advancing with fervor against even lethal military repression. As thus the revolution achieved \u201cwhat the Western socialists had long only dreamed of doing.\u201d\nAlthough the Shah\u2019s regime had several political vulnerabilities none of them could have mattered as the Shah was still wealthy and powerful enough to overcome waves of social discontent just as other even less wealthy Third world despots had been able to. The fact that the revolution was successful can only be explained by reference to sustained extraordinary efforts by the urban Iranians to wear down and undermine the regime.\n\nDespite the negative impact of Shah\u2019s hectic modernization on the traditional form of urban life, it caused more people, consisting of the displaced villagers and farmers, to come into contact with members of traditional urban communities such as [[bazaar|bazaaris]] and  artisans. Bazaars in particular became centers of associational life, with Islamic groups and occasions tying people together through clerics' interpreting Islamic laws to settle commercial disputes and taxing the well-to-do to provide welfare for devout poorer followers. An endless succession of prayer-meetings and rituals were organized by both clergy and the laity. Bazaars also enjoyed ties with more modern sectors of Iranian society as many Iranian university students were from the merchant class. But since 1970s, Shah aroused the defense and oppositions of the bazaar by attempts at bringing under control their autonomous councils and marginalizing the clergy by taking over their educational and welfare activities. \n\nIn the mass revolutionary movements during 1977-8 the traditional urban communities played an indispensable role in making sustained mass struggle possible. The workers relied on economic aid from bazaar during their strikes and the secular opponents depended on alliance with clerics and lay leaders of the bazaar to mobilize the masses. Without these autonomous sources of support and sustenance, successful resistance against the modern political and economic power holders would\u2019ve been impossible.\n\nThe next question is how as part of a unique historical precedence, millions of Iranians were willing to face death in the mass demonstrations against brutal suppression by the army and how the clerics could rise as the leaders of the revolution. This is explained by the potential role of the Shia beliefs and clerical organization in the Iranian society. Shi'a Islam embodies substantial symbolic content to inspire resistance against unjust rule and to justify religious leaders as alternative to secular authority. As Shah aimed to marginalize the Shia clergy and eliminate their influence by its modernization policies, clerics in Qom and their followers developed a populist, anti-Imperialist interpretation of Shia theology to delegitimize Shah for his injustice and his reliance on the anti-Islamic foreign imperialists. The story of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]'s just revolt against the usurper caliph, [[Yazid I]], and his eventual martyrdom, as well as the belief in the [[Mahdi|Islamic Messiah]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who clerics claim to represent during his [[Occultation (Islam)|Occultation]], were particularly influential in victory of the revolution. As protests against the Shah began, the Shi'a clerics could claim legitimate leadership of the protests and the Husayn legend provided a framework for characterizing the Shah as a modern incarnation of the tyrant Yazid. The revolution also attracted secular Iranians who saw Shi'a Islam and Khomeini's unwavering moral leadership as an indigenous way to express common opposition to an arrogant monarch too closely associated with foreigners. Khomeini\u2019s message and appeal spread through existing networks of social links with the urban life and gradually resonated with the majority who saw Shah as being subservient to foreign powers instead of the indigenous demands of his own people. With the inspiration found in Hussein, the devout Iranians consistently defied the army with an audacity unprecedented in European revolutions and despite sustaining casualties. This sustained resistance, gradually undermined the morale of the military rank-and-file and their willingness to continue shooting into the crowds, until the state and the army succumbed before the revolution. As such a very \"traditional\" part of Iranian life could forge a very modern-looking revolutionary movement. This represented the first revolution to ever be deliberately \u201cmade\u201d by a revolutionary ideology and organization that mobilize mass followings.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-revolutions-in-the-modern-world/rentier-state-and-shia-islam-in-the-iranian-revolution/56EE3B4F3B2BF0794C0D79BC78C71B4E|title=Rentier state and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution (Chapter 10) - Social Revolutions in the Modern World|pages=240\u2013258|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24|doi=10.1017/CBO9781139173834.011|chapter=Rentier state and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution|year=1994|isbn=9781139173834}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Iranian revolution]]\n* [[Organizations of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[History of political Islam in Iran]]\n* [[Iran and Red and black colonization]]\n* [[Anniversary of Islamic revolution]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Amuzgar, Jahangir|title=The Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution: The Pahlavis' Triumph and Tragedy: 31.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1991}}\n*{{cite book|author=Arjomand, Said Amir|title=Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988}}\n*{{cite book|author=Abrahamian, Ervand|title=Iran between two revolutions|url=https://archive.org/details/iranbetweentwore00abra_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1982}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Benard, Cheryl  |author2=Khalilzad, Zalmay  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=\"The Government of God\" \u2013 Iran's Islamic Republic\n|url=https://archive.org/details/thegovernmentofg00bena  |url-access=registration  |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1984}}   \n*{{cite book|author=Graham, Robert|title=Iran, the Illusion of Power |publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1980}}\n*{{cite book|author=Harney, Desmond|title=The priest and the king: an eyewitness account of the Iranian revolution\n|publisher=I.B.

The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.\n\n==History and creation==\nVarious different methods had been used previously to resolve rain-affected cricket games, with the most common being the [[Average Run Rate method]] and the [[Most Productive Overs method]]. \n\nThese earlier methods, while simple in nature, had intrinsic flaws that meant they produced unfair revised targets that altered the balance of the match, and were easily exploitable:\n* The Average Run Rate method took no account of how many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply reflected how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So, if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. \n* The Most Productive Overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalised the team batting second for good bowling by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.\n\n[[File:India Vs New zealand One day International, 10 December 2010 (6159936713).jpg|thumb|D/L began in [[one-day international]]s]]\n\nThe D/L method was devised by two British [[statistician]]s, [[Frank Duckworth]] and [[Tony Lewis (mathematician)|Tony Lewis]], as a result of the outcome to the semi-final in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]] between England and South Africa, where the ''Most Productive Overs'' method was used. Rain stopped play for 12 minutes with [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] needing 22 runs from 13 balls. The revised target left South Africa needing 21 runs from one ball, a reduction of only one run compared to a reduction of two overs, and a virtually impossible target given that the maximum score from one ball is generally six runs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Miller|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/280142.html|title=22 off one ball \u2013 A farcical rain rule leaves everyone bewildered|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|work=Cricinfo|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nDuckworth said, \"I recall hearing [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] on radio saying 'surely someone, somewhere could come up with something better' and I soon realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/274677.html|title=A decade of Duckworth-Lewis|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=1 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A decade of Duckworth-Lewis|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6222943.stm |work=BBC Sport|date=1 January 2007}}</ref> \n\nThe D/L method avoids this flaw: in this match, the revised D/L target would have left South Africa four to tie or five to win from the final ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/tms/6502207.stm|title=Stump the Bearded Wonder|work=BBC Sport|date=28 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe D/L method was first used in international cricket on 1 January 1997 in the second match of the Zimbabwe versus England [[One Day International|ODI]] series, which [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] won by seven runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1996-97/ENG_IN_ZIM/ENG_ZIM_ODI2_01JAN1997.html|title=Full Scorecard of Zimbabwe v England 2nd ODI 1997|date=1 January 1997|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|work=Cricinfo}}</ref> The D/L method was formally adopted by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] in 1999 as the standard method of calculating target scores in rain-shortened [[one-day cricket|one-day]] matches.\n\n==Theory==\n===Calculation summary===\nThe essence of the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to score as many runs as possible: the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s they have to receive; and the number of [[Dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] they have in hand. At any point in any [[innings]], a team's ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources they have left. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.com.au/analytical-ideas/cricket/|title=The Duckworth-Lewis Method|publisher=Data Analysis Australia|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:(Duckworth Lewis) method of adjusting target scores.PNG|thumb|300px|A published table of resource remaining percentages, for all combinations of wickets lost and whole overs left]]\n\nThe D/L method converts all possible combinations of overs (or, more accurately, balls) and wickets left into a combined resources remaining [[percentage]] figure (with 50 overs and 10 wickets = 100%), and these are all stored in a published table or computer. The target score for the team batting second ('Team 2') can be adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first ('Team 1') achieved using these resource percentages, to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches (the 'Professional Edition'), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the two teams' resources, i.e.\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nIf, as usually occurs, this 'par score' is a non-[[integer]] number of runs, then Team 2's target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to [[The result in cricket#Tie|tie]] (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If Team 2 reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when Team 2 has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If Team 2 fail to reach the par score then they have lost.\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 254 with 100% of resources available, then 254&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;90%&nbsp;/&nbsp;100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;228.6, so Team 2's target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DL_FAQ.html|title=D/L method: answers to frequently asked questions|author1=Frank Duckworth|author2=Tony Lewis|work=Crickinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=December 2008}}</ref> so a computer which has this software loaded must be used.\n\nIf it is a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\text{Team 2's resources}. </math>\n\n===Summary of impact on Team 2's target===\n*If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced but still the same as each other, then D/L makes no change to the target score, because both sides are aware of the total number of overs and wickets throughout their innings, thus they will have the same resources available.\n*Team 2's target score is first calculated once Team 1's innings has finished.\n*If there were interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 ''thought'' they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings was going to be shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 ''does'' have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they thought they would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.\n:For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, thinking they would have 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.\n*If there are interruption(s) to Team 2's innings, either before it starts, during, or it is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1's innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.\n*If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were bigger.\n\n===Mathematical theory===\nThe original D/L model started by assuming that the number of runs that can still be scored (called <math>Z</math>), for a given number of overs remaining (called <math>u</math>) and wickets lost (called <math>w</math>), takes the following [[exponential decay]] relationship:<ref name=OrigPaper>{{Cite journal |last1=Duckworth |first1=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=1998 |title=A fair method for resetting the target in interrupted one-day cricket matches |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=220\u2013227 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600524 |citeseerx=10.1.1.180.3272 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>Z(u,w) = Z_0(w)\\left({1 - e^{-b(w)u} } \\right),</math>\n\nwhere the constant <math>Z_0</math> is the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] average total score in unlimited overs (under one-day rules), and <math>b</math> is the exponential decay constant. Both vary with <math>w</math> (only). The values of these two parameters for each <math>w</math> from 0 to 9 were [[Estimation|estimated]] from scores from 'hundreds of one-day internationals' and 'extensive research and experimentation', though were not disclosed due to 'commercial confidentiality'.<ref name=\"OrigPaper\"/>\n\n[[Image:DuckworthLewisEng.png|right|Scoring potential as a function of [[wicket]]s and [[over (cricket)|overs]].]]\nFinding the value of <math>Z</math> for a particular combination of <math>u</math> and <math>w</math> (by putting in <math>u</math> and the values of these constants for the particular <math>w</math>), and dividing this by the score achievable at the start of the innings, i.e. finding\n:<math>P(u,w) = \\frac{Z(u,w)}{Z(u=50,w=0)},\\,</math>\ngives the proportion of the combined run scoring resources of the innings remaining when <math>u</math> overs are left and <math>w</math> wickets are down.<ref name=\"OrigPaper\"/> These proportions can be plotted in a graph, as shown right, or shown in a single table, as shown below.\n\nThis became the Standard Edition. When it was introduced, it was necessary that D/L could be implemented with a single table of\nresource percentages, as it could not be guaranteed that computers would be present. Therefore, this single formula was used giving average resources. This method relies on the assumption that average performance is proportional to the mean, irrespective of the actual score. This was good enough in 95 per cent of matches, but in the 5 per cent of matches with very high scores, the simple approach started to break down.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=Frank |year=2008 |title=The Duckworth/Lewis method: an exercise in Maths, Stats, OR and communications |journal=MSOR Connections |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=11\u201314 |url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/msor.8.3d.pdf |publisher=HE Academy|doi=10.11120/msor.2008.08030011 }}</ref> To overcome the problem, an upgraded formula was proposed with an additional parameter whose value depends on the Team 1 innings.<ref name=SecondPaper>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=2004 |title=A successful Operational Research intervention in one-day cricket |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=749\u2013759 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601717 |pmid= |bibcode= |ref=}}</ref> This became the Professional Edition.\n\n==Examples==\n===Stoppage in first innings===\n====Increased target====\nIn the 4th [[Indian Cricket Team|India]] \u2013 [[England cricket team|England]] ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England ''knew'' they had only 22 overs the expectation is that they will be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as \"India won by 19 runs (D/L method)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/indveng/engine/current/match/361046.html |work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|title=Full Scoreboard of India vs England 4th ODI 2008|date=23 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the fifth ODI between India and South Africa in January 2011, rain halted play twice during the first innings.

As the number of overs was reduced during South Africa's innings, this method takes into account what South Africa are likely to have scored if they had known throughout their innings that it would only be 46 overs long, and so the match was listed as \"South Africa won by 33 runs (D/L method)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/463154.html|title= Full Scorecard South Africa v India 5th ODI 2011|date= 23 January 2011|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n\n====Decreased target====\nOn 3 December 2014, [[Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team|Sri Lanka]] played [[England_cricket_team|England]] and batted first, but play was interrupted when Sri Lanka had scored 6/1 from 2 overs.

Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan's target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as \"Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)\".\n\nThe D/L method was used in the group stage match between [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20#Group B|20/20 World Cup in 2010]]. Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe's target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs. The retrospective D/L target from 5 overs was a further reduction to 44, or a par score of 43, and hence Sri Lanka won the match by 14 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/world-twenty20-2010/engine/current/match/412686.html|title=Full Scorecard of Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe ICC Men's T20 World Cup 7th Match Group B|date=3 May 2010|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/world-twenty20-2010/content/story/458306.html|title=Jayawardene ton floors Zimbabwe|date=3 May 2010|author=Sriram Veera|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n\nAn example of a D/L tied match was the ODI between England and India on 11 September 2011. This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score played a key role in tactical decisions during those overs. At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tie.\n\nThis example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a [[dot ball]] \u2013 indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.\n\n===Stoppages in both innings===\nDuring the [[2012\u201313 Big Bash League season#Knockout stage 2|2012/13 KFC Big Bash League]], D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the [[Melbourne Stars]] and the [[Perth Scorchers]]. After rain delayed the start of the match, it interrupted Melbourne's innings when they had scored 159/1 off 15.2 overs, and both innings were reduced by 2 overs to 18, and Melbourne finished on 183/2. After a further rain delay reduced Perth's innings to 17 overs, Perth returned to the field to face 13 overs, with a revised target of 139. Perth won the game by 8 wickets with a boundary off the final ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/571265.html|title=Full Scorecard of Perth Scorchers vs Melbourne Stars, Big Bash League 2nd semi-final|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=16 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/big-bash-league-2012/content/story/601098.html|title=Scorchers prevail in dramatic, rain-hit match|author=Alex Malcolm|date=16 January 2013|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref>\n\n==Use and updates==\nThe published table that underpins the D/L method is regularly updated,{{what|date=August 2019}} using source data from more recent matches.{{when|date=August 2019}}\n\nFor 50-over matches decided by D/L, each team must face at least 20 overs for the result to be valid.

If the conditions prevent a match from reaching this minimum length, it is declared a [[no result]].\n\n===1996\u20132003 \u2013 Single version===\nUntil 2003, a single version of D/L was in use. This used a single published reference table of total resource percentages remaining for all possible combinations of overs and wickets,<ref name=\"DLMethod\">[http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/3140-fc-domestic-duckworthlewis-2013-p127-140-lr-12376.pdf Duckworth/Lewis Method of Re-calculating the Target Score in an Interrupted Match] ECB, 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211845/http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/3140-fc-domestic-duckworthlewis-2013-p127-140-lr-12376.pdf |date=22 February 2014 }}</ref> and some simple [[mathematical]] calculations, and was relatively transparent and straightforward to implement.\n\nHowever, a flaw in how it handled very high first innings scores (350+) became apparent from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required.<ref name=FAQ/> Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.\n\nIn 2002 the resource percentages were revised, following an extensive analysis of limited overs matches, and there was a change to the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method#Step 2. Convert the two teams.27 batting resources into Team 2.27s target score|G50]] for ODIs. (G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match.) G50 was changed to 235 for ODIs. These changes came into effect on 1 September 2002.<ref name=\"DLM2002\"/> As of 2014, these resource percentages are the ones still in use in the Standard Edition, though G50 has subsequently changed.\n\nThe tables show how the percentages were in 1999 and 2001, and what they were changed to in 2002.

These changes recognised that teams need to start out with a higher scoring rate when chasing high targets rather than keep wickets in hand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duckworth-Lewis method in new avatar for World Cup|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/841481.html|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|accessdate=7 July 2016|date=1 March 2015|author=Daniel Brettig}}</ref>\n\n==Target score calculations==\nUsing the [[notation]] of the ICC Playing Handbook,<ref name=\"ICCPH\"/> the team that bats first is called Team 1, their final score is called S, the total resources available to Team 1 for their innings is called R1, the team that bats second is called Team 2, and the total resources available to Team 2 for their innings is called R2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || 30.8 || 28.3 || 22.8 || 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\n===Step 1. Find the batting resources available to each team===\n\nAfter each reduction in overs, the new total batting resources available to the two teams are found, using figures for the total amount of batting resources ''remaining'' for any combination of overs and wickets. While the process for converting these resources remaining figures into total resource available figures is the same in the two Editions, this can be done manually in the Standard Edition, as the resource remaining figures are published in a reference table.<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/> However, the resource remaining figures used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ/> so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.\n\n*If a team loses resource at the ''start'' of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is the resource available.\n*If a team loses resource at the ''end'' of its innings (centre image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and [[subtraction|subtracting]] the resources remaining at the point the innings was ended. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but its innings is ended with 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 52.4% = 47.6%.\n*If a team loses resource in the ''middle'' of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% &minus; 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% &minus; 25.4% = 74.6%.\n\n'''[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag1.png|300px|DuckworthLewisDiag1]]''' \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag2.png|330px|DuckworthLewisDiag2]] \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag3.png|360px|DuckworthLewisDiag3]]\n\nThese are just the different ways of having one interruption. With multiple interruptions possible, it may seem like finding the total resource percentage requires a different calculation for each different scenario. However, the formula is actually the same each time &minus; it's just that different scenarios, with more or less interruptions and restarts, need to use more or less of the same formula. The total resources available to a team are given by:<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nwhich can alternatively be written as:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nEach time there's an interruption or a restart after an interruption, the resource remaining percentages at those times (obtained from a reference table for the Standard Edition, or from a computer for the Professional Edition) can be entered into the formula, with the rest left blank. Note that a delay at the start of an innings counts as the 1st interruption.\n\n===Step 2. Convert the two teams' batting resources into Team 2's target score===\n\n'''Standard Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score by the extra runs that could be expected to be scored on average with the extra total resource, i.e. '''S&nbsp;+&nbsp;G50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(R2&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;R1)/100''', where G50 is the average 50-over total.

In fact it would be possible for the two captains to agree a value of G50 before the start of each match, taking account of all relevant factors. However, we do not believe that something that is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way. In any case, it should be realised that the value of G50 usually has very little effect on the revised target.

Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralises the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 &minus; 122 = 75 runs.\n\nThis formula for Netherlands' par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time.

The formula required Netherlands to match Australia's performance with their overlapping 72.6% of resource (i.e. score 170 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 84.1% &minus; 72.6% = 11.5% of resource (i.e. score 11.5% of G50 (235 at the time) = 27.025 runs).\n\nAfter the match there were reports in the media<ref name=\"AusNedReport\"/> that Australia had batted conservatively in their final 8 overs after the final restart, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, in the same way that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.\n\nAs Australia's innings was interrupted three times (once before it started) and restarted three times, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows:\n\nTotal resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart = 100% &minus; 100% + 97.1% &minus; 55.8% + 50.5% &minus; 44.7% + 25.5% = 72.6%.\n\n==In-game strategy==\n===During team 1's innings===\n====Strategy for team 1====\nDuring Team 1's innings, the target score calculations (as described above), have not yet been made.\n\nThe objective of the team batting first is to maximise the target score which will be calculated for the team batting second, which (in the Professional Edition) will be determined by the formula:\n\n<math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nFor these three terms:\n*'''Team 1's score''': Team 1 will always increase Team 2's target by increasing their own score. \n*At the start of Team 2's innings, '''Team 2's resources''' will be 10 wickets and the number of overs available, and Team 1 cannot affect this.\n*'''Team 1's resources''' are given by:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nIf there will not be any future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then the amount of resource available to them is now fixed (whether there have been interruptions so far or not), so the only thing Team 1 can do to increase Team 2's target is increase their own score, ignoring how many wickets they lose (as in a normal unaffected match).\n\nHowever, if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then an alternative strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs ''and'' preserve resources, if a choice has to be made between the two, sometimes preserving wickets at the expense of scoring runs ('conservative' batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2's target, and sometimes the reverse ('aggressive' batting) is true.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || 30.8 || 28.3 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 22.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nFor example, suppose Team 1 has been batting without interruptions, but thinks the innings will be cut short at 40 overs, i.e. with 10 overs left. (Then Team 2 will have 40 overs to bat, so Team 2's resource will be 89.3%.) Team 1 thinks by batting conservatively it can reach 200\u20136, or by batting aggressively it can reach 220\u20138:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 22.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 11.4%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 22.8% = 77.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 11.4% = 88.6%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 77.2%) <br />= '''230.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 88.6%) <br />= '''221.75 runs'''\n|}\n\nTherefore, in this case, the conservative strategy achieves a higher target for Team 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 30.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 28.3 || 22.8 || 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nHowever, suppose instead that the difference between the two strategies is scoring 200\u20132 or 220\u20134:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 30.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 28.3%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 30.8% = 69.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 28.3% = 71.7%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 69.2%) <br />= '''250.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 71.7%) <br />= '''264.00 runs'''\n|}\n\nIn this case, the aggressive strategy is better.\n\nTherefore, the best batting strategy for Team 1 ahead of a coming interruption is not always the same, but varies with the [[facts]] of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the [[opinions]] about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last \u2013 will Team 1's innings be restarted?).\n\nThis example shows just two possible batting strategies, but in reality there could be a range of others, e.g. 'neutral', 'semi-aggressive', 'super-aggressive', or [[timewasting]] to minimise the amount of resource used by slowing the over rate. Finding which strategy is the best can only be found by inputting the facts and one's opinions into the calculations and seeing what emerges.\n\nOf course, a chosen strategy may backfire. For example, if Team 1 chooses to bat conservatively, Team 2 may see this and decide to attack (rather than focus on saving runs), and Team 1 may both fail to score many more runs ''and'' lose wickets.\n\nIf there have already been interruptions to Team 1's innings, the calculation of total resource they use will be more complicated than this example.\n\n====Strategy for team 2====\nDuring Team 1's innings, Team 2's objective is to minimise the target score they will be set. This is achieved by minimising Team 1's score, or (as above), if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, alternatively by maximising the resource used by Team 1 (i.e. wickets lost or overs bowled) before that happens. Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try and achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, inputting their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.\n\nAlso, Team 2 can encourage Team 1 to bat particularly conservatively or aggressively (e.g. through [[Fielding (cricket)#Tactics of field placement|field settings]]).\n\n===During team 2's innings===\nA target (from a given number of overs) is set for Team 2 at the start of its innings. If there will not be any future interruptions, then both sides can play to a finish in the normal way. However, if there are likely to be interruptions to Team 2's innings, then Team 2 will aim to keep itself ahead of the D/L par score, and Team 1 will aim to keep them behind it. This is because, if a match is abandoned before the given number of overs is complete, Team 2 is declared the winner if they're ahead of the par score, and Team 1 is declared the winner if Team 2 are behind the par score. A tie is declared if Team 2 are exactly on the par score. (This is provided a minimum number of overs has been bowled in Team 2's innings.)\n\nThe par score increases with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, as the amount of resource used increases. As an example, in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup Final]] Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India's par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource used to that point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% &minus; 85.3% = 14.7% had been used. India's par score after 9 overs was therefore 359 x 14.7%/100% = 52.773, which is rounded down to 52.\n\nDuring the six balls of the 10th over India scored 0, 0, 0, 1 (from a no ball), loss of wicket, 0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC2003/SCORECARDS/FINALS/AUS_IND_WC2003_ODI-FINAL_23MAR2003_BBB-COMMS.html|title=Final: Australia v India at Johannesburg Ball-by-Ball Commentary|date=23 March 2003|work=Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media}}</ref> At the start of the over India were ahead of the par score, but the loss of the wicket caused their par score to jump from 55 to 79, which put them behind the par score.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs used\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" colspan=\"4\" width=\"100pt\" | 1 wicket lost\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 2 wickets lost\n! style=\"border-style:solid;border-color:white;\" rowspan=\"9\" width=\"50pt\" | \n! style=\"border-width:0 0 0 3px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background:#ffdead;\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" | India's actual score\n|-\n| width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources remaining''' || width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''Resources used (R2)''' || width=\"100pt\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | '''D/L par score''' \n|-\n| 9.0 || 85.3% || 14.7% || width=\"60pt\" | 52.773 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" width=\"40pt\" | 52 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.7% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.3% || width=\"60pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76.467 || width=\"40pt\" style=\"color:grey;\" | 76 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.1 || 85.1% || 14.9% || 53.491 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 53 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.5% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.185 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.2 || 84.9% || 15.1% || 54.209 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77.544 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 77 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.3 || 84.7% || 15.3% || 54.927 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 54 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.262 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 57-1\n|-\n| 9.4 || 84.6% || 15.4% || 55.286 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 55 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.1% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 21.9% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78.621 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 78 || 58-1\n|-\n| 9.5 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.4% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.6% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.004 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.9% || 22.1% || 79.339 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|-\n| 10.0 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 84.2% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 15.8% || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56.722 || style=\"color:grey;\" | 56 || 77.8% || 22.2% || 79.698 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 79 || 58-2\n|}\n\n==Other uses==\n\nThere are uses of the D/L method other than finding the current official final target score for the team batting second in a match that has already been reduced by the weather.\n\n===Ball-by-ball par score===\n\n[[File:Lords scoreboard.jpg|thumb|300px|Scoreboard showing ball-by-ball D/L Par Score.]]\n\n[[File:2015 CWC I v UAE 02-28 Scoreboard (02).JPG|thumb|Many stadium scoreboards do not carry information about par scores during games]]\n\nDuring the second team's innings, the number of runs a chasing side would expect to have scored on average with this number of overs used and wickets lost, if they were going to successfully match the first team's score, called the D/L par score, may be shown on a computer printout, the scoreboard and/or TV alongside the actual score, and updated after every ball.

The DLS method is an attempt to set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.\n\n==History and creation==\nVarious different methods had been used previously to resolve rain-affected cricket games, with the most common being the [[Average Run Rate method]] and the [[Most Productive Overs method]]. \n\nThese earlier methods, while simple in nature, had intrinsic flaws that meant they produced unfair revised targets that altered the balance of the match, and were easily exploitable:\n* The Average Run Rate method took no account of how many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply reflected how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So, if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. \n* The Most Productive Overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalised the team batting second for good bowling by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.\n\n[[File:India Vs New zealand One day International, 10 December 2010 (6159936713).jpg|thumb|D/L began in [[one-day international]]s]]\n\nThe D/L method was devised by two British [[statistician]]s, [[Frank Duckworth]] and [[Tony Lewis (mathematician)|Tony Lewis]], as a result of the outcome to the semi-final in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]] between England and South Africa, where the ''Most Productive Overs'' method was used. Rain stopped play for 12 minutes with [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] needing 22 runs from 13 balls.

Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to score as many runs as possible: the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s they have to receive; and the number of [[Dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] they have in hand. At any point in any [[innings]], a team's ability to score more runs depends on the combination of these two resources they have left. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daa.com.au/analytical-ideas/cricket/|title=The Duckworth-Lewis Method|publisher=Data Analysis Australia|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:(Duckworth Lewis) method of adjusting target scores.PNG|thumb|300px|A published table of resource remaining percentages, for all combinations of wickets lost and whole overs left]]\n\nThe D/L method converts all possible combinations of overs (or, more accurately, balls) and wickets left into a combined resources remaining [[percentage]] figure (with 50 overs and 10 wickets = 100%), and these are all stored in a published table or computer. The target score for the team batting second ('Team 2') can be adjusted up or down from the total the team batting first ('Team 1') achieved using these resource percentages, to reflect the loss of resources to one or both teams when a match is shortened one or more times.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches (the 'Professional Edition'), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the two teams' resources, i.e.\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nIf, as usually occurs, this 'par score' is a non-[[integer]] number of runs, then Team 2's target to win is this number rounded up to the next integer, and the score to [[The result in cricket#Tie|tie]] (also called the par score), is this number rounded down to the preceding integer. If Team 2 reaches or passes the target score, then they have won the match. If the match ends when Team 2 has exactly met (but not passed) the par score then the match is a tie. If Team 2 fail to reach the par score then they have lost.\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 90% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 254 with 100% of resources available, then 254&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;90%&nbsp;/&nbsp;100%&nbsp;=&nbsp;228.6, so Team 2's target is 229, and the score to tie is 228. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DL_FAQ.html|title=D/L method: answers to frequently asked questions|author1=Frank Duckworth|author2=Tony Lewis|work=Crickinfo|publisher=ESPN Sports Media|date=December 2008}}</ref> so a computer which has this software loaded must be used.\n\nIf it is a 50-over match and Team 1 completed its innings uninterrupted, then they had 100% resource available to them, so the formula simplifies to:\n\n: <math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\text{Team 2's resources}. </math>\n\n===Summary of impact on Team 2's target===\n*If there is a delay before the first innings starts, so that the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced but still the same as each other, then D/L makes no change to the target score, because both sides are aware of the total number of overs and wickets throughout their innings, thus they will have the same resources available.\n*Team 2's target score is first calculated once Team 1's innings has finished.\n*If there were interruption(s) during Team 1's innings, or Team 1's innings was cut short, so the numbers of overs in the two innings are reduced (but still the same as each other), then D/L will adjust Team 2's target score as described above. The adjustment to Team 2's target after interruptions in Team 1's innings is often an increase, implying that Team 2 has more resource available than Team 1 had. Although both teams have 10 wickets and the same (reduced) number of overs available, an increase is fair as, for some of their innings, Team 1 ''thought'' they would have more overs available than they actually ended up having. If Team 1 had known that their innings was going to be shorter, they would have batted less conservatively, and scored more runs (at the expense of more wickets). They saved some wicket resource to use up in the overs that ended up being cancelled, which Team 2 does not need to do, therefore Team 2 ''does'' have more resource to use in the same number of overs. Therefore, increasing Team 2's target score compensates Team 1 for the denial of some of the overs they thought they would get to bat. The increased target is what D/L thinks Team 1 would have scored in the overs it ended up having, if it had known throughout that the innings would be only as long as it was.\n:For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, thinking they would have 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly be unfair to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.\n*If there are interruption(s) to Team 2's innings, either before it starts, during, or it is cut short, then D/L will reduce Team 2's target score from the initial target set at the end of Team 1's innings, in proportion to the reduction in Team 2's resources. If there are multiple interruptions in the second innings, the target will be adjusted downwards each time.\n*If there are interruptions which both increase and decrease the target score, then the net effect on the target could be either an increase or decrease, depending on which interruptions were bigger.\n\n===Mathematical theory===\nThe original D/L model started by assuming that the number of runs that can still be scored (called <math>Z</math>), for a given number of overs remaining (called <math>u</math>) and wickets lost (called <math>w</math>), takes the following [[exponential decay]] relationship:<ref name=OrigPaper>{{Cite journal |last1=Duckworth |first1=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=1998 |title=A fair method for resetting the target in interrupted one-day cricket matches |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=220\u2013227 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600524 |citeseerx=10.1.1.180.3272 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>Z(u,w) = Z_0(w)\\left({1 - e^{-b(w)u} } \\right),</math>\n\nwhere the constant <math>Z_0</math> is the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] average total score in unlimited overs (under one-day rules), and <math>b</math> is the exponential decay constant.

When it was introduced, it was necessary that D/L could be implemented with a single table of\nresource percentages, as it could not be guaranteed that computers would be present. Therefore, this single formula was used giving average resources. This method relies on the assumption that average performance is proportional to the mean, irrespective of the actual score. This was good enough in 95 per cent of matches, but in the 5 per cent of matches with very high scores, the simple approach started to break down.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=Frank |year=2008 |title=The Duckworth/Lewis method: an exercise in Maths, Stats, OR and communications |journal=MSOR Connections |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=11\u201314 |url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/msor.8.3d.pdf |publisher=HE Academy|doi=10.11120/msor.2008.08030011 }}</ref> To overcome the problem, an upgraded formula was proposed with an additional parameter whose value depends on the Team 1 innings.<ref name=SecondPaper>{{Cite journal |last=Duckworth |first=FC |last2=Lewis|first2= AJ |year=2004 |title=A successful Operational Research intervention in one-day cricket |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=749\u2013759 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601717 |pmid= |bibcode= |ref=}}</ref> This became the Professional Edition.\n\n==Examples==\n===Stoppage in first innings===\n====Increased target====\nIn the 4th [[Indian Cricket Team|India]] \u2013 [[England cricket team|England]] ODI in the 2008 series, the first innings was interrupted by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each.

As England ''knew'' they had only 22 overs the expectation is that they will be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings.

Pakistan, batting second, were 311/7 when bad light stopped play after the 47th over. Pakistan's target, had the match continued, was 18 runs in 18 balls, with three wickets in hand. Considering the overall scoring rate throughout the match, this is a target most teams would be favoured to achieve. And indeed, application of the D/L method resulted in a retrospective target score of 305 (or par score of 304) at the end of the 47th over, with the result therefore officially listed as \"Pakistan won by 7 runs (D/L Method)\".\n\nThe D/L method was used in the group stage match between [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] at the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20#Group B|20/20 World Cup in 2010]]. Sri Lanka scored 173/7 in 20 overs batting first, and in reply Zimbabwe were 4/0 from 1 over when rain interrupted play. At the restart Zimbabwe's target was reduced to 108 from 12 overs, but rain stopped the match when they had scored 29/1 from 5 overs.

This match was frequently interrupted by rain in the final overs, and a ball-by-ball calculation of the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score played a key role in tactical decisions during those overs. At one point, India were leading under D/L during one rain delay, and would have won if play had not resumed. At a second rain interval, England, who had scored some quick runs (knowing they needed to get ahead in D/L terms) would correspondingly have won if play had not resumed. Play was finally called off with just 7 balls of the match remaining and England's score equal to the Duckworth\u2013Lewis 'par' score, therefore resulting in a tie.\n\nThis example does show how crucial (and difficult) the decisions of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is heavy enough to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a [[dot ball]] \u2013 indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.\n\n===Stoppages in both innings===\nDuring the [[2012\u201313 Big Bash League season#Knockout stage 2|2012/13 KFC Big Bash League]], D/L was used in the 2nd semi-final played between the [[Melbourne Stars]] and the [[Perth Scorchers]].

Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required.<ref name=FAQ/> Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.\n\nIn 2002 the resource percentages were revised, following an extensive analysis of limited overs matches, and there was a change to the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis method#Step 2. Convert the two teams.27 batting resources into Team 2.27s target score|G50]] for ODIs. (G50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match.)

Find the batting resources available to each team===\n\nAfter each reduction in overs, the new total batting resources available to the two teams are found, using figures for the total amount of batting resources ''remaining'' for any combination of overs and wickets. While the process for converting these resources remaining figures into total resource available figures is the same in the two Editions, this can be done manually in the Standard Edition, as the resource remaining figures are published in a reference table.<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/> However, the resource remaining figures used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available,<ref name=FAQ/> so a computer must be used which has the software loaded.\n\n*If a team loses resource at the ''start'' of an innings (left hand image below), then this is simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is the resource available.\n*If a team loses resource at the ''end'' of its innings (centre image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and [[subtraction|subtracting]] the resources remaining at the point the innings was ended. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but its innings is ended with 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 52.4% = 47.6%.\n*If a team loses resource in the ''middle'' of its innings (right hand image below), then the resource that was available to that team is found by taking the resources it had at the start, and subtracting the resources remaining at the point the innings was interrupted (to give the resources used in the first period of the innings), then adding on the resource remaining at the restart. For example, if a team starts with 50 overs and 10 wickets (100% of its resources), but is interrupted when it still has 40 overs and 8 wickets remaining (77.8% of its resources), and restarted when it has 20 overs and 8 wickets remaining (52.4% of its resources), then the resources it actually used is 100% &minus; 77.8% + 52.4% = 74.6%. Another way of looking at this is to say it lost the resources available between 40 overs and 8 wickets (77.8%) and 20 overs and 8 wickets (52.4%), i.e. 77.8% &minus; 52.4% = 25.4%, so its total resource available was 100% &minus; 25.4% = 74.6%.\n\n'''[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag1.png|300px|DuckworthLewisDiag1]]''' \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag2.png|330px|DuckworthLewisDiag2]] \n[[File:DuckworthLewisDiag3.png|360px|DuckworthLewisDiag3]]\n\nThese are just the different ways of having one interruption. With multiple interruptions possible, it may seem like finding the total resource percentage requires a different calculation for each different scenario. However, the formula is actually the same each time &minus; it's just that different scenarios, with more or less interruptions and restarts, need to use more or less of the same formula. The total resources available to a team are given by:<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nwhich can alternatively be written as:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nEach time there's an interruption or a restart after an interruption, the resource remaining percentages at those times (obtained from a reference table for the Standard Edition, or from a computer for the Professional Edition) can be entered into the formula, with the rest left blank. Note that a delay at the start of an innings counts as the 1st interruption.\n\n===Step 2. Convert the two teams' batting resources into Team 2's target score===\n\n'''Standard Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score by the extra runs that could be expected to be scored on average with the extra total resource, i.e. '''S&nbsp;+&nbsp;G50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(R2&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;R1)/100''', where G50 is the average 50-over total. Team 2's target score is not simply increased in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1, as this 'could lead to some unrealistically high targets if Team 1 had achieved an early high rate of scoring [in the [[Powerplay (cricket)|powerplay]] overs] and rain caused a drastic reduction in the overs for the match.'<ref name=FAQ/> Instead, D/L Standard Edition requires average performance for Team 2's additional resource over Team 1.\n\n'''G50'''\n\nG50 is the average score expected from the team batting first in an uninterrupted 50 overs-per-innings match. This will vary with the level of competition and over time.

In fact it would be possible for the two captains to agree a value of G50 before the start of each match, taking account of all relevant factors. However, we do not believe that something that is only invoked if rain interferes with the game should impose itself on every game in this way. In any case, it should be realised that the value of G50 usually has very little effect on the revised target. If 250 were used, for instance, instead of 235, it is unlikely that the target would be more than two or three runs different.'<ref name=FAQ/>\n\n'''Professional Edition'''\n\n*If R2&nbsp;<&nbsp;R1, reduce Team 2's target score in proportion to the reduction in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.\n*If R2&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1, no adjustment to Team 2's target score is needed.\n*If R2&nbsp;>&nbsp;R1, increase Team 2's target score in proportion to the increase in total resources, i.e. '''S&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;R2/R1'''.

It is fair that their target was increased, even though they had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralises the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 &minus; 122 = 75 runs.\n\nThis formula for Netherlands' par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2>R1. The formula required Netherlands to match Australia's performance with their overlapping 72.6% of resource (i.e. score 170 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 84.1% &minus; 72.6% = 11.5% of resource (i.e. score 11.5% of G50 (235 at the time) = 27.025 runs).\n\nAfter the match there were reports in the media<ref name=\"AusNedReport\"/> that Australia had batted conservatively in their final 8 overs after the final restart, to avoid losing wickets rather than maximising their numbers of runs, in belief that this would further increase the Netherlands' par score. However, if this is true, this belief was mistaken, in the same way that conserving wickets rather than maximising runs in the final 8 overs of a full 50-over innings would be a mistake. At that point the amount of resource available to each team was fixed (as long as there were no further rain interruptions), so the only undetermined number in the formula for Netherlands' par score was Australia's final score, so they should have tried to maximise this.\n\nAs Australia's innings was interrupted three times (once before it started) and restarted three times, their resource is given by the general formula above as follows:\n\nTotal resources available = 100% &minus; Resources remaining at 1st interruption + Resources remaining at 1st restart &minus; Resources remaining at 2nd interruption + Resources remaining at 2nd restart &minus; Resources remaining at 3rd interruption + Resources remaining at 3rd restart = 100% &minus; 100% + 97.1% &minus; 55.8% + 50.5% &minus; 44.7% + 25.5% = 72.6%.\n\n==In-game strategy==\n===During team 1's innings===\n====Strategy for team 1====\nDuring Team 1's innings, the target score calculations (as described above), have not yet been made.\n\nThe objective of the team batting first is to maximise the target score which will be calculated for the team batting second, which (in the Professional Edition) will be determined by the formula:\n\n<math>\\text{Team 2's par score }=\\text{ Team 1's score} \\times \\frac{\\text{Team 2's resources}}{\\text{Team 1's resources}}.</math>\n\nFor these three terms:\n*'''Team 1's score''': Team 1 will always increase Team 2's target by increasing their own score. \n*At the start of Team 2's innings, '''Team 2's resources''' will be 10 wickets and the number of overs available, and Team 1 cannot affect this.\n*'''Team 1's resources''' are given by:\n\n<!--<div style=\"background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 2px;\">-->\n<div style=\"background: white; border: 2px solid rgb(0, 255, 0); padding: 2px;\">\n{|\n|-\n|Total resources available = 100% &minus; Resources lost by 1st interruption &minus; Resources lost by 2nd interruption &minus; Resources lost by 3rd interruption &minus; ...\n|}\n</div>\n\nIf there will not be any future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then the amount of resource available to them is now fixed (whether there have been interruptions so far or not), so the only thing Team 1 can do to increase Team 2's target is increase their own score, ignoring how many wickets they lose (as in a normal unaffected match).\n\nHowever, if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, then an alternative strategy to scoring more runs is minimising the amount of resource they use before the coming interruption (i.e. preserving wickets). While the best overall strategy is obviously to both score more runs ''and'' preserve resources, if a choice has to be made between the two, sometimes preserving wickets at the expense of scoring runs ('conservative' batting) is a more effective way of increasing Team 2's target, and sometimes the reverse ('aggressive' batting) is true.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || 30.8 || 28.3 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 22.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nFor example, suppose Team 1 has been batting without interruptions, but thinks the innings will be cut short at 40 overs, i.e. with 10 overs left. (Then Team 2 will have 40 overs to bat, so Team 2's resource will be 89.3%.) Team 1 thinks by batting conservatively it can reach 200\u20136, or by batting aggressively it can reach 220\u20138:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 4\n| align=\"center\" | 2\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 22.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 11.4%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 22.8% = 77.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 11.4% = 88.6%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 77.2%) <br />= '''230.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 88.6%) <br />= '''221.75 runs'''\n|}\n\nTherefore, in this case, the conservative strategy achieves a higher target for Team 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center; width:25%;\"\n|+ Percentage total resources remaining reference table (D/L Standard Edition)<ref name=\"DLMethod\"/>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Overs remaining\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Wickets in hand\n|-\n| '''10''' || '''8''' || '''6''' || '''4''' || '''2''' \n|-\n| '''50''' || 100.0 || 85.1 || 62.7 || 34.9 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''40''' || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 89.3 || 77.8 || 59.5 || 34.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''30''' || 75.1 || 67.3 || 54.1 || 33.6 || 11.9\n|-\n| '''20''' || 56.6 || 52.4 || 44.6 || 30.8 || 11.9 \n|-\n| '''10''' || 32.1 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 30.8 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 28.3 || 22.8 || 11.4 \n|-\n| '''5''' || 17.2 || 16.8 || 16.1 || 14.3 || 9.4 \n|}\n\nHowever, suppose instead that the difference between the two strategies is scoring 200\u20132 or 220\u20134:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Batting strategy\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Conservative\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Aggressive\n|-\n| Runs Team 1 thinks it can score\n| align=\"center\" | 200\n| align=\"center\" | 220 \n|-\n| Wickets Team 1 thinks it will have in hand\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n|-\n| Resource remaining to Team 1 at cut-off\n| align=\"center\" | 30.8%\n| align=\"center\" | 28.3%\n|-\n| Resource used by Team 1\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 30.8% = 69.2%\n| align=\"center\" | 100% &minus; 28.3% = 71.7%\n|-\n| Team 2's par score\n| align=\"center\" | 200 + 250 x (89.3% - 69.2%) <br />= '''250.25 runs'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | 220 + 250 x (89.3% - 71.7%) <br />= '''264.00 runs'''\n|}\n\nIn this case, the aggressive strategy is better.\n\nTherefore, the best batting strategy for Team 1 ahead of a coming interruption is not always the same, but varies with the [[facts]] of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets lost, overs used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the [[opinions]] about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be lost, and further overs will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last \u2013 will Team 1's innings be restarted?).\n\nThis example shows just two possible batting strategies, but in reality there could be a range of others, e.g. 'neutral', 'semi-aggressive', 'super-aggressive', or [[timewasting]] to minimise the amount of resource used by slowing the over rate. Finding which strategy is the best can only be found by inputting the facts and one's opinions into the calculations and seeing what emerges.\n\nOf course, a chosen strategy may backfire. For example, if Team 1 chooses to bat conservatively, Team 2 may see this and decide to attack (rather than focus on saving runs), and Team 1 may both fail to score many more runs ''and'' lose wickets.\n\nIf there have already been interruptions to Team 1's innings, the calculation of total resource they use will be more complicated than this example.\n\n====Strategy for team 2====\nDuring Team 1's innings, Team 2's objective is to minimise the target score they will be set. This is achieved by minimising Team 1's score, or (as above), if there will be future interruptions to Team 1's innings, alternatively by maximising the resource used by Team 1 (i.e. wickets lost or overs bowled) before that happens. Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try and achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, inputting their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.\n\nAlso, Team 2 can encourage Team 1 to bat particularly conservatively or aggressively (e.g. through [[Fielding (cricket)#Tactics of field placement|field settings]]).\n\n===During team 2's innings===\nA target (from a given number of overs) is set for Team 2 at the start of its innings. If there will not be any future interruptions, then both sides can play to a finish in the normal way. However, if there are likely to be interruptions to Team 2's innings, then Team 2 will aim to keep itself ahead of the D/L par score, and Team 1 will aim to keep them behind it. This is because, if a match is abandoned before the given number of overs is complete, Team 2 is declared the winner if they're ahead of the par score, and Team 1 is declared the winner if Team 2 are behind the par score. A tie is declared if Team 2 are exactly on the par score. (This is provided a minimum number of overs has been bowled in Team 2's innings.)\n\nThe par score increases with every ball bowled and every wicket lost, as the amount of resource used increases. As an example, in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup Final]] Australia batted first and scored 359 from 50 overs. As Australia completed their 50 overs, their total resources used R1=100%, so India's par score throughout their innings was: 359 x R2/100%, where R2 is the amount of resource used to that point. As shown in the first line of the table below, after 9 overs India were 57-1, and 41 overs and 9 wickets remaining equates to 85.3% of resources, so 100% &minus; 85.3% = 14.7% had been used.

In 1985 a 16 hectare section of the southern part of Goanna Headland became the first aboriginal land grant in New South Wales. This grant was made to the [[Bogal, Jali and Ngulingah Land Councils]]. The major part of Goanna Headland is now a reserve which is managed for the wider community by the [[Dirawong Trust]]. The objectives are to conserve aboriginal culture and heritage, preserve the native flora and fauna and provide recreational activities to the public.\n\nGoanna Headland, located at [[Evans Head, New South Wales|Evans Head]] in [[New South Wales]], is one of the most easterly points on mainland Australia, and the town where [[Queen Elizabeth II]] flew into during her Royal visit to Australia in 1954. The Headland is believed by Bundjalung Nation Aborigines to be the body of the mythical Dirawong. When viewed from above, the headland has a rough outline showing the shape of a goanna, within which the spirit creature is believed to exist even today.\n\nGoanna Headland has been the mythological place of origin of the Bundjalung Nation, for thousands of years. The Bundjalung Nation people represented by 15 [[Australian Aboriginal tribes]], within which are many groups, clans and bands) call the spiritual creature \"The Dirawong\" (goanna). It is the spiritual centre of their culture. Within its landscape are many sacred, secret, and ceremonial sites. To date some 24 [[archaeological sites]] have been located on Goanna Headland to the south of Evans Head Village. Nine sites have also been identified within the [[Broadwater National Park]], which are of aboriginal cultural significance.\n\n==Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal Dreamtime Stories - Myths & Legends==\n\nWe can count ourselves fortunate that some of the ancient Aboriginal languages and\ndreaming tales of the Northern Rivers region and South East Queensland have survived. In just 200 years, and after thousands of years of habitation, the last speakers of the original tongues of this region were all but wiped out. Their sacred land as well as hunting grounds were involuntarily turned into someone else's property. So much has been lost.\n\n===Bundjalung Nation Creation Myth - The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime===\n\n[[Image:Snake Island Dirawong 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Snake Island in the middle of the river, on the right is Pelican Island and in the background is the Dirawong. (2010).]]Since there are numerous versions of the myth, what is in this instance reported is a summarised version, which lacks crucial details essential for the understanding of the myth\n\nIn translating creation myths into English and in using another version instead of the Bundjalung nation Aboriginal dream time story, Europeans have obscured the wisdom passed down from the Australian Aborigines from generation to generation. The creation myth or story is but one aspect of the whole and must be linked with the sacred place, sacred song and sacred ceremony known only to the most knowledgeable initiated elders of each tribe\n\nBundjalung Nation [[oral literature]] [[tradition]] tells the story about a fight between the Dirawong and the Rainbow Snake, that caused the creation of the Bungawalbin River, the Evans River, Pelican Island, Snake Island, other islands in the Evans River, and also an \"island (Rainbow Snake)\" at an unknown geographic location in the Pacific Ocean, and possibly the hill now known as \"Goanna Headland (Dirawong)\"\n\nAccording to the legend, the Rainbow Snake had been very bad. What he did is a secret, and cannot be revealed here, but it was so bad that a [[Weeum]] (known as a 'Clever Man', 'Man of high degree of initiation' or 'Man with great powers') named Nyimbunji from the area known as [[Bungawalbin]], called on the Dirawong (or Goanna) to help protect a Yabbra (or Bird) from the Rainbow Snake (or [[Waugal]])\n\nOnly Dirawong was powerful enough to deal with Rainbow Snake. Dirawong chased Rainbow Snake from inland eastward towards the coast and as they went they formed parts of the [[Richmond River]]. At Maniworkan (or the town of [[Woodburn, New South Wales]], Australia) they left the Richmond River and kept on going east. Halfway down the [[Evans River (New South Wales)|Evans River]], Dirawong caught Rainbow Snake, the Snake turned around and bit Goanna on the head, Dirawong then withdrew from the battle in order to eat some [[herbs]] to recover ([[Healing|heal]]) from the [[snakebite]], when he felt better from the snakebite he resumed his chase\n\nMeanwhile, Rainbow Snake had reached Evans Head. Rainbow Snake looked around. Dirawong was nowhere to be seen, so Rainbow Snake decided to go back west. The Rainbow Snake then went into the Evans River and coiled itself around and created Snake Island. As he turned his body made another larger island in the river, now known as [[Pelican Island (New South Wales)|Pelican Island]]\n\nWhen Rainbow Snake spotted Dirawong heading towards him, Rainbow Snake quickly turned, and this time Rainbow Snake kept going until he reached the Burraga ([[Tasman Sea]], [[Pacific Ocean]]), and made himself into an [[Island]] so Dirawong wouldn't recognise Rainbow Snake\n\nDirawong reached the coast at Evans Head. Dirawong then laid down next to the coast, facing the Burraga, waiting for Rainbow Snake to come back. And you can still hear Rainbow Snake and see Goanna, today at Evans Head. The patch of '[[red ochre]]' on top of Goanna Headland shows the wound where the Rainbow Snake bit the Goanna in the dream time <ref>[http://www.nimbinweb.com.au/bundjalung/index.htm The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime]</ref>\n\n====Interpretation of the Creation Myth - The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime====\n\nThe creation was believed to be the work of culture heroes that in the creative epoch traveled across a formless land, creating sacred sites and significant places of interest in their travels. In this way songlines were established, some of which could travel right across Australia, through as many as six to ten different language groupings. The songs and dances of a particular songline were kept alive and frequently performed at large gatherings, organised in good seasons.<ref>[[Dreamtime]]</ref>\n\n====Various Bundjalung nation Aboriginal tribes Legends about 'The Three Brothers'====\n\n=====Bundjalung nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 1=====\nA Bundjalung nation Aboriginal dream time legend tells of three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, their mother and wives who landed at Gummingarr (which is now called [[Chinamens Beach]] at [[Evans Head]], New South Wales, Australia) in canoes (made from the bark of a [[Moreton Bay Pine]] ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]])). While the three brothers repaired one of their canoes, their mother went to look for food. When it was time to leave the three brothers could not find their mother so left without her. On her return she found her three sons had left without her, enraged at being left behind, she called out to the three brothers and in her anger struck the sea with a stick. This caused the first big waves on the sea and caused the three brothers canoe to sink on a reef at the mouth of the Richmond River, and the three brothers then swam ashore at the historical geographical location known as 'Shelley Beach', located at [[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]], New South Wales, Australia (the area was called in Bundjalung language 'Bullinah', meaning place of many oysters in Njangbal language). The three brothers returned overland to find their mother and stayed to settle this country. One brother went south, another west and the third brother north. In doing so the three brothers founded the tribal groups of the Bundjalung Nation.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 2=====\nThis Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend tells of three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, who are said to have come from the sea. The brothers, along with their grandmother, arrived in a canoe made from the bark of a hoop pine. As they followed the coastline, they found a rich land sparsely populated, so they landed at the mouth of the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence river]], where the towns of [[Iluka, New South Wales|Iluka]] and [[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]] now stand, and stayed there for a long time, then, leaving their grandmother behind they continued on in their canoe heading up the east coast. At one place they landed and created a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] of fresh water. They stopped along the coast at various places and populated the land. 'The Three Brothers' also made the laws for the Bundjalung Nation people and also the ceremonies of the [[Bora (Australian)|Bora rings]]. The Bora Ring was the meeting place where stories were handed down. That's where the laws came from for all the tribes. The Elders got together and passed down the laws to the younger men of the tribes.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 3=====\nAccording to Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal dream-time, three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, settled on what is now known as Seven Mile beach (between Lennox Head and Broken Head) and one of them, Yarbirri, produced a flow of fresh water by thrusting his spear into the sand. At low tide there is said to be a stain marking the spot from where the water flowed.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Yaegle tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 4=====\nIn the very beginning, three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, together with their wives and mother traveled from far across the sea, arriving on the Australian coast at the mouth of the Clarence River. Their boat, however, was blown out to sea in a storm, so 'The Three Brothers' decided to build canoes in order to return to their homeland far across the sea.\n\nThey completed building the canoes but could find no sign of their mother anywhere so they set off without her. On returning to find she had been left behind, the mother climbed to the top of a hill and cursed them for abandoning her. She called the ocean to anger and the wild seas forced 'The Three Brothers' back to land at Chinamans Beach, near Evans Head. Once the seas had abated one of 'The Three Brothers' returned south to find their mother. The others settled near Evans Head, developed families and a thriving community.\n\nOne of the families moved north, another west and the third to the south, forming the three branches of the bundjalung people.<ref name=\"planetcorroboree\">[http://www.planetcorroboree.com.au/index.php?pr=Message_Stick Planet Corroboree]</ref>\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Yaegle tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 5=====\nAccording to Bundjalung Legend, The Founding Three Brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, made one of their famous landings at what is now Lennox Head said to be near today a group of black rocks on the beach. When the eldest of 'The Three Brothers' Yarbirri, thrust a spear into the sand, fresh water ran ([[Lake Ainsworth]]) and it is said when the tide is low you can still see a rusty stain. After their landing at Lennox Head, the Three Brothers moved north towards [[Brunswick Heads]], where they created the first Bora ground. Thousands of years later, a bora ground remains at Lennox Head, protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is open to the public.<ref name=\"planetcorroboree\"/>\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Ngybul tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 6=====\n\"The coastal areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland were associated with the legend of the THREE BROTHERS the ancestors of the Aboriginal people who came from the sea and landed on the east coast. The details of the legend vary from one part of the coast to another, each Aboriginal language area claiming that the brothers landed in their territory.\n\nIn the Northern Rivers area the legend states that the three brothers made their first landing at Yamba or illuka, and after three subsequent landings further north, one at Evans Head, then Ballina and the last at the Lennox boat channel area at Lennox Head, two of the brothers then occupied the coast, while the third moved inland and occupied the Lismore district.\n\nEvans Head was known as Gummingarr, a name derived from gummi, meaning father's mother. This recalls an incident in the legend where the grandmother of the three brothers went into the bush to gather fern roots; she could not be found when the three brothers prepared to paddle northward, and was therefore was left behind. Arriving back at the beach the grandmother grew very angry at being left behind and used her magic to summon up a storm making the first waves on what up till that point had been a waveless ocean. This forced the brothers ashore at Ballina and they went overland back to retrieve the grandmother.\n\nThe next landing was at Lennox Head in the boat channel area (bream hole/moat) of the beach. One of the brothers, named Yarbirri (his beard was a dark red colour), thrust his hunting spear into the sand, and fresh water gushed out. Before the swampy area in the southern corner was filled and drained a ti-tree coloured stain was often seen that resembled a red beard.\n\nAfter Lennox the brothers continued north to their final landing at Brunswick Heads, where they are said to have made the first wandaral or bora ring. Be that as it may, there is a well preserved bora ring in Lennox. It is situated ninety metres west of Gibbon Street and is also adjacent to the Megan Crescent cricket field. It is fenced and maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of NSW and is open to visitors. The Bora Ring was used mainly for male initiation ceremonies.\n\nAfter the first Wandaral ceremony at Brunswick, The eldest brother, Yarbirri, made the laws. The brothers decided to separate and to populate the earth, Yarbirri went north, Mamoon to the west and Birrung to the south. The name Birin (Birrung) was widely used to mean \"southerners\"; the people north of the Brisbane River regarded all of the Bunjalung people as Birin: to the people of the Byron Bay area Birin referred to the people of the Clarence.\"\n\n====Legend of 'Mount Bugerum Boogerum'====\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Ngybul tribe - Story 1=====\nAccording to a Bundjalung Legend, Mount Bugerum Boogerum was of enormous spiritual significance to local Aboriginal people. It was said that the eldest of The Founding Three Brothers, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain'), was known to have been spoken to by God on Mount Bugerum Boogerum, that at least is the belief, and the belief has drawn pilgrims for thousands of years. There is not a great deal of evidence but it is Bundjalung Nation oral history.<ref>[http://www.echo.net.au/archives/21_15-02.html Echo]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Bundjalung Legends about Spirits of The Forest====\n\n=====Legend of the Wiangaree Lagoon=====\nIn ancient times, long before white people came to this country, Aboriginal people living in the area now known as the Upper Richmond River District believed that a lagoon at Wiangaree was haunted by the ghostly spirit of a woman.\n\nOne day a warrior from a tribe living near the lagoon came back to the camp tired from hunting. He was angry when he found that his wife was not there to meet him, as were the wives of the other warriors. The warrior was jealous and thought immediately that his wife was being unfaithful. He went looking for her and became more and more angry with every step he took. When he found her walking in the bush, quite unaware that her husband had returned, he accused her of being unfaithful. Against her determined protests of innocence and her struggles, he drowned her in the lagoon.\n\nIt was said that from time to time the sound of her body struggling in the lagoon could be heard, as could her cries as she sank beneath the surface. The warriors, an ancient people, continue to live there in spirit. And what of the spirit of the woman? Is it the sound of her body splashing in the lagoon or...only a platypus? Are they her death cries one can hear or...merely those of a night bird?\nWho can tell? It was so long ago.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal Story about the Dirawong Tribe Massacre at Evans Head=====\n\nIn the 1840s, Goanna Headland located at Evans Head, was the site of a massacre of Bundjalung people by Europeans.<ref name=\"woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au\">[http://woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au/history.htm History - Aboriginal - Local Tribes - Bundjalung People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024121116/http://woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au/history.htm |date=2009-10-24 }}</ref> Today, people from all over the world still speak of hearing spiritual voices on the hill around the old campsite in Bundjalung National Park late in the afternoons, and local fishermen have spoken of lights on the Evans River at night. Aboriginal legend says that the lights are from fire sticks.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of a historical and spiritual story about the Dirawong Tribe Massacre at Evans Head, spoken by an Aboriginal of the Bundjalung Nation;\n\n''\"This area around Evans Head is part of the Bundjalung Nation, it's a magnificent landscape but among the wildflowers, the bush, trees, and the dunes, ghosts lurk about everywhere. It is said by different people, even today who have been to Evans Head that, 'if you walk along any lonely beach in the area near dusk and stand at the edge of the dunes, you will hear the sound of screaming, wailing, and of the weeping of children and women who were murdered by the white settlers back in the mid 19th century'. These were the victims of an illegal massacre of over 100 Aboriginal women and children.\n\n''Even today at Evans Head, the ghosts of those who were massacred remind us of those long, forgotten blood-soaked days, as their spirits wail and weep, hoping to someday rest. I know some of you people out there in the world who are skeptical would say: 'The sounds are made by birds, trees, sand, storms, waves or the wind or something else'...Are you really sure of that? Would you care to check it out personally yourself, or investigate the sounds by carrying out some Spiritual and Scientific research? Even today it\u2019s a grim reminder to everyone around the world of Australia's not so nice history.\"''\n\n==Legends from the Biripi Nation related to Bundjalung Nation Legends==\n\n===Legend of 'The Three Brothers'===\n\n====Biripi Nation - 'The Three Brothers' Story 1====\n\nThe Three Brothers are also known as three mountains in the Hastings area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. They were named by Lieutenant [[James Cook]] (also known as Captain Cook [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Navy|RN]]) during his voyage along the east coast of Australia in May 1770.\n\nThe name 'Three Brothers' is a striking coincidence, as the mythology of the [[Biripi]] Nation Aboriginal people, the Birpai, tell of a Dreamtime legend describing how three brothers from the Birpai tribe met their fate at the hands of the witch named Widjirriejuggi. The Three Brothers were buried where each mountain stands.<ref>[[Three Brothers, New South Wales|The Three Brothers]]</ref>\n\n\u201cWay back in the Dreamtime, there were three brothers (Binghi) of the Birpai tribe who lived near the mouth of the Camden Haven River. They were strong young men, bright eyed and good hunters of the swift wallaby, the brown pigeon and the cunning goanna.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs part of their growth to full manhood, they had undergone various stages of the initiation ceremonies of their tribe. As part of this, they had to live alone in the bush for many months to prove they could survive by themselves.\u201d\n \n\u201cAfter several months away from their family and friends, they began to wonder how their parents were, whether they were sick or well.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe youngest brother was at a different level to his two brothers in the initiation ritual and he was free to leave after a short time, so he decided to go back to the tribe and check on their mother Gabaway, and their father Babagar.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe said to his brothers, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in just sitting around worrying; you two stay here and I\u2019ll go and see how Mum and Dad are going,\u201d and, waving goodbye, he set off to find his parents.\n \n\u201cBut as he was pushing his way through the scrub, he saw an evil old witch woman (Widjirriejuggik) going in the direction of his brothers\u2019 camp. He didn\u2019t take much notice of her at the time, but when he reached the spot where his parents were camping he told his father about the old woman.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis father was very upset by the news that the witch was hanging about the brothers\u2019 camp and said to the youngest brother: \u201cYou must go back to your brothers quickly and warn them or that old woman will kill them and eat them.\u201d Then his father gave him a special boomerang which he had made with magic to keep him safe.\n \n\u201cNaturally the young brother was horrified at the thought that the wicked old witch might kill and eat his brothers so he set off at once to let them know of the danger that threatened them.\u201d\n \n\u201cEven though he travelled as fast as he could, running through the forest, scratching his legs on the sharp vines and sticks and cutting his feet on pointed rocks, he couldn\u2019t get to the camp before night. He settled down to rest until morning but didn\u2019t sleep much because he was too worried about his brothers.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs soon as the first morning star shone in the pearly light of dawn and he could see where he was going, he started running through the bush again towards the camp.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut he was too late. When he got to the camp, he saw the old witch was there and there was no sign of his brothers.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe asked her what she had done with his two brothers and, since she was such a powerful witch and so sure he couldn\u2019t hurt her, she not only told him straight out that she had eaten the two brothers, but she was going to eat him too.\u201d\n \n\u201cAhh, but she was too confident because she didn\u2019t know about the special boomerang, which the father had made. Quick as a flash, before she had the chance to get him, he jumped up in the air and whacked her on the head with the boomerang, so hard that it split the old witch into two pieces, right down the middle.\u201d\n\n==Legends from the Gundungurra Nation related to Bundjalung Nation Legends==\n\n===Legend of 'The Three Sisters'===\n\n====Katoomba tribe - 'The Three Sisters' Story 1====\n\nThis Gundungurra Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend has it that the local witch doctor of the Katoomba tribe had three beautiful daughters, 'Meehni', 'Wimlah' and Gunnedoo', who were told not to go into the Jamison Valley (Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia) because a fearsome [[Rainbow Serpent|Rainbow Snake]] lived there. The daughters were curious and leaned over the cliff face to look down into the valley and accidentally dislodged some rocks which, falling into the valley below, awoke the Rainbow Snake. The Rainbow Snake was terribly angry and started up the cliff to eat the young girls, the witch doctor saw what was happening and quickly turned his daughters into stone pillars using his magic stick. The Rainbow Snake became enraged and turned on the witch doctor, who then quickly turned himself into a lyrebird. He fled from the Rainbow Snake and lost his magic stick.\n\nThe 3 Sisters are still pillars of stone and if you go for a walk in the Jamison Valley below the 3 Sisters, if you are quiet, you may see a Lyrebird scratching in the forest, still looking for the magic stick so that he can turn himself and his daughters back into human form.\n\n====Interpretation of 'The Three Sisters' legend - (Katoomba tribe Story 1)====\n\n1. In a different version revealed from Aboriginals or Europeans of the legend (which is above), the word 'Bunyip' is used instead of the word 'Rainbow Snake'\n\n2. The 'Rainbow Snake' referred to in the Katoomba tribe dreamtime legend (which is above), is known in science literature (from people who are Atheists) as a physical snake, some type of very large python\n\n3. The story tells us that people should act responsible, and not upset spirits\n\n4. The three females mentioned, are three birds who were turned into spiritual people (Like the Egyptian Cow Gods), now able to see truth, reality and the [[astral plane]]\n\n====Katoomba tribe - 'The Three Sisters' Story 2====\n\n[[Image:blue mountains - three sisters.jpg|thumb|300px|The Three Sisters, 'Meehni' (922 metres tall), 'Wimlah' (918 metres tall) and 'Gunnedoo' (906 metres tall), towering above the [[Jamison Valley]]. The lighter coloured orange/yellow sections indicate fresh rock, exposed by recent erosion.]]\nThis Gundungurra Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend has it that three sisters, 'Meehni', 'Wimlah' and 'Gunnedoo' lived in the Jamison Valley (Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia) as members of the Katoomba tribe within the Gundungurra Nation. Word of their beauty spread and other tribes from other Nations became jealous.\n\nThese three very beautiful maidens had fallen in love with three brothers from the Nepean or Mulgoa (Mulgowey) tribe of the [[Darug people|Darug]] Nation (which is North East of the Gandangara Nation), yet tribal law forbade them to marry outside their own tribe. The brothers were not happy to accept this law and so decided to use force to capture the three sisters causing a major tribal battle.\n\nA terrible battle raged across the mountains \u2013 blood flowed and stained the ground red, colouring the cliffs around. The Katoomba tribe were losing the battle and the maidens were terrified. They ran to the cliff edge and saw the fierce fighting. Their father, who was also the witch doctor of the tribe, cast a magic spell on them to turn them into stone where they stood for their bad behaviour. He planned to change them back after the battle, however he was killed when he went back into the battle.\n\nThe Nepean tribe won and went to claim the maidens, only to find three great pinnacles of rock - the famous 3 Sisters. As only the witch doctor could reverse the spell to return the ladies to their former beauty, the sisters remain in their magnificent rock formation as a reminder of this battle for generations to come. To this day no one has discovered the magic spell which will set them free.\n\n====Interpretation of 'The Three Sisters' legend - (Katoomba tribe Story 2)====\n\nDr Martin Thomas states in his book, 'The Artificial Horizon: Imagining the Blue Mountains' that when he began researching the Blue Mountains, he discovered competing narratives, so he felt that in writing an historically inspired work, it was his job to suggest, evoke and play with narrative as much as just telling it''\n \nDr Martin Thomas points out that; ''\"Myths pose particular problems for traditional historians, who see their work as being about facts and replacing myths with truth or scientific history.\"'' Dr Martin Thomas does not share that view and states that ''\"myth permeates society and we should think creatively about myth and engage with it\"''\n\nExcited by myths that offer prospects of opening rather than closure, Dr Martin Thomas refers to an ancient Blue Mountains myth collected by Robert Hamilton Matthews ([[R. H. Mathews]]), who in 1893 started collecting data on Aboriginal societies. Robert Hamilton Matthews documented an Aboriginal story of creation that effectively maps the local landscape\n\nDr Martin Thomas says to compare Robert Hamilton Matthews 'Aboriginal story of creation' to the legend of 'The Three Sisters' at Echo Point in Katoomba, published in the 1940s, which doesn't have an Aboriginal provenance\n\nThe Three Sisters' story claims that the sisters are three women who were turned to stone. One can see that as a false myth but, as a myth created by the invading colonial culture, it reveals underlying truths about petrifying the Aboriginal sisters and turning them into things you just look at\n\nIn addition, Dr Martin Thomas argues that it is the hallmark of colonisation, with its deletions, denials, losses and absences, that our sense of the past is perpetually unstable, always liable to crack or shatter; and that the 'Three Sisters' legend should not be dismissed as a bogus myth. Precisely because of its ambiguous meaning and origin, it qualifies as myth in the deepest sense <ref>[http://www.newsroom.uts.edu.au/reviews/detail.cfm?ItemId=7378 Myth and meaning in the Blue Mountains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930035741/http://www.newsroom.uts.edu.au/reviews/detail.cfm?ItemId=7378 |date=2009-09-30 }}</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Australian frontier wars]] | [[Australian megafauna]] | [[Bandjalang language]] | [[Bundjalung people|Bundjalung]] | [[Bundjalung Nation Timeline]] | [[Commercialization of traditional medicines]] | [[History wars]] | [[List of legendary creatures]] | [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians]] | [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin]]\n\n==References==\n'''Primary literature'''\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography and resources==\n\n* [[Animal worship]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091013181952/http://www.anbg.gov.au/education/pdfs/aboriginal-bush-medicines.pdf Aboriginal Bush Medicines]\n* [http://www.planetozkids.com/oban/about-aboriginal-dreamtime.htm About the Aboriginal Dreamtime]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120059/http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/Other%20student%20web%20sites/Alex%20N%20Smith/aborigines/stories.htm Aboriginal stories of creation, myths and legends about moral and natural issues]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405093905/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/aboriginal_studies_press/aboriginal_wall_map/map_page/map_detail-f4 Aboriginal Studies Press]\n* [http://ab-ed.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/go/secondary-7-10/science/units-of-work-and-teaching-sequences/story-4-mt-druitt/about-the-topic Aboriginal educational contexts :: About the Topic]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416140453/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/technology/ Australian Indigenous tools and technology]\n* [http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/virgothomas/space/abobeliefs2.html Australian Aboriginal Myths & Legends]\n* [http://sacred-texts.com/aus/index.htm Australian Aboriginal Religion]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100418150946/http://culture.gov.au/articles/indigenous/dreamtime/ Australia's culture Portal]\n* [http://www.jessieyounghusband.w-sussex.sch.uk/curriculum/Australiaweek/aussiey5.htm Australian Week Year 5]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100406065527/http://www.samuseum.australia.sa.com/tindaletribes/badjalang.htm Badjalang (NSW)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100504144458/http://www.bahamasgateway.com/bahamas_bush_medicine.htm Bahamian Bush Medicine]\n* [http://www.wallisandmatilda.com.au/johnsons-antidote.shtml Banjo Paterson Poem -

This meant there was no common written language or alphabet for all tribes like there is for the English, Greeks, or Italians\n\nFourthly, in each case the version used in this article is the one that makes a desirable story while being accurate with what is known of the beliefs and customs of the Bundjalung nation tribal groups <ref>[http://victorian.fortunecity.com/palette/187/aboriginal.html Temple of the Sacred Spiral - Aboriginal Lore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614082152/http://victorian.fortunecity.com/palette/187/aboriginal.html |date=2009-06-14 }}</ref>\n\nBundjalung nation Aboriginal legends are some of the stories of the ancestors from the Dreamtime. The legends portray all sorts of human behaviour, including the less endearing ones such as vanity, lying, cruelty, trickery and cheating. Morality is a key part of these myths. Through the antics of 'The Three Brothers', or of 'The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime', one is aware from the characters' virtue of what might happen should one be tempted into the same temptation\n\n===The \"Dreamtime\"===\nAll the world's peoples have data, information, knowledge or wisdom of how the world was formed. The Bundjalung nation tribal groups believe that, in the beginning, the earth was featureless, flat and grey. There were no mountain ranges, no rivers, no billabongs, no birds or animals, in fact no living creatures, then long, long ago came the [[Dreamtime]]\n\nIn The Dreamtime (also Dreaming, Altjeringa or \"Baribun\" in [[Bundjalung language|Bundjalung]]; A sacred \"once upon a time\" period in which ancestral Totemic Spirit Beings formed \"Creation\") giant creatures began to rise up from the grey plains where they had been slumbering for an unknown amount of time\n\nThese mythical Beings looked like animals, plants or insects, but behaved in a similar manner to humans. Because of their giant size, as these beings wandered across the vast grey wastes, performing ceremonies, digging for water, and searching for food and as they went, they made huge ravines and rivers in the land\n\nThe greatest of all these beings took the form of the Rainbow Snake. The movement of his huge multi colored body across the land formed the mountains and rivers that flow to the ocean. By lifting his tail he makes rainbows. The Bundjalung people tell us that Rainbow Snake and Dirawong worked together to create the northern rivers of nsw & areas of Queensland, causing the world to take on the shape it has today\n \nThe tribal groups of the Bundjalung nation believe that at the start of the \"Dreamtime\" the traditional Aboriginal way of life, practiced in Aboriginal societies today, established from mythical life forms\n\nTraditional Aboriginal groups believe that their ancestors were taught about their tribal lands from the mythical Beings of The Dreamtime, and were told how they, as descendants of these Beings, they should behave. These teachings are as important to their way of life today as the \"Ten commandments\" are to the ancient Israelite Hebrews. After a period of time, these Aboriginal ancestral mythical beings formed into the landscape\n\nAll the mountain ranges or rocks of the \"Dreamtime\" are formed by these beings. Isolated hills, islands, rivers and even trees arose\n\nFrom here time and life in the Bundjalung nation, as we know it, began.  Because of this belief, the land has a very special meaning to the Aboriginal people. Around the earth there are features which act as reminders of the giant Beings of the Dreamtime. When they see a mountain or river, a rock or a tree, they think of the mythical Beings that had a part in their own creation\n\nThe tribal groups of the Bundjalung nation believe that they are directly descended from these mythical Beings. After the Dreamtime, the people were left with a social and cultural heritage which came from their ancestors. All the rites and ceremonies are aimed at preserving this heritage. Their ancestors from the Dreamtime also gave them possession of tribal lands, and hence this land with all the forms of life contained within it are regarded as being in a sacred trust\n\nThe spiritual relationships with the mythical Beings of the Dreamtime are such that tribal groups of the Bundjalung nation believe in a united world of body and spirit with every aspect of the land, both living and non living\n\nThe people of the Bundjalung nation believe that the rocks, rivers and waterholes are more than just a reminder or a symbol of the Dreamtime but represent reality and eternal truth\n\n==Mythology==\nIn ages past, Aboriginal Elders were the storytellers. This was the way things were passed along to the generations that followed. For this reason the Aboriginal Elders of the Bundjalung nation made it a point to remember every detail of a myth, legend or story so they could relate it at a later time. They were the bearers of the traditional morals and imagery which kept spiritual values alive and important\n\nLike the spirits of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the [[United States of America]], the Bundjalung nation Aboriginal spirits, the Dirawong and the Rainbow Snake, continue to live on in the land and water, which originally belonged to the Bundjalung People of the 'far north coast of new south wales' and 'south east Queensland' area\n\n===Spiritual Deities of the Bundjalung nation===\n\n====The Rainbow Snake====\nThe double symbolism used in its name is considered allegoric to the dual nature of the deity, where being a '''[[Rainbow]]''' represents its divine nature or the ability for water to reach the skies and being a '''[[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]]''' represents its human nature or ability to creep on the ground among other animals of the Earth. The Rainbow also shows the ability to split light into different colors.\n\nAlthough the Rainbow Serpent of the Bundjalung people may differ slightly from other Aboriginal representations of the myth, it does retain many of the similar features, stories and characteristics common in other areas. For instance: its gender is not agreed upon and it is linked to rainbows, water, rain, waterholes, rivers, seas, islands, life, social relationships, shape shifting, spirits, goannas, birds, snakes & fertility.\n\nThe belief of the Rainbow Snake as a water spirit is found in many forms. Sometimes it is simply a guardian of a sacred pool or lake and will attack and bring ill health and bad fortune if the sacred place is not correctly respected.\n\nAt other times the Rainbow Snake is a much more powerful water spirit it is the rain itself, the storm, the flood, the life-giving water from the sky. Its rain is vital to life, yet water also has a powerfully destructive side that the Aborigine tribes of Australia were all too aware of. It has been theorized that the dozens of stories of humans being swallowed by the Rainbow Serpent, found through Australia are metaphorical accounts of people being swallowed from flood waters or being drowned in lakes or a pool\n\nIn such cases, it is shown that the Rainbow Snake holds no respect for people, nor does it have a code of morality: it acts only as its nature dictates, often being a blind destructive force. But in the same way as rain it also creates: it creates the world, births many children, brings fertility to the land and humans, and is often associated with the Aborigine soul itself.\n\nThe ferocity with which the Rainbow Snake guards or defends its sacred pools, or the reverence with which it was, and still is, thought of by Aboriginal tribes, indicates that it is a primal force in nature rather than a \u2018God\u2019 in the sense that many people in the Western world today would think of it. It follows only its natural inclinations \u2013 whether they be anger, lust, compassion, or creation \u2013 and its dynamic, raw energy with which it fertilizes the land and creates the world gives to the element of water associations that are not usually thought of in modern Pagan thought. Often, water is seen as passive, reflective, deep, emotional, and spiritual, and is symbolized by the ever-receiving Chalice or womb of the Goddess. But here, in the motif of the Rainbow Snake, we see water as the Cosmic Phallus of active, dynamic creation \u2013 of fertility, of the rawest, most primal part of life. Here water is dangerous, destructive, creative, blind, unfeeling and magical: just like the Rainbow Snake in its many forms.<ref>[http://cardiffpagan.co.uk/magazine/issues/8/articles/rainbow-snake.html Rainbow Snake - Water Spirit, Cosmic Phallus, and Jealous Guardian (Cardiff University Pagan Society)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821111103/http://cardiffpagan.co.uk/magazine/issues/8/articles/rainbow-snake.html |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref>\n\n====The Dirawong (known in English as 'Goanna')====\n\nTo non Australian Aboriginal people, Aboriginal mythology can be difficult to understand because the characters are non human beings, but behave like humans. Many of the myths seem to only care of a particular animal or bird, yet have a symbolic meaning of great importance. For instance, the Sun is a woman, she creates life and she is often the symbolism of water, fire, earth and red ochre, the Moon is male, and commands, has authority or governs the tides and seasonal cycles, he is often the symbolism of a snake, dog, frog or water\n\nCertain tribal groups of the Bundjalung nation believe that the Rainbow snake and Dirawong together created parts of the Richmond River, Goanna Headland, Snake Island and Pelican Island.  Today, every Aboriginal nation has a special symbol, they are known as [[totems]], which represent a spiritual attachment or special link to a particular ancestral Being, such as an animal, fish, bird or plant\n\nTraditionally, Aboriginal people cared for their totem as they would a brother or sister or friend. The Dirawong's tribe is the 'nyangbal' tribe from the [[Far north Coast of New South Wales]] and the Dirawong's totem symbol is the 'Goanna'\n\nWhat exactly is the Dirawong? Reducing the Dirawong's complex features into a formal description, will be limited to a general view or understanding of the Goanna's characteristics. Therefore, the most relevant attributes will be analysed in the light of Aboriginal traditions\n\nAlthough its appearance may differ slightly, it retains similar features and stories and two particular characteristics that remain the same throughout is; its gender is not agreed upon and it is linked to Goannas', Birds, Snakes, ethics, food, land, medicines, morals, rain, social relationships and spirits\n\nBundjalung people believe the spirits of wounded warriors are present within the mountains, their injuries having manifested themselves as scars on the mountainside, and thunder storms in the mountains recall the sounds of those warriors' battles. The patch of 'red ochre' on top of Goanna Headland shows the wound where the Rainbow Snake bit the Dirawong (Goanna) in the dream time\n\n=====Folklore of Bundjalung nation Aborigines=====\n\nGoanna had a prominent place in the culture of Indigenous Australian Bundjalung Nation tribal groups. This included [[totemic]] relationships, [[anthropomorphic]] representations in [[Dreamtime]] stories, and as a food source. Representations of goannas are common in Indigenous artwork, not just as food, but also as a symbolic spiritual [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. Goannas and the mighty [[Perentie]] are often considered two different animals when used in Aboriginal works, as illustrated by the story \"How the Goanna and Perentie got their colours\"\n\n'Nyangbal' tribes people believe that they are direct descendants in spirit of \u201cmythical supernatural being architects\u201d, the Rainbow Snake and Dirawong who created the land and the two totems; the Snake & the Goanna and the land in which Bundjalung Nation tribal groups live. This belief is very important to Nyangbal people, and the goanna of today constantly reminds nyangbal people of that spiritual ancestor. These symbols are also important because they help to show man's unity with nature. They feel special affinity with their related totem animal species\n\nIt is believed that sacred ceremonies have to be re-enacted on a regular basis to maintain the animal species and ensure survival of the humans. Each Bundjalung Nation tribal groups families owns a special area of land and must protect sacred sites representing their personal totems Dreamtime spirits. Bundjalung Nation people travel long distances from all directions to participate in the initiation ceremonies and to educate the young. The journey could last days or several months and women hunt and collect food during the voyage. All animals, birds, insects, reptiles, plants and other life forms, including man, are part of nature, it is only outward forms that are different <ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_dreamtime/index1.htm Australia - Aboriginal - Dreamtime]</ref>\n\nGoannas feature prominently in the mythology and culture of Bundjalung Nation Aboriginals and Australian folklore. This included totemic relationships, [[anthropomorphic]] representations in Dreamtime stories, and as a source of food and medicine\n\nRepresentations of goannas are common in Bundjalung Nation artwork, not just as food, but also as a symbolic spiritual motif\n\n=====Folklore of General European settlers=====\nEuropean settlers perpetuated several old wives' tales about goanna habits and abilities, some of these have persisted in modern folklore amongst campers and bushmen\n\nA common European settlers tale was that the bite of a goanna was infused with a powerful incurable venom. Every year after the bite (or every seven years), the wound would flare up again. For many years it was generally believed by [[herpetologists]] that goannas were non venomous, and that lingering illness from their bites was due solely to [[infection]] and [[septicaemia]] as a result of their saliva being rife with bacteria from carrion and other food sources. However, in 2005 researchers at the [[University of Melbourne]] announced that oral venom glands had been found in both goannas and [[iguanas]]<ref>[http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/view.php?articleID=3009 Goanna venom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316005103/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/view.php?articleID=3009 |date=2011-03-16 }}</ref>[[Image:Banjo Patterson.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Andrew Barton \"Banjo\" Paterson]]\n\nBecause the goanna regularly eats snakes (often involving a fierce struggle between the two), they are often said to be immune to snake venom. The goanna does eat venomous snakes, but no evidence found suggests actual poison immunity. Other stories say the lizard eats a legendary plant, or drinks from a healing spring which neutralises the poison. This is immortalised in [[Banjo Paterson|Andrew Barton \"Banjo\" Paterson]]'s humorous poem [http://airgale.com.au/Poetry/Johnsons%20Antidote.htm Johnson's Antidote]\n\nPossibly related to the above poison immunity, goanna fat or oil has been anecdotally imbued with mystical healing properties. Bundjalung Nation Aborigines traditionally used goanna oil as an important bush medicine, and it also became a common medicine among Europeans in Australia's early days. Said to be a cure-all for all sorts of ailments, and possessing amazing powers of penetration (passing through metal as if it were not there), it was sold amongst early settlers like snake oil (a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat joint pain. However, the most common usage of the phrase is as a derogatory term for compounds offered as medicines which implies that they are fake, fraudulent, quackery, or ineffective) in the Old West of North America\n\n=====Teachings of the Dirawong (Spiritual Creature)=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"background:lightgrey\"\n! # !!

In 1985 a 16 hectare section of the southern part of Goanna Headland became the first aboriginal land grant in New South Wales. This grant was made to the [[Bogal, Jali and Ngulingah Land Councils]]. The major part of Goanna Headland is now a reserve which is managed for the wider community by the [[Dirawong Trust]]. The objectives are to conserve aboriginal culture and heritage, preserve the native flora and fauna and provide recreational activities to the public.\n\nGoanna Headland, located at [[Evans Head, New South Wales|Evans Head]] in [[New South Wales]], is one of the most easterly points on mainland Australia, and the town where [[Queen Elizabeth II]] flew into during her Royal visit to Australia in 1954. The Headland is believed by Bundjalung Nation Aborigines to be the body of the mythical Dirawong. When viewed from above, the headland has a rough outline showing the shape of a goanna, within which the spirit creature is believed to exist even today.\n\nGoanna Headland has been the mythological place of origin of the Bundjalung Nation, for thousands of years. The Bundjalung Nation people represented by 15 [[Australian Aboriginal tribes]], within which are many groups, clans and bands) call the spiritual creature \"The Dirawong\" (goanna). It is the spiritual centre of their culture. Within its landscape are many sacred, secret, and ceremonial sites. To date some 24 [[archaeological sites]] have been located on Goanna Headland to the south of Evans Head Village. Nine sites have also been identified within the [[Broadwater National Park]], which are of aboriginal cultural significance.\n\n==Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal Dreamtime Stories - Myths & Legends==\n\nWe can count ourselves fortunate that some of the ancient Aboriginal languages and\ndreaming tales of the Northern Rivers region and South East Queensland have survived. In just 200 years, and after thousands of years of habitation, the last speakers of the original tongues of this region were all but wiped out. Their sacred land as well as hunting grounds were involuntarily turned into someone else's property. So much has been lost.\n\n===Bundjalung Nation Creation Myth - The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime===\n\n[[Image:Snake Island Dirawong 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Snake Island in the middle of the river, on the right is Pelican Island and in the background is the Dirawong. (2010).]]Since there are numerous versions of the myth, what is in this instance reported is a summarised version, which lacks crucial details essential for the understanding of the myth\n\nIn translating creation myths into English and in using another version instead of the Bundjalung nation Aboriginal dream time story, Europeans have obscured the wisdom passed down from the Australian Aborigines from generation to generation. The creation myth or story is but one aspect of the whole and must be linked with the sacred place, sacred song and sacred ceremony known only to the most knowledgeable initiated elders of each tribe\n\nBundjalung Nation [[oral literature]] [[tradition]] tells the story about a fight between the Dirawong and the Rainbow Snake, that caused the creation of the Bungawalbin River, the Evans River, Pelican Island, Snake Island, other islands in the Evans River, and also an \"island (Rainbow Snake)\" at an unknown geographic location in the Pacific Ocean, and possibly the hill now known as \"Goanna Headland (Dirawong)\"\n\nAccording to the legend, the Rainbow Snake had been very bad. What he did is a secret, and cannot be revealed here, but it was so bad that a [[Weeum]] (known as a 'Clever Man', 'Man of high degree of initiation' or 'Man with great powers') named Nyimbunji from the area known as [[Bungawalbin]], called on the Dirawong (or Goanna) to help protect a Yabbra (or Bird) from the Rainbow Snake (or [[Waugal]])\n\nOnly Dirawong was powerful enough to deal with Rainbow Snake. Dirawong chased Rainbow Snake from inland eastward towards the coast and as they went they formed parts of the [[Richmond River]]. At Maniworkan (or the town of [[Woodburn, New South Wales]], Australia) they left the Richmond River and kept on going east. Halfway down the [[Evans River (New South Wales)|Evans River]], Dirawong caught Rainbow Snake, the Snake turned around and bit Goanna on the head, Dirawong then withdrew from the battle in order to eat some [[herbs]] to recover ([[Healing|heal]]) from the [[snakebite]], when he felt better from the snakebite he resumed his chase\n\nMeanwhile, Rainbow Snake had reached Evans Head. Rainbow Snake looked around. Dirawong was nowhere to be seen, so Rainbow Snake decided to go back west. The Rainbow Snake then went into the Evans River and coiled itself around and created Snake Island. As he turned his body made another larger island in the river, now known as [[Pelican Island (New South Wales)|Pelican Island]]\n\nWhen Rainbow Snake spotted Dirawong heading towards him, Rainbow Snake quickly turned, and this time Rainbow Snake kept going until he reached the Burraga ([[Tasman Sea]], [[Pacific Ocean]]), and made himself into an [[Island]] so Dirawong wouldn't recognise Rainbow Snake\n\nDirawong reached the coast at Evans Head. Dirawong then laid down next to the coast, facing the Burraga, waiting for Rainbow Snake to come back. And you can still hear Rainbow Snake and see Goanna, today at Evans Head. The patch of '[[red ochre]]' on top of Goanna Headland shows the wound where the Rainbow Snake bit the Goanna in the dream time <ref>[http://www.nimbinweb.com.au/bundjalung/index.htm The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime]</ref>\n\n====Interpretation of the Creation Myth - The Rainbow Snake & the Dreamtime====\n\nThe creation was believed to be the work of culture heroes that in the creative epoch traveled across a formless land, creating sacred sites and significant places of interest in their travels. In this way songlines were established, some of which could travel right across Australia, through as many as six to ten different language groupings. The songs and dances of a particular songline were kept alive and frequently performed at large gatherings, organised in good seasons.<ref>[[Dreamtime]]</ref>\n\n====Various Bundjalung nation Aboriginal tribes Legends about 'The Three Brothers'====\n\n=====Bundjalung nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 1=====\nA Bundjalung nation Aboriginal dream time legend tells of three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, their mother and wives who landed at Gummingarr (which is now called [[Chinamens Beach]] at [[Evans Head]], New South Wales, Australia) in canoes (made from the bark of a [[Moreton Bay Pine]] ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]])). While the three brothers repaired one of their canoes, their mother went to look for food. When it was time to leave the three brothers could not find their mother so left without her. On her return she found her three sons had left without her, enraged at being left behind, she called out to the three brothers and in her anger struck the sea with a stick. This caused the first big waves on the sea and caused the three brothers canoe to sink on a reef at the mouth of the Richmond River, and the three brothers then swam ashore at the historical geographical location known as 'Shelley Beach', located at [[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]], New South Wales, Australia (the area was called in Bundjalung language 'Bullinah', meaning place of many oysters in Njangbal language). The three brothers returned overland to find their mother and stayed to settle this country. One brother went south, another west and the third brother north. In doing so the three brothers founded the tribal groups of the Bundjalung Nation.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 2=====\nThis Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend tells of three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, who are said to have come from the sea. The brothers, along with their grandmother, arrived in a canoe made from the bark of a hoop pine. As they followed the coastline, they found a rich land sparsely populated, so they landed at the mouth of the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence river]], where the towns of [[Iluka, New South Wales|Iluka]] and [[Yamba, New South Wales|Yamba]] now stand, and stayed there for a long time, then, leaving their grandmother behind they continued on in their canoe heading up the east coast. At one place they landed and created a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] of fresh water. They stopped along the coast at various places and populated the land. 'The Three Brothers' also made the laws for the Bundjalung Nation people and also the ceremonies of the [[Bora (Australian)|Bora rings]]. The Bora Ring was the meeting place where stories were handed down. That's where the laws came from for all the tribes. The Elders got together and passed down the laws to the younger men of the tribes.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Unknown tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 3=====\nAccording to Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal dream-time, three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, settled on what is now known as Seven Mile beach (between Lennox Head and Broken Head) and one of them, Yarbirri, produced a flow of fresh water by thrusting his spear into the sand. At low tide there is said to be a stain marking the spot from where the water flowed.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Yaegle tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 4=====\nIn the very beginning, three brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, together with their wives and mother traveled from far across the sea, arriving on the Australian coast at the mouth of the Clarence River. Their boat, however, was blown out to sea in a storm, so 'The Three Brothers' decided to build canoes in order to return to their homeland far across the sea.\n\nThey completed building the canoes but could find no sign of their mother anywhere so they set off without her. On returning to find she had been left behind, the mother climbed to the top of a hill and cursed them for abandoning her. She called the ocean to anger and the wild seas forced 'The Three Brothers' back to land at Chinamans Beach, near Evans Head. Once the seas had abated one of 'The Three Brothers' returned south to find their mother. The others settled near Evans Head, developed families and a thriving community.\n\nOne of the families moved north, another west and the third to the south, forming the three branches of the bundjalung people.<ref name=\"planetcorroboree\">[http://www.planetcorroboree.com.au/index.php?pr=Message_Stick Planet Corroboree]</ref>\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Yaegle tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 5=====\nAccording to Bundjalung Legend, The Founding Three Brothers, Mamoonh, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain') and Birrung, made one of their famous landings at what is now Lennox Head said to be near today a group of black rocks on the beach. When the eldest of 'The Three Brothers' Yarbirri, thrust a spear into the sand, fresh water ran ([[Lake Ainsworth]]) and it is said when the tide is low you can still see a rusty stain. After their landing at Lennox Head, the Three Brothers moved north towards [[Brunswick Heads]], where they created the first Bora ground. Thousands of years later, a bora ground remains at Lennox Head, protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is open to the public.<ref name=\"planetcorroboree\"/>\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Ngybul tribe - 'The Three Brothers' Story 6=====\n\"The coastal areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland were associated with the legend of the THREE BROTHERS the ancestors of the Aboriginal people who came from the sea and landed on the east coast. The details of the legend vary from one part of the coast to another, each Aboriginal language area claiming that the brothers landed in their territory.\n\nIn the Northern Rivers area the legend states that the three brothers made their first landing at Yamba or illuka, and after three subsequent landings further north, one at Evans Head, then Ballina and the last at the Lennox boat channel area at Lennox Head, two of the brothers then occupied the coast, while the third moved inland and occupied the Lismore district.\n\nEvans Head was known as Gummingarr, a name derived from gummi, meaning father's mother. This recalls an incident in the legend where the grandmother of the three brothers went into the bush to gather fern roots; she could not be found when the three brothers prepared to paddle northward, and was therefore was left behind. Arriving back at the beach the grandmother grew very angry at being left behind and used her magic to summon up a storm making the first waves on what up till that point had been a waveless ocean. This forced the brothers ashore at Ballina and they went overland back to retrieve the grandmother.\n\nThe next landing was at Lennox Head in the boat channel area (bream hole/moat) of the beach. One of the brothers, named Yarbirri (his beard was a dark red colour), thrust his hunting spear into the sand, and fresh water gushed out. Before the swampy area in the southern corner was filled and drained a ti-tree coloured stain was often seen that resembled a red beard.\n\nAfter Lennox the brothers continued north to their final landing at Brunswick Heads, where they are said to have made the first wandaral or bora ring. Be that as it may, there is a well preserved bora ring in Lennox. It is situated ninety metres west of Gibbon Street and is also adjacent to the Megan Crescent cricket field. It is fenced and maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of NSW and is open to visitors. The Bora Ring was used mainly for male initiation ceremonies.\n\nAfter the first Wandaral ceremony at Brunswick, The eldest brother, Yarbirri, made the laws. The brothers decided to separate and to populate the earth, Yarbirri went north, Mamoon to the west and Birrung to the south. The name Birin (Birrung) was widely used to mean \"southerners\"; the people north of the Brisbane River regarded all of the Bunjalung people as Birin: to the people of the Byron Bay area Birin referred to the people of the Clarence.\"\n\n====Legend of 'Mount Bugerum Boogerum'====\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation - Ngybul tribe - Story 1=====\nAccording to a Bundjalung Legend, Mount Bugerum Boogerum was of enormous spiritual significance to local Aboriginal people. It was said that the eldest of The Founding Three Brothers, Yarbirri (also known as 'yar Birrain'), was known to have been spoken to by God on Mount Bugerum Boogerum, that at least is the belief, and the belief has drawn pilgrims for thousands of years. There is not a great deal of evidence but it is Bundjalung Nation oral history.<ref>[http://www.echo.net.au/archives/21_15-02.html Echo]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Bundjalung Legends about Spirits of The Forest====\n\n=====Legend of the Wiangaree Lagoon=====\nIn ancient times, long before white people came to this country, Aboriginal people living in the area now known as the Upper Richmond River District believed that a lagoon at Wiangaree was haunted by the ghostly spirit of a woman.\n\nOne day a warrior from a tribe living near the lagoon came back to the camp tired from hunting. He was angry when he found that his wife was not there to meet him, as were the wives of the other warriors. The warrior was jealous and thought immediately that his wife was being unfaithful. He went looking for her and became more and more angry with every step he took. When he found her walking in the bush, quite unaware that her husband had returned, he accused her of being unfaithful. Against her determined protests of innocence and her struggles, he drowned her in the lagoon.\n\nIt was said that from time to time the sound of her body struggling in the lagoon could be heard, as could her cries as she sank beneath the surface. The warriors, an ancient people, continue to live there in spirit. And what of the spirit of the woman? Is it the sound of her body splashing in the lagoon or...only a platypus? Are they her death cries one can hear or...merely those of a night bird?\nWho can tell? It was so long ago.\n\n=====Bundjalung Nation Aboriginal Story about the Dirawong Tribe Massacre at Evans Head=====\n\nIn the 1840s, Goanna Headland located at Evans Head, was the site of a massacre of Bundjalung people by Europeans.<ref name=\"woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au\">[http://woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au/history.htm History - Aboriginal - Local Tribes - Bundjalung People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024121116/http://woodburnevansheadrsl.com.au/history.htm |date=2009-10-24 }}</ref> Today, people from all over the world still speak of hearing spiritual voices on the hill around the old campsite in Bundjalung National Park late in the afternoons, and local fishermen have spoken of lights on the Evans River at night. Aboriginal legend says that the lights are from fire sticks.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of a historical and spiritual story about the Dirawong Tribe Massacre at Evans Head, spoken by an Aboriginal of the Bundjalung Nation;\n\n''\"This area around Evans Head is part of the Bundjalung Nation, it's a magnificent landscape but among the wildflowers, the bush, trees, and the dunes, ghosts lurk about everywhere. It is said by different people, even today who have been to Evans Head that, 'if you walk along any lonely beach in the area near dusk and stand at the edge of the dunes, you will hear the sound of screaming, wailing, and of the weeping of children and women who were murdered by the white settlers back in the mid 19th century'. These were the victims of an illegal massacre of over 100 Aboriginal women and children.\n\n''Even today at Evans Head, the ghosts of those who were massacred remind us of those long, forgotten blood-soaked days, as their spirits wail and weep, hoping to someday rest. I know some of you people out there in the world who are skeptical would say: 'The sounds are made by birds, trees, sand, storms, waves or the wind or something else'...Are you really sure of that? Would you care to check it out personally yourself, or investigate the sounds by carrying out some Spiritual and Scientific research? Even today it\u2019s a grim reminder to everyone around the world of Australia's not so nice history.\"''\n\n==Legends from the Biripi Nation related to Bundjalung Nation Legends==\n\n===Legend of 'The Three Brothers'===\n\n====Biripi Nation - 'The Three Brothers' Story 1====\n\nThe Three Brothers are also known as three mountains in the Hastings area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. They were named by Lieutenant [[James Cook]] (also known as Captain Cook [[Royal Society|FRS]] [[Royal Navy|RN]]) during his voyage along the east coast of Australia in May 1770.\n\nThe name 'Three Brothers' is a striking coincidence, as the mythology of the [[Biripi]] Nation Aboriginal people, the Birpai, tell of a Dreamtime legend describing how three brothers from the Birpai tribe met their fate at the hands of the witch named Widjirriejuggi. The Three Brothers were buried where each mountain stands.<ref>[[Three Brothers, New South Wales|The Three Brothers]]</ref>\n\n\u201cWay back in the Dreamtime, there were three brothers (Binghi) of the Birpai tribe who lived near the mouth of the Camden Haven River. They were strong young men, bright eyed and good hunters of the swift wallaby, the brown pigeon and the cunning goanna.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs part of their growth to full manhood, they had undergone various stages of the initiation ceremonies of their tribe. As part of this, they had to live alone in the bush for many months to prove they could survive by themselves.\u201d\n \n\u201cAfter several months away from their family and friends, they began to wonder how their parents were, whether they were sick or well.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe youngest brother was at a different level to his two brothers in the initiation ritual and he was free to leave after a short time, so he decided to go back to the tribe and check on their mother Gabaway, and their father Babagar.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe said to his brothers, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in just sitting around worrying; you two stay here and I\u2019ll go and see how Mum and Dad are going,\u201d and, waving goodbye, he set off to find his parents.\n \n\u201cBut as he was pushing his way through the scrub, he saw an evil old witch woman (Widjirriejuggik) going in the direction of his brothers\u2019 camp. He didn\u2019t take much notice of her at the time, but when he reached the spot where his parents were camping he told his father about the old woman.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis father was very upset by the news that the witch was hanging about the brothers\u2019 camp and said to the youngest brother: \u201cYou must go back to your brothers quickly and warn them or that old woman will kill them and eat them.\u201d Then his father gave him a special boomerang which he had made with magic to keep him safe.\n \n\u201cNaturally the young brother was horrified at the thought that the wicked old witch might kill and eat his brothers so he set off at once to let them know of the danger that threatened them.\u201d\n \n\u201cEven though he travelled as fast as he could, running through the forest, scratching his legs on the sharp vines and sticks and cutting his feet on pointed rocks, he couldn\u2019t get to the camp before night. He settled down to rest until morning but didn\u2019t sleep much because he was too worried about his brothers.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs soon as the first morning star shone in the pearly light of dawn and he could see where he was going, he started running through the bush again towards the camp.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut he was too late. When he got to the camp, he saw the old witch was there and there was no sign of his brothers.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe asked her what she had done with his two brothers and, since she was such a powerful witch and so sure he couldn\u2019t hurt her, she not only told him straight out that she had eaten the two brothers, but she was going to eat him too.\u201d\n \n\u201cAhh, but she was too confident because she didn\u2019t know about the special boomerang, which the father had made. Quick as a flash, before she had the chance to get him, he jumped up in the air and whacked her on the head with the boomerang, so hard that it split the old witch into two pieces, right down the middle.\u201d\n\n==Legends from the Gundungurra Nation related to Bundjalung Nation Legends==\n\n===Legend of 'The Three Sisters'===\n\n====Katoomba tribe - 'The Three Sisters' Story 1====\n\nThis Gundungurra Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend has it that the local witch doctor of the Katoomba tribe had three beautiful daughters, 'Meehni', 'Wimlah' and Gunnedoo', who were told not to go into the Jamison Valley (Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia) because a fearsome [[Rainbow Serpent|Rainbow Snake]] lived there. The daughters were curious and leaned over the cliff face to look down into the valley and accidentally dislodged some rocks which, falling into the valley below, awoke the Rainbow Snake. The Rainbow Snake was terribly angry and started up the cliff to eat the young girls, the witch doctor saw what was happening and quickly turned his daughters into stone pillars using his magic stick. The Rainbow Snake became enraged and turned on the witch doctor, who then quickly turned himself into a lyrebird. He fled from the Rainbow Snake and lost his magic stick.\n\nThe 3 Sisters are still pillars of stone and if you go for a walk in the Jamison Valley below the 3 Sisters, if you are quiet, you may see a Lyrebird scratching in the forest, still looking for the magic stick so that he can turn himself and his daughters back into human form.\n\n====Interpretation of 'The Three Sisters' legend - (Katoomba tribe Story 1)====\n\n1. In a different version revealed from Aboriginals or Europeans of the legend (which is above), the word 'Bunyip' is used instead of the word 'Rainbow Snake'\n\n2. The 'Rainbow Snake' referred to in the Katoomba tribe dreamtime legend (which is above), is known in science literature (from people who are Atheists) as a physical snake, some type of very large python\n\n3. The story tells us that people should act responsible, and not upset spirits\n\n4. The three females mentioned, are three birds who were turned into spiritual people (Like the Egyptian Cow Gods), now able to see truth, reality and the [[astral plane]]\n\n====Katoomba tribe - 'The Three Sisters' Story 2====\n\n[[Image:blue mountains - three sisters.jpg|thumb|300px|The Three Sisters, 'Meehni' (922 metres tall), 'Wimlah' (918 metres tall) and 'Gunnedoo' (906 metres tall), towering above the [[Jamison Valley]]. The lighter coloured orange/yellow sections indicate fresh rock, exposed by recent erosion.]]\nThis Gundungurra Nation Aboriginal dream-time legend has it that three sisters, 'Meehni', 'Wimlah' and 'Gunnedoo' lived in the Jamison Valley (Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia) as members of the Katoomba tribe within the Gundungurra Nation. Word of their beauty spread and other tribes from other Nations became jealous.\n\nThese three very beautiful maidens had fallen in love with three brothers from the Nepean or Mulgoa (Mulgowey) tribe of the [[Darug people|Darug]] Nation (which is North East of the Gandangara Nation), yet tribal law forbade them to marry outside their own tribe. The brothers were not happy to accept this law and so decided to use force to capture the three sisters causing a major tribal battle.\n\nA terrible battle raged across the mountains \u2013 blood flowed and stained the ground red, colouring the cliffs around. The Katoomba tribe were losing the battle and the maidens were terrified. They ran to the cliff edge and saw the fierce fighting. Their father, who was also the witch doctor of the tribe, cast a magic spell on them to turn them into stone where they stood for their bad behaviour. He planned to change them back after the battle, however he was killed when he went back into the battle.\n\nThe Nepean tribe won and went to claim the maidens, only to find three great pinnacles of rock - the famous 3 Sisters. As only the witch doctor could reverse the spell to return the ladies to their former beauty, the sisters remain in their magnificent rock formation as a reminder of this battle for generations to come. To this day no one has discovered the magic spell which will set them free.\n\n====Interpretation of 'The Three Sisters' legend - (Katoomba tribe Story 2)====\n\nDr Martin Thomas states in his book, 'The Artificial Horizon: Imagining the Blue Mountains' that when he began researching the Blue Mountains, he discovered competing narratives, so he felt that in writing an historically inspired work, it was his job to suggest, evoke and play with narrative as much as just telling it''\n \nDr Martin Thomas points out that; ''\"Myths pose particular problems for traditional historians, who see their work as being about facts and replacing myths with truth or scientific history.\"'' Dr Martin Thomas does not share that view and states that ''\"myth permeates society and we should think creatively about myth and engage with it\"''\n\nExcited by myths that offer prospects of opening rather than closure, Dr Martin Thomas refers to an ancient Blue Mountains myth collected by Robert Hamilton Matthews ([[R. H. Mathews]]), who in 1893 started collecting data on Aboriginal societies. Robert Hamilton Matthews documented an Aboriginal story of creation that effectively maps the local landscape\n\nDr Martin Thomas says to compare Robert Hamilton Matthews 'Aboriginal story of creation' to the legend of 'The Three Sisters' at Echo Point in Katoomba, published in the 1940s, which doesn't have an Aboriginal provenance\n\nThe Three Sisters' story claims that the sisters are three women who were turned to stone. One can see that as a false myth but, as a myth created by the invading colonial culture, it reveals underlying truths about petrifying the Aboriginal sisters and turning them into things you just look at\n\nIn addition, Dr Martin Thomas argues that it is the hallmark of colonisation, with its deletions, denials, losses and absences, that our sense of the past is perpetually unstable, always liable to crack or shatter; and that the 'Three Sisters' legend should not be dismissed as a bogus myth. Precisely because of its ambiguous meaning and origin, it qualifies as myth in the deepest sense <ref>[http://www.newsroom.uts.edu.au/reviews/detail.cfm?ItemId=7378 Myth and meaning in the Blue Mountains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930035741/http://www.newsroom.uts.edu.au/reviews/detail.cfm?ItemId=7378 |date=2009-09-30 }}</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Australian frontier wars]] | [[Australian megafauna]] | [[Bandjalang language]] | [[Bundjalung people|Bundjalung]] | [[Bundjalung Nation Timeline]] | [[Commercialization of traditional medicines]] | [[History wars]] | [[List of legendary creatures]] | [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians]] | [[List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin]]\n\n==References==\n'''Primary literature'''\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography and resources==\n\n* [[Animal worship]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091013181952/http://www.anbg.gov.au/education/pdfs/aboriginal-bush-medicines.pdf Aboriginal Bush Medicines]\n* [http://www.planetozkids.com/oban/about-aboriginal-dreamtime.htm About the Aboriginal Dreamtime]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120059/http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/Other%20student%20web%20sites/Alex%20N%20Smith/aborigines/stories.htm Aboriginal stories of creation, myths and legends about moral and natural issues]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405093905/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/aboriginal_studies_press/aboriginal_wall_map/map_page/map_detail-f4 Aboriginal Studies Press]\n* [http://ab-ed.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/go/secondary-7-10/science/units-of-work-and-teaching-sequences/story-4-mt-druitt/about-the-topic Aboriginal educational contexts :: About the Topic]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416140453/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/technology/ Australian Indigenous tools and technology]\n* [http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/virgothomas/space/abobeliefs2.html Australian Aboriginal Myths & Legends]\n* [http://sacred-texts.com/aus/index.htm Australian Aboriginal Religion]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100418150946/http://culture.gov.au/articles/indigenous/dreamtime/ Australia's culture Portal]\n* [http://www.jessieyounghusband.w-sussex.sch.uk/curriculum/Australiaweek/aussiey5.htm Australian Week Year 5]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100406065527/http://www.samuseum.australia.sa.com/tindaletribes/badjalang.htm Badjalang (NSW)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100504144458/http://www.bahamasgateway.com/bahamas_bush_medicine.htm Bahamian Bush Medicine]\n* [http://www.wallisandmatilda.com.au/johnsons-antidote.shtml Banjo Paterson Poem -

Herzogenbusch was, with [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] in occupied France, the only concentration camp run directly by the [[SS]] in western Europe outside [[Germany]]. The camp was first used in 1943 and held 31,000 prisoners. 749 prisoners died in the camp, and the others were transferred to other camps shortly before the camp was liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] in 1944. After the war the camp was used as a prison for Germans and Dutch collaborators. Today there is a visitors' centre with exhibitions and a national monument \"{{ill|Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught|nl}}\" remembering the camp and its victims. The camp is now a museum.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] occupied [[Netherlands]] (1940\u20131945). In 1942 the Nazis transported [[The Holocaust|Jewish]] and other prisoners from the Netherlands via the transit camps [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] and [[Westerbork concentration camp|Westerbork]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], except for 850 prisoners sent to [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].{{r|Longerich2010_360}} When Amersfoort and Westerbork appeared to be too small to handle the large number of prisoners, the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) decided to build a concentration camp in [[Vught]] near the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]].<ref name=\"ref3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nmkampvught.nl/|title=Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught &#124; HERDENKEN IS NADENKEN|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe building of the camp at Herzogenbusch, the German name for 's-Hertogenbosch, started in 1942.<ref name=\"ref3\"/> The camp was modelled on concentration camps in Germany.  The first prisoners, who arrived in 1943, had to finish the construction of the camp; it was used from January 1943 until September 1944. During this period, it held nearly 31,000 prisoners: [[Jews]], [[political prisoner]]s, [[Resistance during World War II|resistance fighters]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]], [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexuals]], [[Homelessness|homeless people]], [[black market|black market traders]], [[crime|criminals]], and [[hostage]]s.\n\nDue to hunger, sickness, and abuse, at least 749 men, women and children died there. Of these, 329 were murdered at the execution site just outside the camp. As allied forces approached Herzogenbusch, the camp was evacuated and the prisoners were transferred to concentration camps further east, with women inmates being transferred to [[Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp]], and the men to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] by 4\u20135 September 1944.<ref name=jsource>{{cite web |title=Concentration Camps: Vught |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Vught.html |website=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=12 October 2015 }}</ref> On 26 October 1944, [[51st (Highland) Division|Scottish troops]] of the 7th [[Black Watch]] and [[Canadian Army|Canadian troops]] of the 96th Battery, 5th Anti-tank Regiment liberated the camp after fighting a rear guard of SS guards left to defend the nearly evacuated camp.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=C S |title=ATTACK ON ST.

During his internment, he wrote a diary, which was smuggled out of the camp in parts; it is now complete and conserved. It records events from 11 February 1943 until 8 February 1944. David wrote poems in his diary and taught Jewish children in the camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1944, he and his family were transported by train to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. David got the chance to throw a letter from the train. The family was later transported to the [[Gro\u00df-Rosen]] camp ([[Langenbielau]]).\n\n<blockquote>\n{{flagicon|NED}}: ''Lieve vrienden, we zijn nu dicht bij de grens. Het is wel teleurstellend, maar we waren erop voorbereid en zijn vol vertrouwen. Ik denk veel aan jullie. ... Ik heb alle brieven en foto's bij me. M'n liefste bezit. Wanneer zien we elkaar weer? Dat zal nu wel lang duren. Maar erdoor komen we. ... Heel veel liefs jongens, bedankt voor alles. Tot ziens.''<br />\n<br />\n{{flagicon|GBR}}: Dear friends, we are now close to the border. It is disappointing, but we were prepared and full of faith. I think a lot about you. ... I have all my dearest possessions with me: my letters and photos. When will we see each other again? That will take a long time. But we shall survive. ... Lots of love everyone, thanks for everything. Goodbye.\n</blockquote>\n\nDavid's mother and brother Max survived the war, but David died during a transport of sick people to [[Dachau]] in 1945.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\n===Diary of Helga Deen===\n\n[[Helga Deen]] ([[Stettin]], Germany, 6 April 1925 \u2013 [[Sobibor]], 16 July 1943) was the author of a diary, discovered in 2004, which describes her stay in the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in Vught, where she was taken during World War II at the age of 18.\n\nAfter her last diary entry, in early July 1943, Helga Deen was deported to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]] and murdered. She was 18 years old.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/21/1098316786614.html \"Shades of Anne Frank in Dutch prison camp diary.\"] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 October 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dutch uncover diary of Nazi camp |date=20 October 2004 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3760680.stm |accessdate=2008-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Commanders==\n\n===Karl Chmielewski===\nThe first commander of Herzogenbusch was 39-year-old [[Karl Chmielewski]].  During the first few months, the camp was poorly run: prisoners didn't receive meals, the sick were barely treated, and the quality of drinking water was very low.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Chmielewski was ultimately tried and sentenced for his brutality towards the prisoners.  He was removed in 1943 for stealing from the camp on a large scale.  In 1961 Chmielewski was sentenced to life imprisonment for his homicidal brutality towards the prisoners.{{r|Segev2001_33}}\n\n===Adam Gr\u00fcnewald===\nThe second commander was 40-year-old [[Adam Gr\u00fcnewald]]. Immediately after assuming command over the camp, he set very strict rules.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In January 1944 he ordered that a group of female prisoners was to be put into one cell. This resulted in what has become known as the [[Bunker Tragedy]]: twelve of the women packed into the cell died during the night. His superiors, unhappy that this tragedy was leaked to the press, brought him before an SS judge and he was sent to the Russian front as a common soldier. He was killed in action in 1945.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\n===Hans H\u00fcttig===\nThe last commander of Herzogenbusch was the 50-year-old [[Hans H\u00fcttig]].  He joined the SS in 1932 as an unpaid volunteer, and the Nazi party soon thereafter.{{sfn|Segev|2001|p=193}} In 1944 Huttig oversaw the evacuation and closure of the camp.{{sfn|Segev|2001|p=195}}\n\n==List of subcamps==\n{{main|List of subcamps of KZ Herzogenbusch}}\n\n==Current state==\nThe execution site near the camp is now a national monument, with a wall bearing the names of all those who died there. The wall has suffered numerous acts of vandalism: Black smears were drawn on the wall, using tar, which has seeped into the stone and is impossible to remove.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\nThe camp was partially demolished after the war.

Herzogenbusch was, with [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] in occupied France, the only concentration camp run directly by the [[SS]] in western Europe outside [[Germany]]. The camp was first used in 1943 and held 31,000 prisoners. 749 prisoners died in the camp, and the others were transferred to other camps shortly before the camp was liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] in 1944. After the war the camp was used as a prison for Germans and Dutch collaborators. Today there is a visitors' centre with exhibitions and a national monument \"{{ill|Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught|nl}}\" remembering the camp and its victims. The camp is now a museum.\n\n==History==\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] occupied [[Netherlands]] (1940\u20131945). In 1942 the Nazis transported [[The Holocaust|Jewish]] and other prisoners from the Netherlands via the transit camps [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] and [[Westerbork concentration camp|Westerbork]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], except for 850 prisoners sent to [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].{{r|Longerich2010_360}} When Amersfoort and Westerbork appeared to be too small to handle the large number of prisoners, the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) decided to build a concentration camp in [[Vught]] near the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]].<ref name=\"ref3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nmkampvught.nl/|title=Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught &#124; HERDENKEN IS NADENKEN|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe building of the camp at Herzogenbusch, the German name for 's-Hertogenbosch, started in 1942.<ref name=\"ref3\"/> The camp was modelled on concentration camps in Germany.  The first prisoners, who arrived in 1943, had to finish the construction of the camp; it was used from January 1943 until September 1944. During this period, it held nearly 31,000 prisoners: [[Jews]], [[political prisoner]]s, [[Resistance during World War II|resistance fighters]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses]], [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexuals]], [[Homelessness|homeless people]], [[black market|black market traders]], [[crime|criminals]], and [[hostage]]s.\n\nDue to hunger, sickness, and abuse, at least 749 men, women and children died there. Of these, 329 were murdered at the execution site just outside the camp. As allied forces approached Herzogenbusch, the camp was evacuated and the prisoners were transferred to concentration camps further east, with women inmates being transferred to [[Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp]], and the men to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] by 4\u20135 September 1944.<ref name=jsource>{{cite web |title=Concentration Camps: Vught |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Vught.html |website=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=12 October 2015 }}</ref> On 26 October 1944, [[51st (Highland) Division|Scottish troops]] of the 7th [[Black Watch]] and [[Canadian Army|Canadian troops]] of the 96th Battery, 5th Anti-tank Regiment liberated the camp after fighting a rear guard of SS guards left to defend the nearly evacuated camp.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=C S |title=ATTACK ON ST.

During his internment, he wrote a diary, which was smuggled out of the camp in parts; it is now complete and conserved. It records events from 11 February 1943 until 8 February 1944. David wrote poems in his diary and taught Jewish children in the camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1944, he and his family were transported by train to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. David got the chance to throw a letter from the train. The family was later transported to the [[Gro\u00df-Rosen]] camp ([[Langenbielau]]).\n\n<blockquote>\n{{flagicon|NED}}: ''Lieve vrienden, we zijn nu dicht bij de grens. Het is wel teleurstellend, maar we waren erop voorbereid en zijn vol vertrouwen. Ik denk veel aan jullie. ... Ik heb alle brieven en foto's bij me. M'n liefste bezit. Wanneer zien we elkaar weer? Dat zal nu wel lang duren. Maar erdoor komen we. ... Heel veel liefs jongens, bedankt voor alles. Tot ziens.''<br />\n<br />\n{{flagicon|GBR}}: Dear friends, we are now close to the border. It is disappointing, but we were prepared and full of faith. I think a lot about you. ... I have all my dearest possessions with me: my letters and photos. When will we see each other again? That will take a long time. But we shall survive. ... Lots of love everyone, thanks for everything. Goodbye.\n</blockquote>\n\nDavid's mother and brother Max survived the war, but David died during a transport of sick people to [[Dachau]] in 1945.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\n===Diary of Helga Deen===\n\n[[Helga Deen]] ([[Stettin]], Germany, 6 April 1925 \u2013 [[Sobibor]], 16 July 1943) was the author of a diary, discovered in 2004, which describes her stay in the Herzogenbusch concentration camp in Vught, where she was taken during World War II at the age of 18.\n\nAfter her last diary entry, in early July 1943, Helga Deen was deported to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]] and murdered. She was 18 years old.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/21/1098316786614.html \"Shades of Anne Frank in Dutch prison camp diary.\"] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 October 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dutch uncover diary of Nazi camp |date=20 October 2004 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3760680.stm |accessdate=2008-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Commanders==\n\n===Karl Chmielewski===\nThe first commander of Herzogenbusch was 39-year-old [[Karl Chmielewski]].  During the first few months, the camp was poorly run: prisoners didn't receive meals, the sick were barely treated, and the quality of drinking water was very low.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Chmielewski was ultimately tried and sentenced for his brutality towards the prisoners.  He was removed in 1943 for stealing from the camp on a large scale.  In 1961 Chmielewski was sentenced to life imprisonment for his homicidal brutality towards the prisoners.{{r|Segev2001_33}}\n\n===Adam Gr\u00fcnewald===\nThe second commander was 40-year-old [[Adam Gr\u00fcnewald]]. Immediately after assuming command over the camp, he set very strict rules.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In January 1944 he ordered that a group of female prisoners was to be put into one cell. This resulted in what has become known as the [[Bunker Tragedy]]: twelve of the women packed into the cell died during the night. His superiors, unhappy that this tragedy was leaked to the press, brought him before an SS judge and he was sent to the Russian front as a common soldier. He was killed in action in 1945.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\n===Hans H\u00fcttig===\nThe last commander of Herzogenbusch was the 50-year-old [[Hans H\u00fcttig]].  He joined the SS in 1932 as an unpaid volunteer, and the Nazi party soon thereafter.{{sfn|Segev|2001|p=193}} In 1944 Huttig oversaw the evacuation and closure of the camp.{{sfn|Segev|2001|p=195}}\n\n==List of subcamps==\n{{main|List of subcamps of KZ Herzogenbusch}}\n\n==Current state==\nThe execution site near the camp is now a national monument, with a wall bearing the names of all those who died there. The wall has suffered numerous acts of vandalism: Black smears were drawn on the wall, using tar, which has seeped into the stone and is impossible to remove.<ref name=\"ref3\"/>\n\nThe camp was partially demolished after the war.
