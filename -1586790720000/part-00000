Over time these tools have evolved, and are today constructed from hardened tool steel. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools is heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the process of renewing the external part of mortar joints|Repointing}}\n \n[[Image:Tuck pointing Westminster.jpg|thumb|Brickwork of [[10 Downing Street]], showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar]]'''Tuckpointing''' (also called tuck pointing or tuck-pointing) is a way of using two contrasting colours of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[brickwork]], with one colour matching the bricks themselves to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made.
