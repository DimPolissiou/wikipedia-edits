Unlike the previous series, this show contains two 11-minute stories as opposed to a full-length 22-minute story. In the first half, Billy Beagle announces Mickey and his friends' races whether the race is in Hot Dog Hills or anywhere around the world. \n\nIn the second half, Minnie and Daisy work as the Happy Helpers alongside Cuckoo Loca (from ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'') where they help out different residents of Hot Dog Hills. Minnie and Daisy use the Turnstyler located in the office and the Happy Helper Van to assume the clothes associated with their jobs that they are hired to help out on. \n\nIn Season 2, the Roadster Racers get their roadsters modified by [[Ludwig Von Drake]] so that they can perform Supercharged moves.\n\nIn Season 3, Mickey builds a mixed-up motor lab that mixes up and transforms cars. It starts to use the classic \"Hot Dog\" song originally written and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]] for ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. This new version of the song is placed between the two segments of each episode and at the end of the final segment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Bret Iwan]]) \u2013 The leader of the Roadster Racers and owner of Mickey's garage.

The first episode under the new title aired on October 14, 2019.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/disney-s-new-mickey-mouse-mixed-up-adventures-premieres-in-oct/</ref>\n\nThis show features some of [[Russi Taylor]]'s final performances as [[Minnie Mouse]] before she died of colon cancer in 2019.<!--Russi may have recorded some episodes before her death, so don't put her years yet.-->\n\n==Plot==\n''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures'' is about the Sensational Six ([[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]], [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]], [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], [[Daisy Duck|Daisy]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]) as they race around their town of Hot Dog Hills and around the world (Pluto does not race in any way). Unlike the previous series, this show contains two 11-minute stories as opposed to a full-length 22-minute story. In the first half, Billy Beagle announces Mickey and his friends' races whether the race is in Hot Dog Hills or anywhere around the world. \n\nIn the second half, Minnie and Daisy work as the Happy Helpers alongside Cuckoo Loca (from ''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'') where they help out different residents of Hot Dog Hills. Minnie and Daisy use the Turnstyler located in the office and the Happy Helper Van to assume the clothes associated with their jobs that they are hired to help out on. \n\nIn Season 2, the Roadster Racers get their roadsters modified by [[Ludwig Von Drake]] so that they can perform Supercharged moves.\n\nIn Season 3, Mickey builds a mixed-up motor lab that mixes up and transforms cars. It starts to use the classic \"Hot Dog\" song originally written and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]] for ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''. This new version of the song is placed between the two segments of each episode and at the end of the final segment.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main article|List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Mickey Mouse]] (voiced by [[Bret Iwan]]) \u2013 The leader of the Roadster Racers and owner of Mickey's garage.
