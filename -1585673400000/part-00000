It appears on their 1983 album, ''[[90125]]''.\n\nIt was the second song from that album to be released as a single. The 12\" single release (ATCO 0-96964) featured an extended \"Hello, Goodbye\" remix by Trevor Horn (9:30) as the A-side, with the B-side consisting of the 7\" single remix (3:52) and the A Capella remix (3:19). The 7\" single includes the two B-side tracks of the 12\".\n\nThere were repeated single-issues, most backed with remixes of the song or an [[a cappella]] version. The original version was occasionally placed as the B-side of \"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\", and on another instance, the original version was found on a 12-inch single with another A-side track, \"[[City of Love]]\".<ref>[http://yesworld.com/gallery/Singles/leaveit.html Yesworld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030224122/http://yesworld.com/gallery/Singles/leaveit.html |date=2007-10-30 }} Yes official website, retrieved 2 February 2007.</ref> The song has the distinction of being the only track from ''90125'' virtually unaltered from the version recorded by Squire, Rabin, White and Kaye before [[Jon Anderson]] rejoined.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe song peaked at number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yes|chart=all}} |title=Yes Album & Song chart History |date= |work=Billboard.com |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref> and number 3 on the Top Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rock Tracks|page=142|author=Whitburn, J.|year=1996|publisher=Record Research|isbn=978-0898201147}}</ref>\n\nThe song is the second track on the album's second side, with the song \"[[Cinema (Yes song)|Cinema]]\" serving as a form of prelude.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video (directed by [[Godley and Creme]]) shows the band standing while going through abstract effects. It was one of the first music videos to utilize [[computer-generated imagery]]. Eighteen different variations of the video were made (the first one, for instance, simply had the band upside-down, but motionless for the whole song), with the eleventh one chosen as the \"standard\" version, and has remained the \"official\" video. A half-hour documentary on the making of the video was broadcast on MTV in 1984. Also, a marathon showing all eighteen videos one after the other was also shown on MTV.\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n* [[Trevor Rabin]] - [[electric guitar]], [[Lead vocalist|co-lead vocals]] \n* [[Jon Anderson]] - co-lead vocals\n* [[Chris Squire]] - [[bass guitar]], [[backing vocals]]\n* [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] - [[electric drums]], backing vocals\n* [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] - [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], backing vocals\n\n==== Additional Personnel ====\n\n* [[Trevor Horn]] \u2013 backing vocals\n* Graham Preskitt \u2013 [[electric violin]]\n\n==Live performances==\n\"Leave It\" appeared in a similar manner on the [[9012Live]] tour as it had on the album; it was the second song performed each night, with \"Cinema\" serving as the intro. The song was performed on all 113 shows of the 9012Live tour, but has never been performed by the band since.<ref>[http://forgottenyesterdays.com/search.asp?mType=7&q=3&sType=2&stime=0&searchq=Leave%20It&alltime=00/00/0000&tname=1&SortBy=tDate&so=asc&memid=0&ssub=0&graphictype=0 Forgotten Yesterdays] Yes tour log, retrieved 2 February 2007</ref>\n\n==Remixes==\nSeveral remixes of the song exist, two of which can be found on a tape issued in 1984, known as ''Twelve Inches on Tape'' ([[Atco Records|Atco]] 7-90156-4-A). The cover of the tape displays the cover of a 12\" A-side single issue of \"Leave It\" backed with \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" as its B-side. This 12\" single, however, may not actually exist, with this cover being only created for the tape. The tape track-list is \"Leave It (Remix)\", \"Owner of a Lonely Heart (Red and Blue Mix)\", \"Leave It (Hello, Goodbye Mix)\", \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", the last of which is the same as the ''90125'' album version.

It appears on their 1983 album, ''[[90125]]''.\n\nIt was the second song from that album to be released as a single. The 12\" single release (ATCO 0-96964) featured an extended \"Hello, Goodbye\" remix by Trevor Horn (9:30) as the A-side, with the B-side consisting of the 7\" single remix (3:52) and the A Capella remix (3:19). The 7\" single includes the two B-side tracks of the 12\".\n\nThere were repeated single-issues, most backed with remixes of the song or an [[a cappella]] version. The original version was occasionally placed as the B-side of \"[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]\", and on another instance, the original version was found on a 12-inch single with another A-side track, \"[[City of Love]]\".<ref>[http://yesworld.com/gallery/Singles/leaveit.html Yesworld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030224122/http://yesworld.com/gallery/Singles/leaveit.html |date=2007-10-30 }} Yes official website, retrieved 2 February 2007.</ref> The song has the distinction of being the only track from ''90125'' virtually unaltered from the version recorded by Squire, Rabin, White and Kaye before [[Jon Anderson]] rejoined.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe song peaked at number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yes|chart=all}} |title=Yes Album & Song chart History |date= |work=Billboard.com |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref> and number 3 on the Top Album Rock Tracks chart.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rock Tracks|page=142|author=Whitburn, J.|year=1996|publisher=Record Research|isbn=978-0898201147}}</ref>\n\nThe song is the second track on the album's second side, with the song \"[[Cinema (Yes song)|Cinema]]\" serving as a form of prelude.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video (directed by [[Godley and Creme]]) shows the band standing while going through abstract effects.

Dia also presents exhibitions and programs at Dia:Chelsea in New York City, located at 535, 541 and 545 West 22nd Street. In addition to its exhibition spaces at Dia:Beacon and Dia:Chelsea, Dia maintains and operates a constellation of commissions, long-term installations, and site-specific projects, notably focused on land art, nationally and internationally. Dia's permanent collection holdings include artworks by artists who came to prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Agnes Martin]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. The art of this period represented a radical departure in artistic practice and is often large in scale; it is occasionally ephemeral or site-specific.\n\nCurrently, Dia commissions, supports, and presents site-specific installations and long-term exhibitions of work by these artists, as well as those of younger generations.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1974 as the Dia Art Foundation, it first patronized a group of artists that included [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Marian Zazeela]].<ref name=\"Remains of the Dia\"/> They got stipends, studios, and archivists in anticipation of one-man museums that Dia planned for several of them.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[Michael Kimmelman]] (September 15, 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/arts/at-dia-fresh-wounds-and-a-fresh-start.html At Dia, Fresh Wounds and a Fresh Start] ''The New York Times''.</ref> Philippa's husband, Francesco Pellizzi, was on the original six-member board, and Dominique and Christophe de Menil were on the advisory council.

The mosque was removed from 155 Mercer Street. La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela had to leave the Harrison Street building, which was then sold for $5.5&nbsp;million. By the end of 1987, real-estate and art sales had brought in about $17 million to pay the debt and start an endowment.

In keeping with Dia's mandate, the exhibitions, at what would be later renamed Dia:Chelsea, focused on individual artists, and typically offered an artist an entire floor on which to develop a new project or create a focused presentation of existing work. The exhibitions were on view for about one year to allow extended viewing.\n\nAmong the many artists who created site-specific exhibition projects for Dia are [[Robert Gober]], [[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Juan Mu\u00f1oz]], [[Jorge Pardo (artist)|Jorge Pardo]], [[Jessica Stockholder]], [[Diana Thater]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]].

Programming at [[Dia:Beacon]] includes a series of year-long temporary exhibitions as well as public programs designed to complement the collection and exhibitions, including monthly Gallery Talks, music performances by St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, and Community Free Days for neighboring counties. Since 2001 Dia has worked with the [[Beacon City Schools]] to develop an Arts Education Program that serves area students at all education levels, making Dia's collection a valuable resource to students and their teachers and families.\n\nPrograms in New York City include the Artists on Artists lecture series, which focuses on the work of artists in Dia's collection and exhibition programs, as well as periodic performances and other special events. Dia's collaboration with the Hispanic Society includes additional educational programs for local schools, as well as lectures and other public programs.\n\n===Publications===\nDia's publication program produces books in conjunction with selected exhibitions, scholarly volumes on the permanent collection, and other program-related publications, audio works on CD, and multimedia works.\n\n==Management==\n\n===Funding===\nThe Dia Art Foundation is a tax-exempt [[charitable organization]].

Dia also presents exhibitions and programs at Dia:Chelsea in New York City, located at 535, 541 and 545 West 22nd Street. In addition to its exhibition spaces at Dia:Beacon and Dia:Chelsea, Dia maintains and operates a constellation of commissions, long-term installations, and site-specific projects, notably focused on land art, nationally and internationally. Dia's permanent collection holdings include artworks by artists who came to prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Agnes Martin]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. The art of this period represented a radical departure in artistic practice and is often large in scale; it is occasionally ephemeral or site-specific.\n\nCurrently, Dia commissions, supports, and presents site-specific installations and long-term exhibitions of work by these artists, as well as those of younger generations.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1974 as the Dia Art Foundation, it first patronized a group of artists that included [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Marian Zazeela]].<ref name=\"Remains of the Dia\"/> They got stipends, studios, and archivists in anticipation of one-man museums that Dia planned for several of them.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[Michael Kimmelman]] (September 15, 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/15/arts/at-dia-fresh-wounds-and-a-fresh-start.html At Dia, Fresh Wounds and a Fresh Start] ''The New York Times''.</ref> Philippa's husband, Francesco Pellizzi, was on the original six-member board, and Dominique and Christophe de Menil were on the advisory council.

In keeping with Dia's mandate, the exhibitions, at what would be later renamed Dia:Chelsea, focused on individual artists, and typically offered an artist an entire floor on which to develop a new project or create a focused presentation of existing work.

Dia commissioned a series of projects by contemporary artists to be installed at the Hispanic Society's [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] complex, on Broadway at 155th Street in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan. The partnership provided a venue at which Dia could present special projects accompanied by Dia publications and educational programs and enabled the Hispanic Society to engage a new audience. This multi-year collaboration began in the fall of 2007 with a new project by artist [[Francis Al\u00ffs]] titled ''Fabiola'', and in late 2008 Dia presented [[Zoe Leonard]]: ''Derroetero''.\n\n==Collections and installations==\n\n===Permanent collection===\nOver Dia's first ten years, its founders assembled a collection of a select group of artists. Among those whose work was commissioned and collected at that time are [[Joseph Beuys]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Imi Knoebel]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[La Monte Young]].

By then, her sound had mellowed from hard rock to more atmospheric pop and the story-based video clip for \"Love Is a Battlefield\" was aimed squarely at MTV, even featuring Benatar in a [[Michael Jackson]]-inspired group dance number. This new pop/rock direction was a huge commercial success, with the single peaking at number 5 in the United States, and #1 in Australia for seven consecutive weeks. The song gained interest in the UK where it peaked at #49. The song also netted Benatar her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for \"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\" of 1983. A live album, ''[[Live from Earth]]'', which was recorded during Benatar's sold-out 'Get Nervous' world tour of America and Europe in 1982 and 1983, contained two studio tracks, \"Love Is a Battlefield\" and \"Lipstick Lies\".

Benatar had become pregnant again and it may have had an effect on her label's support of the album. The tour for this album was only seven dates, cut short because of the pregnancy. It was Benatar's last album recorded for Chrysalis. With very little promotion from Chrysalis, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow (album)|Gravity's Rainbow]]'' failed to have the same commercial success as Benatar's previous work. According to SoundScan, the album sold approximately 160,000 copies in the United States. It is currently available in a two-in-one release with ''True Love'' (import).\n\n''[[Innamorata (album)|Innamorata]]'' (US #171) was released in 1997 on the CMC International record label. A single video was produced for \"Strawberry Wine (Life is Sweet)\". According to [[SoundScan]], the album sold close to 65,000 copies.\n\nBenatar has released only one album of new material since 1997's ''[[Innamorata (album)|Innamorata]]'', which is 2003's ''[[Go (Pat Benatar album)|Go]]'' (US #187). The album included the 9/11 charity single, \"Christmas in America\" as a bonus track. A video was produced for the single \"Have It All\", but was never released until it was leaked on YouTube in 2012; the only video from this album is for the bonus track. They reunited with [[Holly Knight]] with Neil and Holly cowriting the tune \"Girl\". The hard rock title track \"Go!\" became a popular performance song for Benatar's future concerts. According to [[SoundScan]], the album has now sold nearly 34,000 copies.\n\nIn November 2015, Benatar recorded and released a holiday song called \"One December Night\".\n\nIn January 2017, Benatar recorded the song \"Shine\" to support the Women's March on January 21, 2017.  This is her first original non-holiday recording in over 10 years. In September of the same year Benatar again teamed with songwriter and producer Linda Perry for the song \"Dancing Through the Wreckage\", which was the lead single from the soundtrack for the documentary ''Served Like a Girl''. In October 2017 the song entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart, eventually peaking at #22 in November. The song also received a nomination for Best Song from a Documentary from the Critics' Choice Awards.\n\n==Personal life==\nPat Benatar married her high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar at the age of 19 in 1972.

By then, her sound had mellowed from hard rock to more atmospheric pop and the story-based video clip for \"Love Is a Battlefield\" was aimed squarely at MTV, even featuring Benatar in a [[Michael Jackson]]-inspired group dance number. This new pop/rock direction was a huge commercial success, with the single peaking at number 5 in the United States, and #1 in Australia for seven consecutive weeks. The song gained interest in the UK where it peaked at #49. The song also netted Benatar her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for \"Best Female Rock Vocal Performance\" of 1983. A live album, ''[[Live from Earth]]'', which was recorded during Benatar's sold-out 'Get Nervous' world tour of America and Europe in 1982 and 1983, contained two studio tracks, \"Love Is a Battlefield\" and \"Lipstick Lies\".

Benatar had become pregnant again and it may have had an effect on her label's support of the album. The tour for this album was only seven dates, cut short because of the pregnancy. It was Benatar's last album recorded for Chrysalis. With very little promotion from Chrysalis, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow (album)|Gravity's Rainbow]]'' failed to have the same commercial success as Benatar's previous work. According to SoundScan, the album sold approximately 160,000 copies in the United States. It is currently available in a two-in-one release with ''True Love'' (import).\n\n''[[Innamorata (album)|Innamorata]]'' (US #171) was released in 1997 on the CMC International record label. A single video was produced for \"Strawberry Wine (Life is Sweet)\". According to [[SoundScan]], the album sold close to 65,000 copies.\n\nBenatar has released only one album of new material since 1997's ''[[Innamorata (album)|Innamorata]]'', which is 2003's ''[[Go (Pat Benatar album)|Go]]'' (US #187). The album included the 9/11 charity single, \"Christmas in America\" as a bonus track. A video was produced for the single \"Have It All\", but was never released until it was leaked on YouTube in 2012; the only video from this album is for the bonus track. They reunited with [[Holly Knight]] with Neil and Holly cowriting the tune \"Girl\". The hard rock title track \"Go!\" became a popular performance song for Benatar's future concerts. According to [[SoundScan]], the album has now sold nearly 34,000 copies.\n\nIn November 2015, Benatar recorded and released a holiday song called \"One December Night\".\n\nIn January 2017, Benatar recorded the song \"Shine\" to support the Women's March on January 21, 2017.  This is her first original non-holiday recording in over 10 years. In September of the same year Benatar again teamed with songwriter and producer Linda Perry for the song \"Dancing Through the Wreckage\", which was the lead single from the soundtrack for the documentary ''Served Like a Girl''. In October 2017 the song entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart, eventually peaking at #22 in November. The song also received a nomination for Best Song from a Documentary from the Critics' Choice Awards.\n\n==Personal life==\nPat Benatar married her high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar at the age of 19 in 1972.

However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously.

In turn, Henry accepted the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the [[Lordship of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.\n\n[[File:Galloglass-circa-1521.jpg|thumb|Irish soldiers, 1521&nbsp;\u2013 by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]]]\nOver the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |date=1998 |website=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |access-date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again.

Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url= http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |access-date=23 January 2009}}</ref> The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].\n\n[[File:Hanging.gif|thumb|upright|[[Half-hanging]] of suspected [[United Irishmen]]]]\nThe \"[[Irish Famine (1740\u20131741)#Cause|Great Frost]]\" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters.

Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Ward 1994 28\">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782\u20131992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>\n\nThe passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799.

The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests.

Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south.\n\n[[File:Carson signing Solemn League and Covenant.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Carson]] signing the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]] in 1912, declaring opposition to [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] \"using all means which may be found necessary\"]]\n\nAlthough Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|\"first-past-the-post\"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.\n\nAlong with [[England and Wales]] and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.\n\n===All-island institutions===\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation bodies,\" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].\n\nThe [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, \"regular and frequent\" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.\n\nThe [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\nIreland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]].

Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and [[Counties of Northern Ireland|six are in Northern Ireland]]. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]].

City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, [[Armagh]], with 14,590 is the seat of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Primate of All Ireland]] and was re-granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 (having lost that status in [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840|local government reforms of 1840]]).

A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921.

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the [[Celtic nations]] of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, [[Isle of Man]] and [[Brittany]].

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best [[wreck dives]] being in [[Malin Head]] and off the [[County Cork]] coast.<ref>{{cite news |last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-28256564.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 June 2004 |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith thousands of lakes, over {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2}} of fish-bearing rivers and over {{convert|3700|km|mi|-1}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular [[angling]] destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> and the range of sea angling species is around 80.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Food and drink===\n{{main|Irish cuisine}}\n[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]\nFood and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.<ref name=\"food_companion\" >{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Davidson |first2=Tom |last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2006 |pages=407\u2013408 |isbn=978-0-19-280681-9}}</ref> Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.<ref name=\"food_companion\" />\n\nFor this reason, pork and [[white meat]] were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted [[bacon]] (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"food_companion\" /> The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) was common<ref>{{cite journal |title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato |first1=Redcliffe Nathan |last1=Salaman |first2=William Glynn |last2=Burton |first3=John Gregory |last3=Hawkes |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1985 |pages=218\u2013219}}</ref> and [[black pudding]], made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the \"[[breakfast roll]]\".\n\nThe introduction of the [[potato]] in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter.

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998.

This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC.

Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |pages= |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern.

The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367.

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]]  argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Luck and the Irish: A Brief History of Change 1970-2000'' (2007), pp 7-36.</ref>\n\nModernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941.

Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|\"first-past-the-post\"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name=\"MErainfall\">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} {{nowrap|(32&nbsp;\u00b0F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\nIreland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]].

As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas.

However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.\n\nEmigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent,<ref>\"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories \u2013 20% sample data]\".

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s.

Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921\u20131930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.\n\n[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]].

Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.\n\nIreland fields a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Pro14]] and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]].

Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard.

While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile.
