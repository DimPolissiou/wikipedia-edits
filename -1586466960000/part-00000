Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2013. 839pp.</ref>  The effects of magnetic fields are commonly seen in [[permanent magnet]]s, which pull on [[ferromagnetic material|magnetic materials]] (such as [[iron]]) and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic fields surround and are created by magnetized material and by moving [[electric charge]]s ([[electric current]]s) such as those used in [[electromagnet]]s.  They exert forces on nearby moving electrical charges and torques on nearby magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location exerts a force on magnetic materials. Both the strength and direction of a magnetic field vary with location.  As such, it is described mathematically as a [[vector field]].\n\nIn [[electromagnetics]], the term \"magnetic field\" is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}. In the [[International System of Units]], {{math|'''H'''}}, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of [[ampere]] per [[meter]].<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 22</ref> {{math|'''B'''}}, magnetic flux density, is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (in SI base units: kilogram per second<sup>2</sup> per ampere),<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 21</ref> which is equivalent to [[newton (unit)|newton]] per meter per ampere. {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} differ in how they account for magnetization. In a [[vacuum]], {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} are the same aside from units; but in a magnetized material, {{math|'''B'''}}/<math>\\mu_0</math> and {{math|'''H'''}} differ by the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the material at that point in the material.\n\nMagnetic fields are produced by moving [[electric charge]]s and the intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s of [[elementary particle]]s associated with a fundamental [[quantum mechanics|quantum property]], their [[Spin (physics)|spin]].<ref name=\"Jiles\">{{cite book\n | last = Jiles\n | first = David C.\n | title = Introduction to Magnetism and Magnetic Materials\n | publisher = CRC\n | edition = 2\n | date = 1998\n | pages = 3\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axyWXjsdorMC&pg=PA3\n | isbn = 978-0412798603\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Feynman\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Feynman\n | first1 = Richard Phillips\n | last2 = Leighton\n | first2 =  Robert B.\n | last3 = Sands\n | first3 =  Matthew\n | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics\n | publisher = California Institute of Technology\n | volume = 2\n | date = 1964\n | pages = 1.7\u20131.8\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uaQfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22magnetic+field\n | isbn = 978-0465079988\n }}</ref> Magnetic fields and [[electric field]]s are interrelated and are both components of the [[electromagnetic force]], one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.\n\nMagnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in [[electrical engineering]] and [[electromechanics]]. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generators]]. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of [[magnetic circuit]]s. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the [[Hall effect]]. The Earth produces [[Earth's magnetic field|its own magnetic field]], which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the [[solar wind]] and is important in [[navigation]] using a [[compass]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of electromagnetic theory}}\n[[Image:Descartes magnetic field.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the first drawings of a magnetic field, by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], 1644, showing the Earth attracting lodestones.  It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles, \"threaded parts\", through threaded pores in magnets.]]\nAlthough magnets and magnetism were studied much earlier, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar [[Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt]] mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles.<ref group=\"nb\">His ''Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt Militem de Magnete'', which is often shortened to ''Epistola de magnete'', is dated 1269 C.E.</ref> Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points \"poles\" in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.\n\nAlmost three centuries later, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] of [[Colchester]] replicated Petrus Peregrinus's work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=34}}</ref> Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, ''[[De Magnete]]'', helped to establish magnetism as a science.

In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=88}}</ref> and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.<ref group=\"nb\">\n\nFrom the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.</ref> This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Amp\u00e8re derived both [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] describing the force between two currents and [[Amp\u00e8re's law]], which, like the Biot\u2013Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp\u00e8re introduced the term [[electrodynamics]] to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nIn 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Later, [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp\u00e8re's force law.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=222}}</ref> In the process, he introduced the [[magnetic vector potential]], which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.\n\nIn 1850, [[Lord Kelvin]], then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp\u00e8re's model and induction.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=244}}</ref> Further, he derived how {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} relate to each other.\n\nThe reason the letters {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided {{math|'''M'''}} to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the [[Metre]], abbreviated \"m\". Others believe the choices were purely random.<ref>Kelvin (1900). \"Kabinett physikalischer Rarit\u00e4ten.\" Page 200</ref><ref>[http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/did/Physik/Schulservice/Physikerkalender/06_26_Lord-Kelvin-of-Largs.pdf Lord Kelvin of Largs]. physik.uni-augsburg.de. 26 June 1824</ref>\n\nBetween 1861 and 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed and published [[Maxwell's equations]], which explained and united all of [[classical theory|classical]] electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled ''[[:Commons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'' and demonstrated the fact that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. [[Heinrich Hertz]] experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.\n\nThe twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]], in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] for details about the [[thought experiment]] that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop [[special relativity]].) Finally, the emergent field of [[quantum mechanics]] was merged with electrodynamics to form [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\n==Definitions, units, and measurement== <!-- note that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] links here -->\n\n[[File:VFPt magnets BHM.svg|thumb|Comparison of {{math|'''B'''}}, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''M'''}} inside and outside a cylindrical bar magnet.]]\n\n=== The B-field ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!Alternative names for '''B'''<ref name=Electromagnetics>E.

Important classes of magnetometers include using [[Search coil|induction magnetometers]] (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, [[Magnetometer#Rotating coil magnetometer|rotating coil magnetometers]], [[Hall effect]] magnetometers, [[proton magnetometer|NMR magnetometers]], [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometers]], and [[Magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|fluxgate magnetometers]]. The magnetic fields of distant [[astronomical object]]s are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [[synchrotron radiation]] that is detectable in [[radio waves]].\n\n==Magnetic field lines{{anchor|Magnetic field line}}==\n{{Main|Field line}}\n\n[[Image:Magnet0873.png|thumb|right|The direction of magnetic [[field line]]s represented by [[iron filings]] sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.]]\n[[Image:Magnetic field near pole.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|[[Compass]] needles point in the direction of the local magnetic field, towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.]]\nMapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nAn alternative method to map the magnetic field is to \"connect\" the arrows to form magnetic ''field lines''. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] in [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]], in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.\n\nAn advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the \"number\" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly \"translated\" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [[surface integral]] of the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p237</ref>\n\nVarious phenomena \"display\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to \"field lines\".<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex07\">The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron, because of the large [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of iron relative to air.</ref> Magnetic field \"lines\" are also visually displayed in [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]], in which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [[ferromagnetic]] substances like [[iron]] and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [[Maxwell stress tensor|tension]], (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. \"Unlike\" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; \"like\" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the [[electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor]].\n\n==Magnetic field and permanent magnets==\n{{Main|Magnet}}\n\n''Permanent magnets'' are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, such as iron and [[nickel]], that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\n\n===Magnetic field of permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic moment|Magnetic moment#Models|l2=Two definitions of moment}}\n\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex05\">Here, \"small\" means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small. \"Larger\" magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just {{math|'''m'''}}.</ref> straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ''strength'' (called its [[magnetic dipole moment]] {{math|'''m'''}}). The [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|equations]] are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, {{math|'''m'''}} points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its {{math|'''m'''}} by 180 degrees.\n\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [[dipole]]s each having their own {{math|'''m'''}}. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\n\nThere are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\n\n===Magnetic pole model and the H-field===\n[[Image:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|200px|upright|The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (\u2212), separated by a distance d produce a {{math|'''H'''}}-field (lines).]]\nIt is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [[Coulomb force]] between electric charges. In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by fictitious ''magnetic charges'' that are spread over the surface of each pole. These ''magnetic charges'' are in fact related to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}}.\n\nThe {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, is analogous to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}, which starts at a positive [[electric charge]] and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole {{math|'''m'''}} is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength {{math|''q''{{sub|m}}}} separated by a small distance vector {{math|'''d'''}}, such that {{math|1='''m''' = ''q''{{sub|m}}&thinsp;'''d'''}}. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field {{math|'''H'''}} both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that  {{math|'''H'''}} is opposite to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}} inside a permanent magnet.\n\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a ''magnetic charge density'', the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.\n\n===Amperian loop model and the B-field===\n{{see also|Gauss's law for magnetism}}\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]\n\nAfter \u00d8rsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is {{math|1=''m'' = ''IA''}} where {{math|''A''}} is the area of the loop.\n\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. One important property of the {{math|'''B'''}}-field produced this way is that magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[solenoidal vector field]]); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.<ref group=\"nb\">Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending.</ref> To date, no exception to this rule has been found. (See [[#Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)|magnetic monopole]] below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex08\">To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.</ref> If a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.\n\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the \"number\"<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex09\">As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total \"number\" of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.</ref> of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\mathbf{B} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = 0,</math>\n}}\n\nwhere the integral is a [[surface integral]] over the [[closed surface]] {{math|''S''}} (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since {{math|d'''A'''}} points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing out and negative for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing in.\n\nThere is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] below.\n\n===Force between magnets===\n{{Main|Force between magnets}}\n\nThe [[magnetic moment#Forces between two magnetic dipoles|force between two small magnets]] is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex04\">Either {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}} may be used for the magnetic field outside the magnet.</ref> of the other.\n\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ''magnetic pole model'' given above. In this model, the ''{{math|'''H'''}}-field'' of one magnet pushes and pulls on ''both'' poles of a second magnet. If this {{math|'''H'''}}-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ''nonuniform'' (such as the {{math|'''H'''}} near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\n\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\n\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.\nMathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} due to a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} is:<ref name=Trigg>\n\nSee Eq. 11.42 in {{cite book |title=AIP physics desk reference |author1=E.

The [[dot product]] {{math|1='''m''' \u00b7 '''B''' = ''mB''cos(''\u03b8'')}}, where {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''B''}} represent the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of the {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} vectors and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between them. If {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}} then the dot product is positive and the gradient points \"uphill\" pulling the magnet into regions of higher {{math|'''B'''}}-field (more strictly larger {{math|'''m''' \u00b7 '''B'''}}). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own {{math|'''m'''}} then [[Integral|summing up the forces on each of these very small regions]].\n\n===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic torque}}\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ''magnetic torque'' on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic torque is used to drive [[electric motor]]s. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [[electromagnet]]s. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See [[#Rotating magnetic fields|Rotating magnetic fields]] below.\n\n[[Image:Dipole in uniform H field.svg|thumb|left|'''torque on a dipole''': An {{math|'''H'''}} field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole ({{math|+''q''}}) and a S pole ({{math|\u2212''q''}}) creating a torque.]]As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same {{math|'''H'''}} also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of {{math|'''m'''}} as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to {{math|1=''\u03c4'' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''mH''sin''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is a constant called the [[vacuum permeability]], measuring {{val|4|end= \u03c0|e=-7}} [[Volt|V]]\u00b7[[Second|s]]/([[Ampere|A]]\u00b7[[meter|m]]) and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''m'''}}.\n\nThe Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the {{math|'''B'''}} field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.\n\n[[Image:cross parallelogram.png|thumb|'''Cross product''': {{math|1=<nowiki>|</nowiki>'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''<nowiki>|</nowiki> = ''a b'' sin\u03b8}}.]]\nMathematically, the torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{H}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 represents the vector [[cross product]]. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\n\n==Magnetic field and electric currents==\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\n\n===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===\n{{Main|Electromagnet|Biot\u2013Savart law|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|l3=Amp\u00e8re's law}}\n[[Image:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|right|[[Right hand grip rule]]: a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.]]\n\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [[point particle|point]] charges, such as [[electron]]s, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=438}}</ref>\n\nMagnetic field lines form in [[concentric]] circles around a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \"[[right-hand grip rule]]\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\n[[Image:Solenoid-1 (vertical).png|50 px|thumb|left|[[Solenoid]]]]\n\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \"[[solenoid]]\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [[Magnetic core|core]] may act as an ''electromagnet'', generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current {{math|I}} (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point){{refn|group=\"nb\" |name=\"ex12\"|In practice, the Biot\u2013Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly.

This force is known as the ''Lorentz force'', and is given by\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B},</math>\nwhere\n{{math|'''F'''}} is the [[force]], {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, {{math|'''v'''}} is the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the particle, and {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]).\n\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [[mechanical work|work]] on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [[magnetic dipole]], or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect<ref name=Deissler>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Deissler, R.J.\n |year=2008\n |title=Dipole in a magnetic field, work, and quantum spin\n |url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/deissler/PhysRevE_77_036609.pdf\n |journal=[[Physical Review E]]\n |volume=77 |issue=3, pt 2\n |page=036609\n |pmid=18517545\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.036609\n|bibcode = 2008PhRvE..77c6609D }}</ref> because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\n\n====Force on current-carrying wire====\n{{Main|Laplace force}}\n\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges.

The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the ''Laplace force''.\nConsider a conductor of length {{math|''\u2113''}}, cross section {{math|''A''}}, and charge {{math|''q''}} due to electric current {{math|''i''}}.

Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ''can'' distinguish between these, see [[#Hall effect|Hall effect]] below.\n\nAn alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is [[Fleming's left-hand rule for motors|Fleming's left-hand rule]].\n\n==Relation between H and B==\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [[bound current]], which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The {{math|'''H'''}}-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ''magnetization'' first.\n\n===Magnetization===\n{{Main|Magnetization}}\n\nThe ''magnetization'' vector field {{math|'''M'''}} represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A&sdot;m<sup>2</sup>, the SI unit of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is ampere per meter, identical to that of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nThe magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)\n\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ''[[bound current]]''. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field due to the magnet. (See [[#Magnetic dipoles|Magnetic dipoles]] below and [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles vs. atomic currents]] for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=266&ndash;268}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{b},</math>\n\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and {{math|''I''<sub>b</sub>}} is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive \"magnetic pole strength\" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S \\mu_0 \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A} = -q_\\mathrm{M}</math>,\n\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''q''<sub>M</sub>}} is the \"magnetic charge\" (in units of [[magnetic flux]]) enclosed by {{math|''S''}}. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\n\n===H-field and magnetic materials===\n{{see also| demagnetizing field}}\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}\\  \\equiv \\ \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\oint \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{tot} - I_\\mathrm{b} = I_\\mathrm{f},</math>\nwhere {{math|I<sub>f</sub>}} represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of {{math|'''H'''}} does not depend at all on the bound currents.<ref name=Slater>{{cite book |title=Electromagnetism |author1=John Clarke Slater |author2=Nathaniel Herman Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GYsphnFwUuUC&pg=PA69 |page=69 |isbn=978-0-486-62263-7 |year=1969 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=first published in 1947 }}</ref>\n\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]].

The {{math|'''H'''}} field lines loop only around \"free current\" and, unlike the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.\n\n===Magnetism===\n{{Main|Magnetism}}\nMost materials respond to an applied {{math|'''B'''}}-field by producing their own magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} and therefore their own {{math|'''B'''}}-fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term ''magnetism'' describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic [[phase (matter)|phase]] of a material.

They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named [[Type II superconductor#Mixed state|mixed state]]) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of {{math|'''M'''}} on {{math|'''B'''}}.\n\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a material dependent parameter called the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [[tensor]] so that {{math|'''H'''}} may not point in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}}. These relations between {{math|'''B'''}}  and {{math|'''H'''}} are examples of [[constitutive equation]]s. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex {{math|'''B'''}}-to-{{math|'''H'''}} relation; see [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|magnetic hysteresis]].\n\n==Energy stored in magnetic fields==\n{{Main|Magnetic energy}}\n{{see also|Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|l1=Magnetic hysteresis}}\n\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\n\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is frequency-independent), the [[energy density]] is:\n\n:<math> u = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}= \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}.</math>\n\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then {{math|''\u03bc''}} can be replaced by {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\n\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume {{math|''\u03b4W''}} needed to cause a small change of magnetic field {{math|''\u03b4'''''B'''}} is:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = \\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nOnce the relationship between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [[Hysteresis|hysteretic materials]] such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\n\n==Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields==\n{{Main|Electromagnetism}}\n\n===Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field===\n{{Main|Faraday's law of induction|Magnetic flux|l1=Faraday's law}}\n\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [[electric field]] (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ''Faraday's law'' and forms the basis of many [[electrical generator]]s and [[electric motor]]s.\n\nMathematically, Faraday's law is:\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t},</math>\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathcal{E}</math> is the [[electromotive force]] (or ''EMF'', the [[voltage]] generated around a closed loop) and {{math|\u03a6}} is the ''magnetic flux''\u2014the product of the area times the magnetic field [[Tangential and normal components|normal]] to that area.  (This definition of magnetic flux is why {{math|'''B'''}} is often referred to as ''magnetic flux density''.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\nThe negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ''opposes'' the ''change'' in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThis integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex14\">\n\nA complete expression for Faraday's law of induction in terms of the electric {{math|'''E'''}} and magnetic fields can be written as:\n<math>\\textstyle\\mathcal{E} = - d\\Phi/dt </math>&ensp;\n<math>\\textstyle= \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma (t)}\\left(  \\mathbf{E}( \\mathbf{r},\\ t) +\\mathbf{ v \\times B}(\\mathbf{r},\\ t)\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\ </math>&ensp;\n<math>\\textstyle=-\\frac {d} {dt}  \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} d \\boldsymbol {A} \\cdot \\mathbf {B}(\\mathbf{r},\\ t),</math>\n where {{math|'''\u2202\u03a3'''(''t'')}} is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface {{math|'''\u03a3'''(''t'')}}, and {{math|d'''A'''}} is an element of surface area of {{math|'''\u03a3'''(''t'')}}. The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance {{math|d'''\u2113'''}} based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation.\n\n</ref> into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.\n\n===Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===\n{{Main|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|l1=Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law}}\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ''Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law'' and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\n\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\n\nThe Maxwell term ''is'' critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form [[electromagnetic waves]], such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\n\n===Maxwell's equations===\n{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}\n\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ''sources''.  (For {{math|'''B'''}} the ''sources'' are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ''Maxwell's Equations''. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]] including both electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe first property is the [[divergence]] of a vector field {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00b7 '''A'''}}, which represents how {{math|'''A'''}} \"flows\" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is zero. (Such vector fields are called [[solenoidal vector field]]s.) This property is called [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [[magnetic monopole]]s. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the [[charge density]] (See [[Gauss's law]]).\n\nThe second mathematical property is called the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], such that {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00d7 '''A'''}} represents how {{math|'''A'''}} curls or \"circulates\" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a \"circulation source\". The equations for the curl of {{math|'''B'''}} and of {{math|'''E'''}} are called the [[Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell equation]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.\n\nThe complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &=  \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} &=  \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''J'''}} = complete microscopic [[current density]] and {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the charge density.\n\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric {{math|'''E'''}} field and an applied magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field by producing their own internal \"bound\" charge and current distributions that contribute to {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}} fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ''free current density'' {{math|'''J'''<sub>f</sub>}} and ''free charge density'' {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>f</sub>}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &=  \\rho_\\mathrm{f}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &=  \\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{f} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the \"bound\" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as well as that between {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}}. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\n\n===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===\n{{Main|Relativistic electromagnetism}}\n\nAccording to [[special relativity|the special theory of relativity]], the partition of the [[electromagnetic force]] into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [[Frame of reference#Observational frames of reference|observational frame of reference]]: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\n\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [[tensor]], called the ''[[electromagnetic tensor]]''. Changing reference frames ''mixes'' these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ''mixes'' space and time into [[spacetime]], and mass, momentum, and energy into [[four-momentum]].<ref>C. Doran and A. Lasenby (2003) ''Geometric Algebra for Physicists'', Cambridge University Press, p. 233. {{ISBN|0521715954}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic vector potential===\n{{Main|Magnetic potential}}\n\nIn advanced topics such as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the ''[[magnetic vector potential]]'' {{math|'''A'''}}, and the [[electric potential|electric scalar potential]] {{math|''\u03c6''}}, are defined such that:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{B} &=  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}, \\\\\n  \\mathbf{E} &= -\\nabla \\varphi - \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{A} }{ \\partial t }.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} may be interpreted as a ''generalized potential [[momentum]] per unit charge''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=E.

''[[Scientific American]]''; Page 36.</ref> See [[orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]].\n\n===Rotating magnetic fields===\n{{Main|Rotating magnetic field|Alternator}}\n\nThe ''rotating magnetic field'' is a key principle in the operation of [[electric motor#AC motors|alternating-current motors]]. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by [[Nikola Tesla]], and later utilized in his and others' early AC ([[alternating current]]) electric motors.\n\nA rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.\n\nThis inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [[electrical power]] supply systems.\n\n[[Synchronous motor]]s use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled\u2014and [[induction motor]]s use short-circuited [[Rotor (electric)|rotors]] (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [[stator]]. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [[eddy current]]s in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.\n\nIn 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, [[Galileo Ferraris]] independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained {{US patent|381968}} for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ''Royal Academy of Sciences'' in [[Turin]].\n\n===Hall effect===\n{{Main|Hall effect}}\n\nThe charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ''Hall effect''.\n\nThe ''Hall effect'' is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).\n\n===Magnetic circuits===\n{{Main|Magnetic circuit}}\nAn important use of {{math|'''H'''}} is in ''magnetic circuits'' where {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} inside a linear material. Here, {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material. This result is similar in form to [[Ohm's law]] {{math|'''J''' {{=}} ''\u03c3'''''E'''}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the current density, {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the conductance and {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ({{math|1=''I'' = ''V''\u2044''R''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac F R_\\mathrm{m},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}</math> is the magnetic flux in the circuit, <math>F = \\int \\mathbf{H}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}</math> is the [[magnetomotive force]] applied to the circuit, and {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit. Here the reluctance {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is a quantity similar in nature to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for the flux.\n\nUsing this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [[circuit theory]].\n\n===Magnetic field shape descriptions===\n[[Image:Magnetic quadrupole moment.svg|right|thumb|Schematic [[quadrupole magnet]] (\"''four-pole''\") magnetic field. There are four steel pole tips, two opposing magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles.]]\n\n*An ''azimuthal'' magnetic field is one that runs east\u2013west.\n*A ''meridional'' magnetic field is one that runs north\u2013south. In the [[solar dynamo]] model of the Sun, [[differential rotation]] of the solar plasma causes the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic field, a process called the ''omega-effect''. The reverse process is called the ''alpha-effect''.<ref>[http://www.cora.nwra.com/~werne/eos/text/dynamo.html The Solar Dynamo].

The field strength grows linearly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis.\n*A ''solenoidal'' magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field, except that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil magnet.\n*A ''toroidal'' magnetic field occurs in a doughnut-shaped coil, the electric current spiraling around the tube-like surface, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''poloidal'' magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''radial'' magnetic field is one in which field lines are directed from the center outwards, similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel. An example can be found in a [[loudspeaker]] transducers (driver).<ref>I. S. Falconer and M. I. Large (edited by I. M.

From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current {{math|''I''}} and an area {{math|''a''}}. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:\n\n:<math>m=Ia, \\,</math>\n\nwhere the direction of {{math|'''m'''}} is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area {{math|''a''}} has been reduced to zero and its current {{math|''I''}} increased to infinity such that the product {{math|1=''m'' = ''Ia''}} is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]] ''rotation by magnetization'' and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]] or ''magnetization by rotation''.<ref name=Graham>See [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|magnetic moment]] and {{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author1=B.

This model produces an {{math|'''H'''}}-field not a {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between [[angular momentum]] and magnetism.\n\n===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===\n{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nA ''magnetic monopole'' is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \"magnetic charge\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.\n\nModern interest in this concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] and [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex10\">Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but these are now considered inconclusive. For details and references, see [[magnetic monopole]].</ref>\n\nIn recent research, materials known as [[spin ice]]s can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.<ref name=\"monopole\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015085916.htm |title='Magnetricity' Observed And Measured For First Time |website=[[Science Daily]] |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"MonopoleReview\">{{cite journal |author=M.J.P.

Magnetic fields surround and are created by magnetized material and by moving [[electric charge]]s ([[electric current]]s) such as those used in [[electromagnet]]s.  They exert forces on nearby moving electrical charges and torques on nearby magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location exerts a force on magnetic materials. Both the strength and direction of a magnetic field vary with location.  As such, it is described mathematically as a [[vector field]].\n\nIn [[electromagnetics]], the term \"magnetic field\" is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}.

In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=88}}</ref> and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.<ref group=\"nb\">\n\nFrom the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.</ref> This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Amp\u00e8re derived both [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] describing the force between two currents and [[Amp\u00e8re's law]], which, like the Biot\u2013Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp\u00e8re introduced the term [[electrodynamics]] to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nIn 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Later, [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp\u00e8re's force law.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=222}}</ref> In the process, he introduced the [[magnetic vector potential]], which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.\n\nIn 1850, [[Lord Kelvin]], then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp\u00e8re's model and induction.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=244}}</ref> Further, he derived how {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} relate to each other.\n\nThe reason the letters {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided {{math|'''M'''}} to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the [[Metre]], abbreviated \"m\". Others believe the choices were purely random.<ref>Kelvin (1900). \"Kabinett physikalischer Rarit\u00e4ten.\" Page 200</ref><ref>[http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/did/Physik/Schulservice/Physikerkalender/06_26_Lord-Kelvin-of-Largs.pdf Lord Kelvin of Largs]. physik.uni-augsburg.de. 26 June 1824</ref>\n\nBetween 1861 and 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed and published [[Maxwell's equations]], which explained and united all of [[classical theory|classical]] electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled ''[[:Commons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'' and demonstrated the fact that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. [[Heinrich Hertz]] experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.\n\nThe twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]], in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] for details about the [[thought experiment]] that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop [[special relativity]].) Finally, the emergent field of [[quantum mechanics]] was merged with electrodynamics to form [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\n==Definitions, units, and measurement== <!-- note that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] links here -->\n\n[[File:VFPt magnets BHM.svg|thumb|Comparison of {{math|'''B'''}}, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''M'''}} inside and outside a cylindrical bar magnet.]]\n\n=== The B-field ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!Alternative names for '''B'''<ref name=Electromagnetics>E.

Important classes of magnetometers include using [[Search coil|induction magnetometers]] (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, [[Magnetometer#Rotating coil magnetometer|rotating coil magnetometers]], [[Hall effect]] magnetometers, [[proton magnetometer|NMR magnetometers]], [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometers]], and [[Magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|fluxgate magnetometers]]. The magnetic fields of distant [[astronomical object]]s are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [[synchrotron radiation]] that is detectable in [[radio waves]].\n\n==Magnetic field lines{{anchor|Magnetic field line}}==\n{{Main|Field line}}\n\n[[Image:Magnet0873.png|thumb|right|The direction of magnetic [[field line]]s represented by [[iron filings]] sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.]]\n[[Image:Magnetic field near pole.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|[[Compass]] needles point in the direction of the local magnetic field, towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.]]\nMapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nAn alternative method to map the magnetic field is to \"connect\" the arrows to form magnetic ''field lines''. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] in [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]], in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.\n\nAn advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the \"number\" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly \"translated\" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [[surface integral]] of the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p237</ref>\n\nVarious phenomena \"display\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to \"field lines\".<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex07\">The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron, because of the large [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of iron relative to air.</ref> Magnetic field \"lines\" are also visually displayed in [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]], in which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [[ferromagnetic]] substances like [[iron]] and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [[Maxwell stress tensor|tension]], (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. \"Unlike\" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; \"like\" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the [[electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor]].\n\n==Magnetic field and permanent magnets==\n{{Main|Magnet}}\n\n''Permanent magnets'' are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, such as iron and [[nickel]], that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\n\n===Magnetic field of permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic moment|Magnetic moment#Models|l2=Two definitions of moment}}\n\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex05\">Here, \"small\" means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small. \"Larger\" magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just {{math|'''m'''}}.</ref> straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ''strength'' (called its [[magnetic dipole moment]] {{math|'''m'''}}). The [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|equations]] are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, {{math|'''m'''}} points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its {{math|'''m'''}} by 180 degrees.\n\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [[dipole]]s each having their own {{math|'''m'''}}. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\n\nThere are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\n\n===Magnetic pole model and the H-field===\n[[Image:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|200px|upright|The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (\u2212), separated by a distance d produce a {{math|'''H'''}}-field (lines).]]\nIt is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [[Coulomb force]] between electric charges. In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by fictitious ''magnetic charges'' that are spread over the surface of each pole. These ''magnetic charges'' are in fact related to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}}.\n\nThe {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, is analogous to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}, which starts at a positive [[electric charge]] and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole {{math|'''m'''}} is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength {{math|''q''{{sub|m}}}} separated by a small distance vector {{math|'''d'''}}, such that {{math|1='''m''' = ''q''{{sub|m}}&thinsp;'''d'''}}. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field {{math|'''H'''}} both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that  {{math|'''H'''}} is opposite to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}} inside a permanent magnet.\n\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a ''magnetic charge density'', the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.\n\n===Amperian loop model and the B-field===\n{{see also|Gauss's law for magnetism}}\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]\n\nAfter \u00d8rsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is {{math|1=''m'' = ''IA''}} where {{math|''A''}} is the area of the loop.\n\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. One important property of the {{math|'''B'''}}-field produced this way is that magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[solenoidal vector field]]); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.<ref group=\"nb\">Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending.</ref> To date, no exception to this rule has been found. (See [[#Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)|magnetic monopole]] below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex08\">To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.</ref> If a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.\n\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the \"number\"<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex09\">As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total \"number\" of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.</ref> of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\mathbf{B} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = 0,</math>\n}}\n\nwhere the integral is a [[surface integral]] over the [[closed surface]] {{math|''S''}} (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since {{math|d'''A'''}} points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing out and negative for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing in.\n\nThere is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] below.\n\n===Force between magnets===\n{{Main|Force between magnets}}\n\nThe [[magnetic moment#Forces between two magnetic dipoles|force between two small magnets]] is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex04\">Either {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}} may be used for the magnetic field outside the magnet.</ref> of the other.\n\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ''magnetic pole model'' given above. In this model, the ''{{math|'''H'''}}-field'' of one magnet pushes and pulls on ''both'' poles of a second magnet. If this {{math|'''H'''}}-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ''nonuniform'' (such as the {{math|'''H'''}} near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\n\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\n\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.\nMathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} due to a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} is:<ref name=Trigg>\n\nSee Eq. 11.42 in {{cite book |title=AIP physics desk reference |author1=E.

The [[dot product]] {{math|1='''m''' \u00b7 '''B''' = ''mB''cos(''\u03b8'')}}, where {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''B''}} represent the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of the {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} vectors and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between them. If {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}} then the dot product is positive and the gradient points \"uphill\" pulling the magnet into regions of higher {{math|'''B'''}}-field (more strictly larger {{math|'''m''' \u00b7 '''B'''}}). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own {{math|'''m'''}} then [[Integral|summing up the forces on each of these very small regions]].\n\n===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic torque}}\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ''magnetic torque'' on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic torque is used to drive [[electric motor]]s. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [[electromagnet]]s. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See [[#Rotating magnetic fields|Rotating magnetic fields]] below.\n\n[[Image:Dipole in uniform H field.svg|thumb|left|'''torque on a dipole''': An {{math|'''H'''}} field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole ({{math|+''q''}}) and a S pole ({{math|\u2212''q''}}) creating a torque.]]As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same {{math|'''H'''}} also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of {{math|'''m'''}} as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to {{math|1=''\u03c4'' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''mH''sin''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is a constant called the [[vacuum permeability]], measuring {{val|4|end= \u03c0|e=-7}} [[Volt|V]]\u00b7[[Second|s]]/([[Ampere|A]]\u00b7[[meter|m]]) and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''m'''}}.\n\nThe Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the {{math|'''B'''}} field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.\n\n[[Image:cross parallelogram.png|thumb|'''Cross product''': {{math|1=<nowiki>|</nowiki>'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''<nowiki>|</nowiki> = ''a b'' sin\u03b8}}.]]\nMathematically, the torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{H}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 represents the vector [[cross product]]. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\n\n==Magnetic field and electric currents==\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\n\n===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===\n{{Main|Electromagnet|Biot\u2013Savart law|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|l3=Amp\u00e8re's law}}\n[[Image:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|right|[[Right hand grip rule]]: a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.]]\n\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [[point particle|point]] charges, such as [[electron]]s, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=438}}</ref>\n\nMagnetic field lines form in [[concentric]] circles around a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \"[[right-hand grip rule]]\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\n[[Image:Solenoid-1 (vertical).png|50 px|thumb|left|[[Solenoid]]]]\n\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \"[[solenoid]]\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [[Magnetic core|core]] may act as an ''electromagnet'', generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current {{math|I}} (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point){{refn|group=\"nb\" |name=\"ex12\"|In practice, the Biot\u2013Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly.

This force is known as the ''Lorentz force'', and is given by\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B},</math>\nwhere\n{{math|'''F'''}} is the [[force]], {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, {{math|'''v'''}} is the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the particle, and {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]).\n\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [[mechanical work|work]] on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [[magnetic dipole]], or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect<ref name=Deissler>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Deissler, R.J.\n |year=2008\n |title=Dipole in a magnetic field, work, and quantum spin\n |url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/deissler/PhysRevE_77_036609.pdf\n |journal=[[Physical Review E]]\n |volume=77 |issue=3, pt 2\n |page=036609\n |pmid=18517545\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.036609\n|bibcode = 2008PhRvE..77c6609D }}</ref> because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\n\n====Force on current-carrying wire====\n{{Main|Laplace force}}\n\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the ''Laplace force''.\nConsider a conductor of length {{math|''\u2113''}}, cross section {{math|''A''}}, and charge {{math|''q''}} due to electric current {{math|''i''}}.

Because of the action of the strong Lorentz force the elliptical orbit is deformed into double 8-shape orbit which symmetry axis additionally rotates slowly around the positively charged nucleus.]]\n\n====Direction of force====\n{{See also|Right-hand rule}}\n\nThe direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a [[mnemonic]] known as the ''right-hand rule'' (see the figure). Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ''can'' distinguish between these, see [[#Hall effect|Hall effect]] below.\n\nAn alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is [[Fleming's left-hand rule for motors|Fleming's left-hand rule]].\n\n==Relation between H and B==\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [[bound current]], which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The {{math|'''H'''}}-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ''magnetization'' first.\n\n===Magnetization===\n{{Main|Magnetization}}\n\nThe ''magnetization'' vector field {{math|'''M'''}} represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A&sdot;m<sup>2</sup>, the SI unit of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is ampere per meter, identical to that of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nThe magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)\n\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ''[[bound current]]''. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field due to the magnet. (See [[#Magnetic dipoles|Magnetic dipoles]] below and [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles vs. atomic currents]] for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=266&ndash;268}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{b},</math>\n\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and {{math|''I''<sub>b</sub>}} is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive \"magnetic pole strength\" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S \\mu_0 \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A} = -q_\\mathrm{M}</math>,\n\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''q''<sub>M</sub>}} is the \"magnetic charge\" (in units of [[magnetic flux]]) enclosed by {{math|''S''}}. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\n\n===H-field and magnetic materials===\n{{see also| demagnetizing field}}\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}\\  \\equiv \\ \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\oint \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{tot} - I_\\mathrm{b} = I_\\mathrm{f},</math>\nwhere {{math|I<sub>f</sub>}} represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of {{math|'''H'''}} does not depend at all on the bound currents.<ref name=Slater>{{cite book |title=Electromagnetism |author1=John Clarke Slater |author2=Nathaniel Herman Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GYsphnFwUuUC&pg=PA69 |page=69 |isbn=978-0-486-62263-7 |year=1969 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=first published in 1947 }}</ref>\n\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]].

The {{math|'''H'''}} field lines loop only around \"free current\" and, unlike the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.\n\n===Magnetism===\n{{Main|Magnetism}}\nMost materials respond to an applied {{math|'''B'''}}-field by producing their own magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} and therefore their own {{math|'''B'''}}-fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied.

They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named [[Type II superconductor#Mixed state|mixed state]]) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of {{math|'''M'''}} on {{math|'''B'''}}.\n\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a material dependent parameter called the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [[tensor]] so that {{math|'''H'''}} may not point in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}}. These relations between {{math|'''B'''}}  and {{math|'''H'''}} are examples of [[constitutive equation]]s. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex {{math|'''B'''}}-to-{{math|'''H'''}} relation; see [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|magnetic hysteresis]].\n\n==Energy stored in magnetic fields==\n{{Main|Magnetic energy}}\n{{see also|Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|l1=Magnetic hysteresis}}\n\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\n\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is frequency-independent), the [[energy density]] is:\n\n:<math> u = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}= \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}.</math>\n\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then {{math|''\u03bc''}} can be replaced by {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\n\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume {{math|''\u03b4W''}} needed to cause a small change of magnetic field {{math|''\u03b4'''''B'''}} is:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = \\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nOnce the relationship between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [[Hysteresis|hysteretic materials]] such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\n\n==Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields==\n{{Main|Electromagnetism}}\n\n===Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field===\n{{Main|Faraday's law of induction|Magnetic flux|l1=Faraday's law}}\n\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [[electric field]] (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ''Faraday's law'' and forms the basis of many [[electrical generator]]s and [[electric motor]]s.\n\nMathematically, Faraday's law is:\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t},</math>\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathcal{E}</math> is the [[electromotive force]] (or ''EMF'', the [[voltage]] generated around a closed loop) and {{math|\u03a6}} is the ''magnetic flux''\u2014the product of the area times the magnetic field [[Tangential and normal components|normal]] to that area.  (This definition of magnetic flux is why {{math|'''B'''}} is often referred to as ''magnetic flux density''.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\nThe negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ''opposes'' the ''change'' in the magnetic field that induced it.

The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance {{math|d'''\u2113'''}} based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation.\n\n</ref> into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.\n\n===Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===\n{{Main|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|l1=Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law}}\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ''Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law'' and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\n\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\n\nThe Maxwell term ''is'' critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form [[electromagnetic waves]], such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\n\n===Maxwell's equations===\n{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}\n\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ''sources''.  (For {{math|'''B'''}} the ''sources'' are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ''Maxwell's Equations''. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]] including both electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe first property is the [[divergence]] of a vector field {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00b7 '''A'''}}, which represents how {{math|'''A'''}} \"flows\" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is zero. (Such vector fields are called [[solenoidal vector field]]s.) This property is called [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [[magnetic monopole]]s. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the [[charge density]] (See [[Gauss's law]]).\n\nThe second mathematical property is called the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], such that {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00d7 '''A'''}} represents how {{math|'''A'''}} curls or \"circulates\" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a \"circulation source\". The equations for the curl of {{math|'''B'''}} and of {{math|'''E'''}} are called the [[Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell equation]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.\n\nThe complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &=  \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} &=  \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''J'''}} = complete microscopic [[current density]] and {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the charge density.\n\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric {{math|'''E'''}} field and an applied magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field by producing their own internal \"bound\" charge and current distributions that contribute to {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}} fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ''free current density'' {{math|'''J'''<sub>f</sub>}} and ''free charge density'' {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>f</sub>}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &=  \\rho_\\mathrm{f}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &=  \\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{f} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the \"bound\" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as well as that between {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}}. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\n\n===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===\n{{Main|Relativistic electromagnetism}}\n\nAccording to [[special relativity|the special theory of relativity]], the partition of the [[electromagnetic force]] into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [[Frame of reference#Observational frames of reference|observational frame of reference]]: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\n\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [[tensor]], called the ''[[electromagnetic tensor]]''. Changing reference frames ''mixes'' these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ''mixes'' space and time into [[spacetime]], and mass, momentum, and energy into [[four-momentum]].<ref>C. Doran and A.

In this representation, the ''[[magnetic vector potential]]'' {{math|'''A'''}}, and the [[electric potential|electric scalar potential]] {{math|''\u03c6''}}, are defined such that:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{B} &=  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}, \\\\\n  \\mathbf{E} &= -\\nabla \\varphi - \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{A} }{ \\partial t }.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} may be interpreted as a ''generalized potential [[momentum]] per unit charge''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=E.

The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is ''quantum electrodynamics'' (QED),<ref>\nFor a good qualitative introduction see:\n{{Cite book|author=Richard Feynman|authorlink=Richard Feynman|title=QED: the strange theory of light and matter|year=2006|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-12575-6|title-link=QED (book)}}\n</ref> which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the ''Standard Model of particle physics''.\n\nIn QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their [[antiparticle]]s) is computed using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as [[Feynman diagram]]s in which [[virtual photon]]s are exchanged.\n\nPredictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10<sup>&minus;12</sup> (and limited by experimental errors); for details see [[precision tests of QED]]. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.\n\nAll equations in this article are in the [[classical electromagnetism|classical approximation]], which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here.

''[[Scientific American]]''; Page 36.</ref> See [[orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]].\n\n===Rotating magnetic fields===\n{{Main|Rotating magnetic field|Alternator}}\n\nThe ''rotating magnetic field'' is a key principle in the operation of [[electric motor#AC motors|alternating-current motors]]. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by [[Nikola Tesla]], and later utilized in his and others' early AC ([[alternating current]]) electric motors.\n\nA rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.\n\nThis inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [[electrical power]] supply systems.\n\n[[Synchronous motor]]s use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled\u2014and [[induction motor]]s use short-circuited [[Rotor (electric)|rotors]] (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [[stator]]. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [[eddy current]]s in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.\n\nIn 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, [[Galileo Ferraris]] independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained {{US patent|381968}} for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ''Royal Academy of Sciences'' in [[Turin]].\n\n===Hall effect===\n{{Main|Hall effect}}\n\nThe charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ''Hall effect''.\n\nThe ''Hall effect'' is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).\n\n===Magnetic circuits===\n{{Main|Magnetic circuit}}\nAn important use of {{math|'''H'''}} is in ''magnetic circuits'' where {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} inside a linear material. Here, {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material. This result is similar in form to [[Ohm's law]] {{math|'''J''' {{=}} ''\u03c3'''''E'''}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the current density, {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the conductance and {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ({{math|1=''I'' = ''V''\u2044''R''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac F R_\\mathrm{m},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}</math> is the magnetic flux in the circuit, <math>F = \\int \\mathbf{H}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}</math> is the [[magnetomotive force]] applied to the circuit, and {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit. Here the reluctance {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is a quantity similar in nature to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for the flux.\n\nUsing this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [[circuit theory]].\n\n===Magnetic field shape descriptions===\n[[Image:Magnetic quadrupole moment.svg|right|thumb|Schematic [[quadrupole magnet]] (\"''four-pole''\") magnetic field. There are four steel pole tips, two opposing magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles.]]\n\n*An ''azimuthal'' magnetic field is one that runs east\u2013west.\n*A ''meridional'' magnetic field is one that runs north\u2013south. In the [[solar dynamo]] model of the Sun, [[differential rotation]] of the solar plasma causes the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic field, a process called the ''omega-effect''. The reverse process is called the ''alpha-effect''.<ref>[http://www.cora.nwra.com/~werne/eos/text/dynamo.html The Solar Dynamo].

The field strength grows linearly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis.\n*A ''solenoidal'' magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field, except that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil magnet.\n*A ''toroidal'' magnetic field occurs in a doughnut-shaped coil, the electric current spiraling around the tube-like surface, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''poloidal'' magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''radial'' magnetic field is one in which field lines are directed from the center outwards, similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel.

From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current {{math|''I''}} and an area {{math|''a''}}. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:\n\n:<math>m=Ia, \\,</math>\n\nwhere the direction of {{math|'''m'''}} is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area {{math|''a''}} has been reduced to zero and its current {{math|''I''}} increased to infinity such that the product {{math|1=''m'' = ''Ia''}} is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]] ''rotation by magnetization'' and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]] or ''magnetization by rotation''.<ref name=Graham>See [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|magnetic moment]] and {{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author1=B.

This model produces an {{math|'''H'''}}-field not a {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between [[angular momentum]] and magnetism.\n\n===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===\n{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nA ''magnetic monopole'' is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \"magnetic charge\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.\n\nModern interest in this concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] and [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex10\">Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but these are now considered inconclusive.

His poems are known for their [[irony]], [[characterization]], dark humour, [[social commentary]], historical [[setting (narrative)|settings]], and challenging [[vocabulary]] and [[syntax]].\n\nBrowning's early career began promisingly, but collapsed. The long poems ''[[Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession|Pauline]]'' and ''[[Paracelsus (poem)|Paracelsus]]'' received some acclaim, but in 1840 the difficult ''[[Sordello (poem)|Sordello]]'', which was seen as wilfully obscure, brought his poetry into disrepute. His reputation took more than a decade to recover, during which time he moved away from the [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelleyan]] forms of his early period and developed a more personal style.\n\nIn 1846, Browning married the older poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]], and went to live in Italy. By the time of her death in 1861, he had published the crucial collection ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]''. The collection ''[[Dramatis Person\u00e6 (poetry collection)|Dramatis Personae]]'' and the book-length [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' followed, and made him a leading British poet. He continued to write prolifically, but his reputation today rests largely on the poetry he wrote in this middle period.\n\nWhen Browning died in 1889, he was regarded as a [[sage writing|sage]] and philosopher-poet who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social and political discourse.   Unusually for a poet, societies for the study of his work were founded while he was still alive. Such [[Browning Society|Browning Societies]] remained common in Britain and the United States until the early 20th century.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nRobert Browning was born in [[Walworth]] in the parish of [[Camberwell]], Surrey, which now forms part of the [[London Borough of Southwark|Borough of Southwark]] in south London. He was baptized on 14 June 1812, at Lock's Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JW86-2ZV |title=Person Details for Robert Browning, \"England Births and Christenings, 1538\u20131975\" \u2013 FamilySearch.org}}</ref> the only son of Sarah Anna (n\u00e9e Wiedemann) and Robert Browning.<ref name=\"Karlin9\">Browning, Robert.

Browning's father had been sent to the [[West Indies]] to work on a sugar plantation, but, due to a slave revolt there, had returned to England. Browning's mother was the daughter of a German shipowner who had settled in [[Dundee]] in Scotland, and his Scottish wife. Browning had one sister, Sarianna. Browning's paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, who had inherited a plantation in St Kitts, was rumoured (within the family) to have a mixed race ancestry, including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was Kittitian rather than Jamaican.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnOSQ7xrcA8C&pg=PA97 |title=Ebony |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |date=May 1995}}</ref><ref>''Dared and done: the marriage of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning'' Knopf, 1995, University of Michigan, p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-679-41602-9}}</ref> The evidence, however, is inconclusive.<ref>''The dramatic imagination of Robert Browning: a literary life'' (2007) Richard S.

As such, Robert was raised in a household of significant literary resources. His mother, to whom he was very close, was a devout [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] and a talented musician.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> His younger sister, Sarianna, also gifted, became her brother's companion in his later years, after the death of his wife in 1861. His father encouraged his children's interest in literature and the arts.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/>\n\nBy 12, Browning had written a book of poetry which he later destroyed when no publisher could be found. After being at one or two private schools, and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor via the resources of his father's extensive library.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> By 14 he was fluent in French, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian and Latin. He became a great admirer of the [[Romantic poets]], especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. Following the precedent of Shelley, Browning became an [[atheism|atheist]] and vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at [[University College London]] but left after his first year.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> His parents' staunch [[evangelicalism|evangelical faith]] prevented his studying at either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University]], both then open only to members of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents' remonstrations, dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son's poems.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/>\n\n===First published works===\n{{Quote box\n |align=right\n |quoted=true\n |bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n |salign=right\n |title=[[s:Waring|Waring]] (ll. 192\u2013200)\n |quote=<poem>Some one shall somehow run a muck \nWith this old world, for want of strife \nSound asleep: contrive, contrive \nTo rouse us, Waring!

Originally Browning considered ''Pauline'' as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J. Fox writing in ''The Monthly Repository'' of April 1833 discerned merit in the work. [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] praised it in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''. However, it sold no copies.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Major Works |first=Robert |last=Browning |editor=Roberts, Adam |editor2=Karlin, Daniel |isbn=978-0-19-955469-0 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Oxford World's Classics}}</ref> Some years later, probably in 1850, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] came across it in the Reading Room of the [[British Museum]] and wrote to Browning, then in [[Florence]] to ask if he was the author.<ref name=\"TheCambridge1907\">{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 volumes (published 1907\u20131921) |volume=XIII|chapter=III}}</ref> [[John Stuart Mill]], however, wrote that the author suffered from an \"intense and morbid self-consciousness\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://britlitwiki.wikispaces.com/Robert+Browning |title=Robert Browning |last=Stevenson |first=Sarah |accessdate=26 August 2012}}</ref> Later Browning was rather embarrassed by the work, and only included it in his collected poems of 1868 after making substantial changes and adding a preface in which he asked for indulgence for a boyish work.<ref name=\"TheCambridge1907\" />\n\nIn 1834, he accompanied the Chevalier George de Benkhausen, the Russian consul-general, on a brief visit to [[St Petersburg]] and began ''Paracelsus'', which was published in 1835.<ref name=\"Browning Poetical Works 1833\u20131864\">{{Cite book| title=Browning Poetical Works 1833\u20131864 |editor=Ian Jack |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1970 |chapter=Introduction and Chronology |isbn=978-0-19-254165-9 |oclc=108532 |url=https://archive.org/details/browningpoetical00brow}}</ref> The subject of the [[Paracelsus|16th-century savant and alchemist]] was probably suggested to him by the Comte Am\u00e9d\u00e9e de Ripart-Monclar, to whom it was dedicated. The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by [[Wordsworth]], [[Dickens]], [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]], J. S. Mill and the already famous [[Tennyson]]. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.\n\nAs a result of his new contacts he met [[William Charles Macready|Macready]], who invited him to write a play.<ref name=\"Browning Poetical Works 1833\u20131864\"/> ''Strafford'' was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.\n\nIn 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for ''[[Sordello (poem)|Sordello]]'', a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by [[Dante]] in the [[Divine Comedy]], canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the Guelph-Ghibelline wars. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson commented that he only understood the first and last lines and Carlyle wrote that his wife had read the poem through and could not tell whether Sordello was a man, a city or a book.<ref>Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) Selected Poems Penguin</ref>\n\nBrowning's reputation began to make a partial recovery with the publication, 1841\u20131846, of ''Bells and Pomegranates'', a series of eight pamphlets, originally intended just to include his plays. Fortunately for Browning's career, his publisher, Moxon, persuaded him to include some \"dramatic lyrics\", some of which had already appeared in periodicals.<ref name=\"Browning Poetical Works 1833\u20131864\"/>\n\n===Marriage===\n{{See also|Elizabeth Barrett Browning}}\n[[File:Thomas B.

They began regularly corresponding and gradually a romance developed between them, leading to their marriage and journey to Italy (for Elizabeth's health) on 12 September 1846.<ref name=\"Karlin10\">Browning, Robert. Ed. Karlin, Daniel (2004) ''Selected Poems'' Penguin p10</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/182 |title=Robert Browning}}</ref> The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth's domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did for each of his children who married: \"The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning.\"<ref>Peterson, William S. ''Sonnets From The Portuguese''. Massachusetts: Barre Publishing, 1977.</ref> At her husband's insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth\u2019s ''Poems'' included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon [[William Wordsworth]]'s death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become [[Poet Laureate]], the position eventually going to [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].\n\nFrom the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth's death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in [[Pisa]], and then, within a year, finding an apartment in [[Florence]] at [[Casa Guidi]] (now a museum to their memory).<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/> Their only child, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning]], nicknamed \"Penini\" or \"Pen\", was born in 1849.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/> In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning's work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as [[Charles Kingsley]], for the desertion of England for foreign lands.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nBrowning identified as a [[liberalism|Liberal]], supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=John |last2=Karlin |first2=Daniel |title=Robert Browning |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=157}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dowden |first1=Edward |title=Robert Browning |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013444744 |date=1904 |publisher=J.M.

They made their home in 17 [[Warwick Crescent]], [[Maida Vale]]. It was only when he became part of the London literary scene\u2014albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)\u2014that his reputation started to take off.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/>\n\nIn 1868, after five years work he completed and published the long blank-verse poem ''[[The Ring and the Book]]''. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning's standards (over twenty-thousand lines), ''The Ring and the Book'' was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a ''tour de force'' of dramatic poetry.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/> Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years.<ref name=\"Karlin11\">Browning, Robert.

According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with [[Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie]], Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth's death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, ''Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day''. It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, ''[[Asolando]]'' (1889), published on the day of his death.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/>\n\nBrowning died at his son's home [[Ca' Rezzonico]] in Venice on 12 December 1889.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/> He was buried in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/>\n\nDuring his life Browning was awarded many distinctions. He was made [[LL.D.]] of Edinburgh, a life Governor of London University, and had the offer of the [[Rector of the University of Glasgow|Lord Rectorship of Glasgow]]. But he turned down anything that involved public speaking.\n\n==History of sound recording==\n{{listen |filename=Robert Browning recites \"How They Brought The Good News From Ghent To Aix\".ogg|title=How They Brought The Good News From Ghent To Aix|description=Browning reciting \"[[How They Brought The Good News From Ghent To Aix]]\"}}\n\nAt a dinner party on 7 April 1889, at the home of Browning's friend the artist [[Rudolf Lehmann (artist)|Rudolf Lehmann]], an [[Edison Records|Edison cylinder phonograph]] recording was made on a white wax cylinder by [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]'s British representative, [[George Edward Gouraud|George Gouraud]].

Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as [[Henry James]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Among living writers, [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series and [[A. S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' refer directly to Browning's work.\n\nToday Browning's critically most esteemed poems include the monologues ''[[Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]'', and ''[[My Last Duchess]]''. His most popular poems include ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', the [[diptych]] ''[[Meeting at Night]]'', the patriotic ''[[Home Thoughts from Abroad]]'', and the children's poem ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]''. His abortive dinner-party recital of ''How They Brought The Good News'' was recorded on an [[Edison Records|Edison]] [[phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]], and is believed to be the oldest surviving recording made in the United Kingdom of a notable person.\n\nBrowning is now popularly known for such poems as ''[[s:Porphyria's Lover|Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[s:My Last Duchess|My Last Duchess]]'', ''[[s:How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix|How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', and ''[[s:The Pied Piper of Hamelin (Browning)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', and also for certain famous lines: \"Grow old along with me!\" (''[[s:Rabbi Ben Ezra|Rabbi Ben Ezra]]''), \"A man's reach should exceed his grasp\" and \"Less is more\" (''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]''), \"It was roses, roses all the way\" (''The Patriot''), and \"God's in His heaven\u2014All's right with the world!\" (''[[Pippa Passes]]'').\n\nHis critical reputation rests mainly on his [[dramatic monologue]]s, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker's character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a [[soliloquy]], the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalising]] past actions or [[special pleading]] his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirization of the sadistic attitude in his ''Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t7JEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22IX+SOLILOQUY+OF+THE+SPANISH+CLOISTER+BY+ROBERT+BROWNING%22&source=bl&ots=c8f72qVfWv&sig=ACfU3U0ANv_7fwmlYAWn2QL8-bQSg6ZXOg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY5NOK4arhAhVEKKwKHSIPC3AQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22IX%20SOLILOQUY%20OF%20THE%20SPANISH%20CLOISTER%20BY%20ROBERT%20BROWNING%22&f=false Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister], full text on Google Books</ref> Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning's poems 1833\u20131864, comments that [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T.

If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made [[Hamlet]]. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is [[George Meredith]]. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\"\n\nProbably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from [[Harold Bloom]]: \"Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival [[Tennyson]] and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by [[literary criticism|criticism]], and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet. [...] Yet when you read your way into his world, precisely his largest gift to you is his involuntary unfolding of one of the largest, most enigmatic, and most multipersoned literary and human selves you can hope to encounter.\"<ref name=\"Bloom2004\">[[Harold Bloom]].

In a largely hostile essay [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote: \"We all want to like Browning, but we find it very hard.\"<ref>Burgess, Anthony [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/15th-april-1966/19/sage-and-mage-of-the-steam-age Sage and Mage of the Steam Age] ''[[The Spectator]]'', 14 April 1966, p. 19. Retrieved 19 October 2013</ref> [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[George Santayana]] were also critical. The latter expressed his views in the essay \"The Poetry of Barbarism,\" which attacks Browning and [[Walt Whitman]] for what he regarded as their embrace of irrationality.\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{sources|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Plaque on Louisa A.M.

His poems are known for their [[irony]], [[characterization]], dark humour, [[social commentary]], historical [[setting (narrative)|settings]], and challenging [[vocabulary]] and [[syntax]].\n\nBrowning's early career began promisingly, but collapsed. The long poems ''[[Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession|Pauline]]'' and ''[[Paracelsus (poem)|Paracelsus]]'' received some acclaim, but in 1840 the difficult ''[[Sordello (poem)|Sordello]]'', which was seen as wilfully obscure, brought his poetry into disrepute. His reputation took more than a decade to recover, during which time he moved away from the [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelleyan]] forms of his early period and developed a more personal style.\n\nIn 1846, Browning married the older poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]], and went to live in Italy. By the time of her death in 1861, he had published the crucial collection ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]''. The collection ''[[Dramatis Person\u00e6 (poetry collection)|Dramatis Personae]]'' and the book-length [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'' followed, and made him a leading British poet. He continued to write prolifically, but his reputation today rests largely on the poetry he wrote in this middle period.\n\nWhen Browning died in 1889, he was regarded as a [[sage writing|sage]] and philosopher-poet who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social and political discourse.   Unusually for a poet, societies for the study of his work were founded while he was still alive. Such [[Browning Society|Browning Societies]] remained common in Britain and the United States until the early 20th century.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nRobert Browning was born in [[Walworth]] in the parish of [[Camberwell]], Surrey, which now forms part of the [[London Borough of Southwark|Borough of Southwark]] in south London.

Browning's paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, who had inherited a plantation in St Kitts, was rumoured (within the family) to have a mixed race ancestry, including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was Kittitian rather than Jamaican.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnOSQ7xrcA8C&pg=PA97 |title=Ebony |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |date=May 1995}}</ref><ref>''Dared and done: the marriage of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning'' Knopf, 1995, University of Michigan, p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0-679-41602-9}}</ref> The evidence, however, is inconclusive.<ref>''The dramatic imagination of Robert Browning: a literary life'' (2007) Richard S.

As such, Robert was raised in a household of significant literary resources.

His father encouraged his children's interest in literature and the arts.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/>\n\nBy 12, Browning had written a book of poetry which he later destroyed when no publisher could be found. After being at one or two private schools, and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor via the resources of his father's extensive library.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> By 14 he was fluent in French, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian and Latin. He became a great admirer of the [[Romantic poets]], especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. Following the precedent of Shelley, Browning became an [[atheism|atheist]] and vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at [[University College London]] but left after his first year.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> His parents' staunch [[evangelicalism|evangelical faith]] prevented his studying at either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University]], both then open only to members of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/> He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents' remonstrations, dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son's poems.<ref name=\"Karlin9\"/>\n\n===First published works===\n{{Quote box\n |align=right\n |quoted=true\n |bgcolor= #FFFFF0\n |salign=right\n |title=[[s:Waring|Waring]] (ll. 192\u2013200)\n |quote=<poem>Some one shall somehow run a muck \nWith this old world, for want of strife \nSound asleep: contrive, contrive \nTo rouse us, Waring!

Originally Browning considered ''Pauline'' as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J.

The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by [[Wordsworth]], [[Dickens]], [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]], J. S. Mill and the already famous [[Tennyson]]. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.\n\nAs a result of his new contacts he met [[William Charles Macready|Macready]], who invited him to write a play.<ref name=\"Browning Poetical Works 1833\u20131864\"/> ''Strafford'' was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.\n\nIn 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for ''[[Sordello (poem)|Sordello]]'', a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by [[Dante]] in the [[Divine Comedy]], canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the Guelph-Ghibelline wars. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson commented that he only understood the first and last lines and Carlyle wrote that his wife had read the poem through and could not tell whether Sordello was a man, a city or a book.<ref>Browning, Robert.

Karlin, Daniel (2004) ''Selected Poems'' Penguin p10</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/182 |title=Robert Browning}}</ref> The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth's domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did for each of his children who married: \"The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning.\"<ref>Peterson, William S. ''Sonnets From The Portuguese''. Massachusetts: Barre Publishing, 1977.</ref> At her husband's insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth\u2019s ''Poems'' included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon [[William Wordsworth]]'s death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become [[Poet Laureate]], the position eventually going to [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].\n\nFrom the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth's death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in [[Pisa]], and then, within a year, finding an apartment in [[Florence]] at [[Casa Guidi]] (now a museum to their memory).<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/> Their only child, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning]], nicknamed \"Penini\" or \"Pen\", was born in 1849.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/> In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning's work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as [[Charles Kingsley]], for the desertion of England for foreign lands.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nBrowning identified as a [[liberalism|Liberal]], supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=John |last2=Karlin |first2=Daniel |title=Robert Browning |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |page=157}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dowden |first1=Edward |title=Robert Browning |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013444744 |date=1904 |publisher=J.M.

It was only when he became part of the London literary scene\u2014albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)\u2014that his reputation started to take off.<ref name=\"Karlin10\"/>\n\nIn 1868, after five years work he completed and published the long blank-verse poem ''[[The Ring and the Book]]''. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning's standards (over twenty-thousand lines), ''The Ring and the Book'' was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a ''tour de force'' of dramatic poetry.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/> Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years.<ref name=\"Karlin11\">Browning, Robert.

According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with [[Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie]], Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth's death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, ''Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day''. It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, ''[[Asolando]]'' (1889), published on the day of his death.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/>\n\nBrowning died at his son's home [[Ca' Rezzonico]] in Venice on 12 December 1889.<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/> He was buried in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name=\"Karlin11\"/>\n\nDuring his life Browning was awarded many distinctions.

Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as [[Henry James]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. Among living writers, [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series and [[A. S. Byatt]]'s ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'' refer directly to Browning's work.\n\nToday Browning's critically most esteemed poems include the monologues ''[[Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]'', and ''[[My Last Duchess]]''. His most popular poems include ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', the [[diptych]] ''[[Meeting at Night]]'', the patriotic ''[[Home Thoughts from Abroad]]'', and the children's poem ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]''. His abortive dinner-party recital of ''How They Brought The Good News'' was recorded on an [[Edison Records|Edison]] [[phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]], and is believed to be the oldest surviving recording made in the United Kingdom of a notable person.\n\nBrowning is now popularly known for such poems as ''[[s:Porphyria's Lover|Porphyria's Lover]]'', ''[[s:My Last Duchess|My Last Duchess]]'', ''[[s:How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix|How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix]]'', and ''[[s:The Pied Piper of Hamelin (Browning)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', and also for certain famous lines: \"Grow old along with me!\" (''[[s:Rabbi Ben Ezra|Rabbi Ben Ezra]]''), \"A man's reach should exceed his grasp\" and \"Less is more\" (''[[Andrea Del Sarto (poem)|Andrea Del Sarto]]''), \"It was roses, roses all the way\" (''The Patriot''), and \"God's in His heaven\u2014All's right with the world!\" (''[[Pippa Passes]]'').\n\nHis critical reputation rests mainly on his [[dramatic monologue]]s, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker's character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a [[soliloquy]], the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalising]] past actions or [[special pleading]] his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirization of the sadistic attitude in his ''Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t7JEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22IX+SOLILOQUY+OF+THE+SPANISH+CLOISTER+BY+ROBERT+BROWNING%22&source=bl&ots=c8f72qVfWv&sig=ACfU3U0ANv_7fwmlYAWn2QL8-bQSg6ZXOg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY5NOK4arhAhVEKKwKHSIPC3AQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22IX%20SOLILOQUY%20OF%20THE%20SPANISH%20CLOISTER%20BY%20ROBERT%20BROWNING%22&f=false Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister], full text on Google Books</ref> Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning's poems 1833\u20131864, comments that [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T.

If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made [[Hamlet]]. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is [[George Meredith]]. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\"\n\nProbably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from [[Harold Bloom]]: \"Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival [[Tennyson]] and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]], and [[Wallace Stevens]]. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by [[literary criticism|criticism]], and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet.

{"title_page": "Anti-Mui Tsai Activism", "text_new": "'''Anti-Mui Tsai Activism''' is efforts to abolish the [[Mui tsai|Mui Tsai]] system. Mui Tsai ({{zh|c=\u59b9\u4ed4|cy=m\u016bi j\u00e1i|l=little sister}}) describes Chinese women, entering the system from a young age, who worked as domestic servants in China, or in brothels or affluent Chinese households in traditional [[Chinese society]]. The Mui Tsai system spread to other parts of the world through [[immigration]] and [[colonization]], causing it to become a human rights issue with out reach as far as [[Great Britain]] and [[America]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the early 1910s, Mui Tsai was discussed by British government officials and activists. They confirmed that the Mui Tsai system was a form of slavery.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Bound to Emancipate: Working Women and Urban Citizenship in Early Twentieth-Century China and Hong Kong|last=Chin|first=Angelina|publisher=RowMan & Littlefield Publishers|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=38\u201351}}</ref> After the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 revolution]], the system was banned in China but this was never effectively enforced. In 1917, the Mui Tsai issue reemerged because of a legal case involving two Mui Tsai who had been kidnapped. A British member of Parliament who happened to be passing through town took the case to the Colonial Office. He questioned how slavery could not only be tolerated but could even be protected by law in the British Empire.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there was an increased interest in social welfare. This led to the debates about prostitution and Mui Tsai.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841 ([[British Hong Kong]]), they proclaimed that the Chinese would be governed according to their own laws and customs.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=157\u2013160}}</ref> This had been the position of the colonial government on the question Anti-Mui Tsai groups pushed it to change.<ref name=\":8\" /> Chinese activists in Hong Kong, including Christians who were educated abroad, labor organizers, feminists and members of the Hong Kong Anti-Mui Tsai Society were involved in the debate of prostitution and Mui Tsai.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign ===\nBy 1920, a campaign against Mui Tsai was created by European missionaries and Christian Chinese. The Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign had three main differences from that of the 1880s. It focused more on the system itself rather than prostitution. This time, the campaign had help from different places: British women in Hong Kong, small groups of local Chinese members of Parliament in Britain, religious leaders, and international women's groups. The [[Colonial Office]] started to receive complaints from these groups.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Anti-Mui Tsai Society ===\nIn July 1921, there was a meeting held at the Tai Ping Theatre and The Society for the Protection of Mui Tsai was created by local elites. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society was formed after the meeting in opposition. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society wrote a manifesto following the meeting. The manifesto states that the system was injurious to public morality, it was subversive of righteousness, and it was damaging to the national body (''dasun guoti''). The manifesto mentioned that representatives of Europe and America had met in Berlin in 1885 and outlawed the slave trade. Therefore, it would be damaging to the Chinese national body to continue such trade within or outside the country.\n\nThe Anti-Mui Tsai Society was dissatisfied with reform since it could not remove the root cause of the problem.<ref name=\":6\" /> Revelations by the Anti-Mui Tsai Society about the ongoing abuse of Mui Tsai caused international observers to become interested in the issue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Towards a Global History of Domestic and Caregiving Workers|last=Hoerder|first=Dirk|publisher=Brill|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=429\u2013448}}</ref> They received backing from local groups such as the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] and was able to gain support from the foreign community and many labor unions. English secretary C.G. Anderson supported the society and helped by writing to the newspapers in Hong Kong and Britain.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Legislations ===\nIn February 1922, the Anti-Slavery Society organized a conference of twenty-two societies to discuss the matter of Mui Tsai.<ref name=\":7\" /> A week later, the Secretary for the Colonies [[Winston Churchill]] argued to the [[House of Commons]] that the system should be abolished.\n\nA meeting was held on January 15, 1923. The chairman of the Chinese Seamen's Union participated and showed willingness to adopt the Mui Tsai question as a labor issue. The Female Domestic Service Ordinance was passed in 1923. The Mui Tsai issue reemerged after the Canton government abolished all forms of slavery in March 1927. In October 1928, the Anti-Mui Tsai Society declared that conditions had become worse since 1923 and sent details to groups in Britain. The bill ended up doing very little, except mainly to prohibit any new Mui Tsai transactions and domestic service for girls under ten years of age.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the secretary of the [[Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society|Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society]] learned about the situation, letters were written to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' that was soon published. Many British activists who had been involved in the campaign in the early 1920s resurfaced. They distributed articles with titles such as \"Little Yellow Slaves under the Union Jack\". Further agitation began when the practice was outlawed in neighboring [[Kwangtung|Kwantung]] (Guandong) Province the same year. This caused the Anti-Mui Tsai Society to become even more upset about the issue remaining unsolved in their province.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1929, in response to pressure from Anti-Mui Tsai groups, the [[Legislative council|Legislative Council]] passed an amendment stating that Mui Tsai were to be registered and paid wages.<ref name=\":0\" /> The new colonial secretary, Passfield, told Clementi to put Part III of the 1923 ordinance into immediate effect and send six monthly reports on the progress. All Mui Tsai had to be registered before June 1, 1930 and further imports were forbidden. 4,268 girls were registered.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Anti-Mui Tsai Society claimed that fewer than half of the Mui Tsai was actually registered.<ref name=\":0\" /> In July 1931, Passfield appointed a police inspector and two Chinese women inspectors to help register Mui Tsai.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== End of the Anti-Mui Tsai Movement ====\nThe Anti-Mui Tsai Society disbanded in the 1930s.<ref name=\":8\" /> British charitable groups took over its cause and successfully pushed Parliament to enact reforms.<ref name=\":6\" /> Since the conclusion of the Anti-Mui Tsai movement in the 1930s, the political power of the three parties: the colonial government, the Chinese elites (as previously represented by the Kuk), and Chinese Christians (including women) has changed greatly. In April 1938, the Legislative Council passed legislation making it mandatory to register all adopted girls with the secretary for Chinese affairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== International involvement ==\n\n=== Clara and Hugh Haslewood ===\nIn August 1919 Clara Haslewood and her husband Hugh, a retired [[Royal Navy]] lieutenant-commander moved to Hong Kong. In November of the same year, Haslewood wrote several letters criticizing the Mui Tsai system and her writings were published by four newspapers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1913888/helena-may-turns-100-how-exclusive-womens-club-earned-its|title=The Helena May turns 100: how an exclusive women's club earned its place in Hong Kong's history|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref> The attention these letters gained led reactionary governor, Sir [[Reginald Edward Stubbs|Reginald Stubbs]] to have the Admiralty transfer Haslewood's husband.

In 1923, the Female Domestic Service Bill banning the importing and transferring of Mui Tsai was established by the Hong Kong Legislative Council under the British Parliament. In a letter published by the Manchester Guardian in 1929, Churchill was criticized for being unable to fully abolishing the Mui Tsai system.

It follows the story of a wealthy family in 1930s Hong Kong dealing with tensions as feminist activists are pushing for women's rights seeking to rid the idea that men are superior to women. In episode 23 of the drama, a press conference is held where people voice their opposing opinions about the Mui Tsai system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://k-tvb.net/new-series-silver-spoon-sterling-shackles/|title=[New Series]: Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles|date=2012-10-16|work=K for TVB|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Effects of Anti-Mui Tsai Society in other countries ==\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn 1879, the Chief Justice of the Hong Kong Supreme Court wrote that the Mui Tsai system was no different from slavery. The British government still did not take any action. The reason being, they feared it would destabilize Hong Kong society. During the 80 years of the colony's history, no steps were taken to try to abolish. When the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), Hong Kong began forming Human Rights laws around human trafficking. However, the Mui Tsai seemed to be neglected under the law do to the cultural influence of what it means to be Mui Tsai. Often seen as charitable to be Mui Tsai, targeting the system similarly to other forms of human trafficking proved more complex and difficult. Thus, intervention relies more on the anti-Mui Tsai activists and other NGOs. With Hong Kong's anti-human trafficking laws still being discussed in 2018, where Mui Tsai comes in between the current human rights laws and modern slavery acts in Hong Kong remains not entirely clear.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Britain===\n\nThe Mui Tsai system was a commonly occurring issue for Britain when the country had a wide spread empire in the Asiatic regions. In the 1920s human rights was becoming a topic of interest in Great Britain.Policies put in place by [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], targeted social issues in British colonies. British news sources at the time kept mainland Britain updated on the status of Mui Tsai abolitionism in Hong Kong. Through these newspapers, the British public could identify Mui Tsai as a child slavery issue into the 1930s. Soon after, the public would pressure parliament for more higher human rights standards to be placed all around the [[British Empire]]. Mui Tsai was known to be active in the [[British Crown Colony]] in Hong Kong Anti-Mui Tsai still exercises activism in these regions after separation from the British Empire. In 1926, Britain became one of the signatories to the [[1926 Slavery Convention|International Slavery Convention under the League of Nations]]. The Mui Tsai issue soon came under international scrutiny. Sino-British relations still discuss the state of [[human rights in China]] including [[human trafficking]]. However, government dialogue on the remaining Mui Tsai is sparse, and British Anti-Mui Tsai communities seem non existent.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tan Yen Ling |first1=Sarah |title=Mui Tsai in Strait Settlements (Malaya) 1920s-1950s: A Conflict of Law and Definition |journal=Sejarah, No. 26, Bil. 1, Jun 2017,pg 50-71 }}</ref>\n\n===Other Settlements: Macau and Malaysia===\n[[Macau]] initially saw the rise of the Mui Tsai system in the 16th century similarly to mainland China in impoverished situations. Anti-Mui Tsai activism rose after the intervention of the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]]. However, Anti-Mui Tsai Activism became more active in later years when targeting the still existing practices of Mui Tsai and human trafficking in mainland China. The spread of Mui Tsai to other parts of Asia and the world through Chinese diaspora aided in its abolition, and in raising the awareness of the wider issue of child welfare.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leow |first1=Rachel |title='Do you own non-Chinese mui tsai?'

Most early Chinese immigrants to the United States borrowed money from their relatives and used the bulk of their savings at home for their journey. Although some had communities to work and make money in, poverty was not at all uncommon in early Chinese American communities. This environment of poor and [[culture shock]]ed Chinese immigrants made a breeding ground for the Mui tsai system. Interest and activism for human rights was not very evident at the time of the Mui Tsai system's American start, especially in immigrant communities. Human rights as a topic in America would not take off until the 1900s leaving Mui Tsai out of public common knowledge. These Immigrant communities had little to no access to education and political voice, hindering their ability to bring Mui Tsai and systematic slavery with in their communities into public eye if so desired. Also, activists within other areas, such as feminism, would struggle to understand and communicate with communities still practicing Mui Tsai into the 20th century.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The overall cultural attitude within Mui Tsai practicing communities would isolate the issue from intervention. When both Christians and Protestants began targeting Mui Tsai in San Francisco, the issue of this kind of child slavery<ref>{{cite book |last1=Philips |first1=E. C. |title=Peeps into China: or the missionary's children. |date=1882 |publisher=London: Cassell |page=(Newlyweds engraving, p. 185.) }}</ref> became more recognized by non-Chinese American communities. Into the late 1900s Chinese American communities and people gained better socioeconomic status, weakening the tradition as 2nd and 3rd generation Chinese Americans would not carry on the system and tradition. Today the Anti Mui Tsai Activism and human trafficking reaches the United States in international human rights discussion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wordie |first1=Jason |title=Then & now: slaves to tradition |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1048517/then-now-slaves-tradition |website=South China Morning Post |publisher=Post Magazine |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Current issues ==\n\nAlthough the Mui Tsai question has been dealt with through legislation, some of the issues are still current. The courts frequently hear cases of cruelty to domestic helpers, punished by employers who still believe their maids belong to them. There are elderly women alive in Hong Kong who were sold into servitude as infants. While this was mostly done out of desperate poverty, deeply seated cultural prejudices against girls also played a key role. Despite the introduction of legal safeguards for women on the mainland in the 20s, and massive advance since, attitudes towards women in rural areas remain primitive. According to reports, rural midwives continue to drown female infants at birth on the instructions of mothers-in-law. Orphanages these days are also mostly filled with girls who one would have been sold as mui tsai.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Case Reports===\nAn 11-year-old girl was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital in April 2005 for evaluation of suspected child abuse. From the age of 8, she had been working in the home of her relatives to scrape a living for her family. At 10 years old, she was sent to Hong Kong to stay with her aunt on a visitor's visa. Her parents were able to receive money as financial relief. However, the aunt did not allow the child to telephone or go back home even after her visitor's visa expired. The child worked as a servant in the aunt's home. She was forced to sleep on the floor and had meals after everyone else was finished. The child had to prepare meals, wash dishes, do laundry, shop for food, clean furniture, and mop the floor. She was given no rest breaks and was subject to physical punishments. Punishments included kicking and beating with a slipper, pricking with a pair of pliers, and spanking with a rod. Despite her injuries, she was never given any medical attention. The child's repeated injuries soon attracted the attention of a supermarket staff and the staff finally decided to report the case to the police.\n\nThis report bears a remarkable resemblance to that of a Mui Tsai. The girl was transferred from a poor family in Mainland China into Hong Kong for servitude following a financial transaction. However, this case was distinguished from previous accounts of Mui Tsai because there was a blood tie between the mistress and servant. Moreover, the child travelled to Hong Kong with valid documents. Therefore, the perpetrator was not charged.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Charles Frederick |title=Chinese Slavery in America |pages= 288\u2013294 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Mui Tsai system is no longer accepted, many of the factors underlying its development such as poverty and son preference or discriminations against the female gender are still prevalent. With the return of authority over Hong Kong to the People's\u2019 Republic of China in 1997, there has been a closer economic link between the Special Administrative Region and the Mainland. Furthermore, traveling over the borders has been made easier. As a result, such changes may have facilitated the emergence of new forms of child victimization in Hong Kong. Child abuse crossing the Hong Kong-China border presents new challenges since offenses committed outside the Special Administrative Region are not under Hong Kong jurisdiction. Therefore, investigation of suspected abuse case is often incomplete or impossible. To make matters worse, children who are residents of the Mainland will be repatriated and there are no formal channels for the follow-up of the victims and their families. The social services provided by no -government organization in Mainland china offer a possible way for child protection agencies in Hong Kong to monitor the wellbeing of the victims, but the effectiveness of this kind of monitoring is still uncertain<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Mui tsai|Mui Tsai]]\n* ''[[Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n", "text_old": "'''Anti-Mui Tsai Activism''' is efforts to abolish the [[Mui tsai|Mui Tsai]] system.

In 1917, the Mui Tsai issue reemerged because of a legal case involving two Mui Tsai who had been kidnapped. A British member of Parliament who happened to be passing though town took the case to the Colonial Office. He questioned how slavery could not only be tolerated but could even be protected by law in the British Empire.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there was an increased interest in social welfare.

The Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign had three main differences from that of the 1880s. It focused more on the system itself rather than prostitution. This time, the campaign had help from different places: British women in Hong Kong, small groups of local Chinese members of Parliament in Britain, religious leaders, and international women's groups. The [[Colonial Office]] started to receive complaints from these groups.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Anti-Mui Tsai Society ===\nIn July 1921, there was a meeting held at the Tai Ping Theatre and The Society for the Protection of Mui Tsai was created by local elites. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society was formed after the meeting in opposition. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society wrote a manifesto following the meeting. The manifesto states that the system was injurious to public morality, it was subversive of righteousness, and it was damaging to the national body (''dasun guoti''). The manifesto mentioned that representatives of Europe and America had met in Berlin in 1885 and outlawed the slave trade. Therefore, it would be damaging to the Chinese national body to continue such trade within or outside the country.\n\nThe Anti-Mui Tsai Society was dissatisfied with reform since it could not remove the root cause of the problem.<ref name=\":6\" /> Revelations by the Anti-Mui Tsai Society about the ongoing abuse of Mui Tsai caused international observers to become interested in the issue.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Towards a Global History of Domestic and Caregiving Workers|last=Hoerder|first=Dirk|publisher=Brill|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=429\u2013448}}</ref> They received backing from local groups such as the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] and was able to gain support from the foreign community and many labor unions.

The chairman of the Chinese Seamen's Union participated and showed willingness to adopt the Mui Tsai question as a labor issue. The Female Domestic Service Ordinance was passed in 1923. The Mui Tsai issue reemerged after the Canton government abolished all forms of slavery in March 1927. In October 1928, the Anti-Mui Tsai Society declared that conditions had become worse since 1923 and sent details to groups in Britain. The bill ended up doing very little, except mainly to prohibit any new Mui Tsai transactions and domestic service for girls under ten years of age.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the secretary of the [[Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society|Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society]] learned about the situation, letters were written to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' that was soon published. Many British activists who had been involved in the campaign in the early 1920s resurfaced. They distributed articles with titles such as \"Little Yellow Slaves under the Union Jack\". Further agitation began when the practice was outlawed in neighboring [[Kwangtung|Kwantung]] (Guandong) Province the same year. This caused the Anti-Mui Tsai Society to become even more upset about the issue remaining unsolved in their province.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1929, in response to pressure from Anti-Mui Tsai groups, the [[Legislative council|Legislative Council]] passed an amendment stating that Mui Tsai were to be registered and paid wages.<ref name=\":0\" /> The new colonial secretary, Passfield, told Clementi to put Part III of the 1923 ordinance into immediate effect and send six monthly reports on the progress.

In episode 23 of the drama, a press conference is held where people voice their opposing opinions about the Mui Tsai system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://k-tvb.net/new-series-silver-spoon-sterling-shackles/|title=[New Series]: Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles|date=2012-10-16|work=K for TVB|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Effects of Anti-Mui Tsai Society in other countries ==\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn 1879, the Chief Justice of the Hong Kong Supreme Court wrote that the Mui Tsai system was no different from slavery. The British government still did not take any action. The reason being, they feared it would destabilize Hong Kong society. During the 80 years of the colony's history, no steps were taken to try to abolish. When the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), Hong Kong began forming Human Rights laws around human trafficking. However, the Mui Tsai seemed to be neglected under the law do to the cultural influence of what it means to be Mui Tsai. Often seen as charitable to be Mui Tsai, targeting the system similarly to other forms of human trafficking proved more complex and difficult. Thus, intervention relies more on the anti-Mui Tsai activists and other NGOs. With Hong Kong's anti-human trafficking laws still being discussed in 2018, where Mui Tsai comes in between the current human rights laws and modern slavery acts in Hong Kong remains not entirely clear.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Britain===\n\nThe Mui Tsai system was a commonly occurring issue for Britain when the country had a wide spread empire in the Asiatic regions. In the 1920s human rights was becoming a topic of interest in Great Britain.Policies put in place by [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], targeted social issues in British colonies. British news sources at the time kept mainland Britain updated on the status of Mui Tsai abolitionism in Hong Kong. Through these newspapers, the British public could identify Mui Tsai as a child slavery issue into the 1930s. Soon after, the public would pressure parliament for more higher human rights standards to be placed all around the [[British Empire]]. Mui Tsai was known to be active in the [[British Crown Colony]] in Hong Kong Anti-Mui Tsai still exercises activism in these regions after separation from the British Empire. In 1926, Britain became one of the signatories to the [[1926 Slavery Convention|International Slavery Convention under the League of Nations]]. The Mui Tsai issue soon came under international scrutiny. Sino-British relations still discuss the state of [[human rights in China]] including [[human trafficking]]. However, government dialogue on the remaining Mui Tsai is sparse, and British Anti-Mui Tsai communities seem non existent.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tan Yen Ling |first1=Sarah |title=Mui Tsai in Strait Settlements (Malaya) 1920s-1950s: A Conflict of Law and Definition |journal=Sejarah, No. 26, Bil. 1, Jun 2017,pg 50-71 }}</ref>\n\n===Other Settlements: Macau and Malaysia===\n[[Macau]] initially saw the rise of the Mui Tsai system in the 16th century similarly to mainland China in impoverished situations. Anti-Mui Tsai activism rose after the intervention of the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]]. However, Anti-Mui Tsai Activism became more active in later years when targeting the still existing practices of Mui Tsai and human trafficking in mainland China. The spread of Mui Tsai to other parts of Asia and the world through Chinese diaspora aided in its abolition, and in raising the awareness of the wider issue of child welfare.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leow |first1=Rachel |title='Do you own non-Chinese mui tsai?'

Most early Chinese immigrants to the United States borrowed money from their relatives and used the bulk of their savings at home for their journey. Although some had communities to work and make money in, poverty was not at all uncommon in early Chinese American communities. This environment of poor and [[culture shock]]ed Chinese immigrants made a breeding ground for the Mui tsai system. Interest and activism for human rights was not very evident at the time of the Mui Tsai system's American start, especially in immigrant communities. Human rights as a topic in America would not take off until the 1900s leaving Mui Tsai out of public common knowledge. These Immigrant communities had little to no access to education and political voice, hindering their ability to bring Mui Tsai and systematic slavery with in their communities into public eye if so desired. Also, activists within other areas, such as feminism, would struggle to understand and communicate with communities still practicing Mui Tsai into the 20th century.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The overall cultural attitude within Mui Tsai practicing communities would isolate the issue from intervention. When both Christians and Protestants began targeting Mui Tsai in San Francisco, the issue of this kind of child slavery<ref>{{cite book |last1=Philips |first1=E. C. |title=Peeps into China: or the missionary's children. |date=1882 |publisher=London: Cassell |page=(Newlyweds engraving, p. 185.) }}</ref> became more recognized by non-Chinese American communities. Into the late 1900s Chinese American communities and people gained better socioeconomic status, weakening the tradition as 2nd and 3rd generation Chinese Americans would not carry on the system and tradition. Today the Anti Mui Tsai Activism and human trafficking reaches the United States in international human rights discussion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wordie |first1=Jason |title=Then & now: slaves to tradition |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1048517/then-now-slaves-tradition |website=South China Morning Post |publisher=Post Magazine |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Current issues ==\n\nAlthough the Mui Tsai question has been dealt with through legislation, some of the issues are still current. The courts frequently hear cases of cruelty to domestic helpers, punished by employers who still believe their maids belong to them. There are elderly women alive in Hong Kong who were sold into servitude as infants. While this was mostly done out of desperate poverty, deeply seated cultural prejudices against girls also played a key role. Despite the introduction of legal safeguards for women on the mainland in the 20s, and massive advance since, attitudes towards women in rural areas remain primitive. According to reports, rural midwives continue to drown female infants at birth on the instructions of mothers-in-law. Orphanages these days are also mostly filled with girls who one would have been sold as mui tsai.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Case Reports===\nAn 11-year-old girl was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital in April 2005 for evaluation of suspected child abuse. From the age of 8, she had been working in the home of her relatives to scrape a living for her family. At 10 years old, she was sent to Hong Kong to stay with her aunt on a visitor's visa. Her parents were able to receive money as financial relief. However, the aunt did not allow the child to telephone or go back home even after her visitor's visa expired. The child worked as a servant in the aunt's home. She was forced to sleep on the floor and had meals after everyone else was finished. The child had to prepare meals, wash dishes, do laundry, shop for food, clean furniture, and mop the floor. She was given no rest breaks and was subject to physical punishments. Punishments included kicking and beating with a slipper, pricking with a pair of pliers, and spanking with a rod. Despite her injuries, she was never given any medical attention. The child's repeated injuries soon attracted the attention of a supermarket staff and the staff finally decided to report the case to the police.\n\nThis report bears a remarkable resemblance to that of a Mui Tsai. The girl was transferred from a poor family in Mainland China into Hong Kong for servitude following a financial transaction. However, this case was distinguished from previous accounts of Mui Tsai because there was a blood tie between the mistress and servant. Moreover, the child travelled to Hong Kong with valid documents. Therefore, the perpetrator was not charged.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Charles Frederick |title=Chinese Slavery in America |pages= 288\u2013294 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Mui Tsai system is no longer accepted, many of the factors underlying its development such as poverty and son preference or discriminations against the female gender are still prevalent. With the return of authority over Hong Kong to the People's\u2019 Republic of China in 1997, there has been a closer economic link between the Special Administrative Region and the Mainland. Furthermore, traveling over the borders has been made easier. As a result, such changes may have facilitated the emergence of new forms of child victimization in Hong Kong. Child abuse crossing the Hong Kong-China border presents new challenges since offenses committed outside the Special Administrative Region are not under Hong Kong jurisdiction. Therefore, investigation of suspected abuse case is often incomplete or impossible. To make matters worse, children who are residents of the Mainland will be repatriated and there are no formal channels for the follow-up of the victims and their families. The social services provided by no -government organization in Mainland china offer a possible way for child protection agencies in Hong Kong to monitor the wellbeing of the victims, but the effectiveness of this kind of monitoring is still uncertain<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Mui tsai|Mui Tsai]]\n* ''[[Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Typo fixing, replaced: passing though  \u2192  passing through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Mui_Tsai_Activism"}

It was a light truck with a Renault Master&nbsp;I body on a separate chassis, rear wheel drive and rear dual wheels.\n\nThe B series was offered with a range of alternative body options.

They traded goods and formed social ties among the three islands despite the long canoe voyages between them, which helped the small populations on each island survive despite their limited resources. Eventually, important natural resources were exhausted, inter-island trade broke down and a period of civil war began on Mangareva, causing the small human populations on Henderson and Pitcairn to be cut off and eventually become extinct.\n\nAlthough archaeologists believe that Polynesians were living on Pitcairn as late as the 15th century,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} the islands were uninhabited when they were rediscovered by Europeans.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collapse: how societies choose to fail or succeed |first=Jared M |last=Diamond |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|Penguin]] |location=New York |isbn=9780143036555 |oclc=62868295 |page=[https://archive.org/details/collapse00jare/page/132 132] |quote=But by A.D. 1606 . . .

The inhabitants of the island were well aware of the ''Bounty's'' location, which is still visible underwater in [[Bounty Bay]], but the wreckage gained significant attention in 1957 when documented by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' explorer [[Luis Marden]]. Although the settlers survived by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among them. [[Alcoholism]], [[murder]], disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and Tahitian men. [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]] and [[Ned Young]] turned to the [[Religious text|scriptures]], using the ship's [[Bounty Bible|Bible]] as their guide for a new and peaceful society. Young eventually died of an [[asthma]]tic infection.\n\nDucie Island was rediscovered in 1791 by [[Royal Navy]] captain Edwards aboard {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, while searching for the ''Bounty'' mutineers. He named it after [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie]], also a captain in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Pitcairn islanders reported it was not until 27 December 1795 that the first ship since the ''Bounty'' was seen from the island, but it did not approach the land and they could not make out the nationality. A second ship appeared in 1801, but made no attempt to communicate with them. A third came sufficiently near to see their house, but did not try to send a boat on shore. Finally, the American [[seal hunting|sealing]] ship ''Topaz'', under [[Mayhew Folger]], became the first to visit the island, when the crew spent 10 hours on Pitcairn in February 1808. Whalers subsequently became regular visitors to the island. The last recorded whaler to visit was the ''James Arnold'' in 1888.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripst Bureau, p.207. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A view of Pitcairn's Island, South Seas, 1814, J.

[[Spiny lobster]] and a large variety of fish are caught for meals and for trading aboard passing ships. Almost every day someone will go fishing, whether it is from the rocks, from a longboat, or diving with a spear gun. There are numerous types of fish around the island. Fish such as nanwee, white fish, moi, and opapa are caught in shallow water, white snapper, big eye, and cod are caught in deep water, and yellow tail and wahoo are caught by trawling.\n\n=== Minerals ===\nManganese, iron, copper, gold, silver and zinc have been discovered within the [[exclusive economic zone]], which extends {{convert|370|km|abbr=on}} offshore and comprises {{convert|880000|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Commonwealth Secretariat |author2=Rupert Jones-Parry |title=The Commonwealth Yearbook 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhYARwAACAAJ |year=2010 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |isbn=9780956306012 |chapter=Pitcairn Economy}}</ref>\n\n=== Honey production ===\nIn 1998 the UK's overseas aid agency, the [[Department for International Development]], funded an [[apiculture]] programme for Pitcairn which included training for Pitcairn's [[beekeeper]]s and a detailed analysis of Pitcairn's bees and honey with particular regard to the presence or absence of disease.

Eventually, important natural resources were exhausted, inter-island trade broke down and a period of civil war began on Mangareva, causing the small human populations on Henderson and Pitcairn to be cut off and eventually become extinct.\n\nAlthough archaeologists believe that Polynesians were living on Pitcairn as late as the 15th century,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} the islands were uninhabited when they were rediscovered by Europeans.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collapse: how societies choose to fail or succeed |first=Jared M |last=Diamond |author-link=Jared Diamond |date=2005 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|Penguin]] |location=New York |isbn=9780143036555 |oclc=62868295 |page=[https://archive.org/details/collapse00jare/page/132 132] |quote=But by A.D. 1606 . . .

The inhabitants of the island were well aware of the ''Bounty's'' location, which is still visible underwater in [[Bounty Bay]], but the wreckage gained significant attention in 1957 when documented by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' explorer [[Luis Marden]]. Although the settlers survived by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among them. [[Alcoholism]], [[murder]], disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and Tahitian men. [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]] and [[Ned Young]] turned to the [[Religious text|scriptures]], using the ship's [[Bounty Bible|Bible]] as their guide for a new and peaceful society. Young eventually died of an [[asthma]]tic infection.\n\nDucie Island was rediscovered in 1791 by [[Royal Navy]] captain Edwards aboard {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, while searching for the ''Bounty'' mutineers. He named it after [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie]], also a captain in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Pitcairn islanders reported it was not until 27 December 1795 that the first ship since the ''Bounty'' was seen from the island, but it did not approach the land and they could not make out the nationality. A second ship appeared in 1801, but made no attempt to communicate with them. A third came sufficiently near to see their house, but did not try to send a boat on shore. Finally, the American [[seal hunting|sealing]] ship ''Topaz'', under [[Mayhew Folger]], became the first to visit the island, when the crew spent 10 hours on Pitcairn in February 1808. Whalers subsequently became regular visitors to the island. The last recorded whaler to visit was the ''James Arnold'' in 1888.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripst Bureau, p.207. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A view of Pitcairn's Island, South Seas, 1814, J.

The Governor and the Island Council may enact laws for the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" of Pitcairn. The [[Island Council (Pitcairn)|Island Council]] customarily appoints a [[List of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands|Mayor of Pitcairn]] as a day-to-day head of the local administration.

However some Manx is used to a very limited extent in official publications, street signs etc., and education in the Manx language is offered in schools. The Manx language knowledge of most people on the island is limited to a few words.\n\nHistorically, [[Old Norse]] was a North Germanic language spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and their overseas settlements, including the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], from about the 9th to the 13th centuries. Many place names on the Isle of Man have Old Norse derivations.\n\n==History and politics==\n{{Main|History of the Isle of Man|Politics of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man Government}}\nThe Isle of Man is one of the six [[Celtic nations]], and has been under [[Norsemen|Norse]], Scottish and English control for much of the past thousand years.\n\nThe earliest traces of people in the Isle of Man date to around 8000 BC, during the [[Mesolithic]] Period, also known as the Middle Stone Age.

By 4000 BC, people once reliant upon the uncultivated natural resources of the land and sea had adopted cereal growing and stock rearing, using imported species of grain and animals.

Based on inscriptions, the inhabitants appear to have used a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] language; however, at some point, possibly c. 700 AD, it is assumed that Irish invasion or immigration formed the basis of a new culture, and the Manx came to speak Gaelic.

The [[Norsemen|Norse]] had a major impact on the island, leaving behind Norse placenames, and influencing its distinctive political system, [[Tynwald]] (from [[Old Norse]], ''\u00deingv\u00f3llr''), which is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world.\n\nIn 1266, under the [[Treaty of Perth]], Norway's King [[Magnus VI]] ceded the isles to [[Scotland]]. For more than a century the Isle of Man, during the Anglo-Scottish wars, passed between Scotland and England. During this troubled period the Island was captured by the Scottish army of Robert the Bruce in 1313. Later in the 14th century, when England once more seized the Island, the Lordship \u2013 indeed kingship \u2013 was given to the Montacute family, Earls of Salisbury.\n\nIn 1405, the Lordship was granted to Sir John Stanley, whose descendants (later the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]]) ruled the Isle of Man for over 300 years. The lordship passed through a female line to the [[Duke of Atholl|Dukes of Atholl]] in 1736, and was eventually [[History of the Isle of Man#Revestment|purchased by the British Crown]] in 1765.\n\nSince 1866, when the Isle of Man obtained a measure of [[home rule]], the Manx people have developed into a modern nation with an economy based decreasingly on agriculture and fishing and increasingly first on tourism and then on financial and other services.\n\nThe 20th century saw a revival of interest in Manx music and dance, and in the [[Manx language]], though the last native (first language) speaker of Manx died in the 1970s. In the middle of the 20th century, the [[Taoiseach]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] visited, and was so distressed at the lack of support for Manx that he immediately had two recording vans sent over to record the language before it disappeared completely.\n\nAs the century progressed, the Manx tourist economy declined, first because of the effects of the two world wars and later as tourists began to take advantage of cheaper air travel to take European [[package holiday]]s. The Manx government responded in the 1960s by promoting the island as an [[offshore financial centre]]. While this has had beneficial effects on the Manx economy, it has had its detractors, who have pointed to negative aspects such as the effects on local house prices, and perhaps also [[money laundering]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The economic changes gave a short-lived impetus to Manx nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s, spawning [[Mec Vannin]], a nationalist group, as well as the now-defunct [[Manx National Party]] and {{lang|gv|[[Fo Halloo]]}} (\"Underground\"), which mounted a direct-action campaign of spray-painting and house-burning. Nationalist politics has since declined and a number of its former proponents are now in mainstream politics.\n\nThe 1990s and early 21st century have seen a greater recognition of indigenous Manx culture, such as the first Manx-medium primary school, though Manx culture still remains on the margins of popular culture for the majority of Manx residents.\n\n===Manx political parties===\nMost Manx politicians are independents rather than [[List of political parties in the Isle of Man|party members]].
