He directed U.S. foreign policy for much of the 1780s and was an important leader of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] after the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nJay was born into a wealthy family of merchants and New York City government officials of [[French Americans|French]] and [[Dutch Americans|Dutch descent]]. He became a lawyer and joined the New York Committee of Correspondence, organizing opposition to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policies in the time preceding the [[American Revolution]]. Jay was elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], and served as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of the Congress]]. From 1779 to 1782, Jay served as the [[United States Ambassador to Spain|ambassador to Spain]]; he persuaded Spain to provide financial aid to the fledgling United States. He also served as a negotiator of the Treaty of Paris, in which Britain recognized American independence. Following the end of the war, Jay served as [[United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]], directing United States foreign policy under the [[Articles of Confederation]] government. He also served as the first [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] on an interim basis.\n\nA proponent of strong, centralized government, Jay worked to ratify the United States Constitution in New York in 1788. He was a co-author of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' along with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], and wrote five of the 85 essays. After the establishment of the new federal government, Jay was appointed by President [[George Washington]] the first Chief Justice of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1795. The [[Jay Court]] experienced a light workload, deciding just four cases over six years. In 1794, while serving as Chief Justice, Jay negotiated the highly controversial [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain. Jay received a handful of [[List of people who received an electoral vote in the United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] in three of the first four presidential elections, but never undertook a serious bid for the presidency.\n\nJay served as the [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1795 to 1801. Long an opponent of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], he helped enact a law that provided for the gradual emancipation of slaves, and the institution of slavery [[abolitionism in the United States|was abolished]] in New York in Jay's lifetime. In the waning days of President [[John Adams]]'s administration, Jay was confirmed by the Senate for another term as Chief Justice, but he declined the position and retired to his farm in [[Westchester County, New York]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Family history===\nThe Jays were a prominent merchant family in New York City, descended from [[Huguenot]]s who had come to New York to escape religious persecution in France. In 1685, the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes|Edict of Nantes had been revoked]], thereby abolishing the rights of [[Protestant]]s and the Crown confiscated their property. Among those affected was Jay's [[paternal]] grandfather, Auguste Jay. He moved from France to Charleston, South Carolina and then New York, where he built a successful merchant empire.<ref>Pellew, George: \"American Statesman John Jay\", p. 1.

These same children would be required to serve the mother's owner until age 28 for males and age 25 for females, years beyond the typical period of indenture.

''The Rye Record,'' December 7, 2014.</ref>\n\n====Film and television====\nJay was portrayed by Tim Moyer in the 1984 TV miniseries ''[[George Washington (miniseries)|George Washington]]''. In its 1986 sequel miniseries, ''[[George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation]]'', he was portrayed by Nicholas Kepros.\n\n===Notable descendants===\nJay had six children, including [[Peter Augustus Jay (lawyer)|Peter Augustus Jay]] and abolitionist [[William Jay (jurist)|William Jay]].  In later generations, Jay's descendants included physician [[John Clarkson Jay]] (1808\u20131891), lawyer and diplomat [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]] (1817\u20131894), Colonel [[William Jay (Colonel)|William Jay]] (1841\u20131915), diplomat [[Peter Augustus Jay (diplomat)|Peter Augustus Jay]] (1877\u20131933), writer [[John Jay Chapman]] (1862\u20131933), banker [[Pierre Jay]] (1870\u20131949), horticulturalist [[Mary Rutherfurd Jay]] (1872\u20131953), and academic [[John Jay Iselin]] (1933\u20132008). Jay was also a direct ancestor of [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] (1909\u20131944), a resistance fighter against Nazism.\n\n= Musical Career =\nAlthough relatively little is known about John Jay's musical career, he is considered to be the father of modern rhythm and blues music. He released his first single, \"The Cosmic Boogie That Sings in Your Soul\" in 1766. Sadly, all that is known about the piece is the title, as every one of the five-hundred copies made was destroyed for having \"sinful rhythms that encouraged girls undress themselves\" and \"lyrics that could only have been written by Satan himself.\" After seeing the poor critical reception and wax effigies of himself being burned in the streets, John Jay took a break from releasing music, pursuing it only as a private hobby. \n\nThirty years later, shortly after leaving office, John Jay released one last musical project. It was a four track long EP entitled \"Too Fly to Ever Come Down\" which received even worse critical reception, Metacritic giving it only a seven out of one hundred, and ten times the burnt effigies. The sheet music for the song, \"Life (of the Party,) Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\" was the only thing to survive the public's wrath. It made use of soulful falsetto, relaxed finger-picking of the electric guitar, airy harpsichord, and an elegant trap beat. It is a staple of R and B music to this day and the original sheet music can be seen in the Smithsonian.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|United States|Politics}}\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States]]\n* [[List of United States Chief Justices by time in office]]\n* [[List of United States Supreme Court cases prior to the Marshall Court]]\n* [[List of United States Supreme Court Justices by time in office]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bemis|first=Samuel F.|title=Jay's Treaty: A Study in Commerce and Diplomacy|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York City|year=1923|isbn=978-0-8371-8133-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/jaystreatystudyi0000bemi}}\n* Bemis, Samuel Flagg. \"John Jay.\" [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106006332446;view=1up;seq=225] in Bemis, ed.

He directed U.S. foreign policy for much of the 1780s and was an important leader of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] after the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nJay was born into a wealthy family of merchants and New York City government officials of [[French Americans|French]] and [[Dutch Americans|Dutch descent]]. He became a lawyer and joined the New York Committee of Correspondence, organizing opposition to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policies in the time preceding the [[American Revolution]]. Jay was elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], and served as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of the Congress]]. From 1779 to 1782, Jay served as the [[United States Ambassador to Spain|ambassador to Spain]]; he persuaded Spain to provide financial aid to the fledgling United States. He also served as a negotiator of the Treaty of Paris, in which Britain recognized American independence. Following the end of the war, Jay served as [[United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]], directing United States foreign policy under the [[Articles of Confederation]] government. He also served as the first [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] on an interim basis.\n\nA proponent of strong, centralized government, Jay worked to ratify the United States Constitution in New York in 1788. He was a co-author of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' along with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], and wrote five of the 85 essays. After the establishment of the new federal government, Jay was appointed by President [[George Washington]] the first Chief Justice of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1795. The [[Jay Court]] experienced a light workload, deciding just four cases over six years. In 1794, while serving as Chief Justice, Jay negotiated the highly controversial [[Jay Treaty]] with Britain. Jay received a handful of [[List of people who received an electoral vote in the United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] in three of the first four presidential elections, but never undertook a serious bid for the presidency.\n\nJay served as the [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1795 to 1801. Long an opponent of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], he helped enact a law that provided for the gradual emancipation of slaves, and the institution of slavery [[abolitionism in the United States|was abolished]] in New York in Jay's lifetime. In the waning days of President [[John Adams]]'s administration, Jay was confirmed by the Senate for another term as Chief Justice, but he declined the position and retired to his farm in [[Westchester County, New York]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Family history===\nThe Jays were a prominent merchant family in New York City, descended from [[Huguenot]]s who had come to New York to escape religious persecution in France. In 1685, the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes|Edict of Nantes had been revoked]], thereby abolishing the rights of [[Protestant]]s and the Crown confiscated their property. Among those affected was Jay's [[paternal]] grandfather, Auguste Jay.

These same children would be required to serve the mother's owner until age 28 for males and age 25 for females, years beyond the typical period of indenture. The law thus defined a type of indentured servant while providing for eventual freedom for children born to slaves. It did not provide government payment of compensation to the owners.

The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

Adult males are entirely black with glossy steel blue sheen, the only swallow in North America with such coloration. Adult females are dark on top with some steel blue sheen, and lighter underparts. Adults have a slightly forked tail. Both male and female purple martins exhibit [[delayed plumage maturation]], meaning it takes them two years before they acquire full adult plumage. Subadult females look similar to adult females minus the steel blue sheen and browner on the back. Subadult males look very much like females, but solid black feathers emerge on their chest in a blotchy, random pattern as they molt to their adult plumage.<ref name = \"Cornell\">{{cite web \n  | first = Charles R.\n  | last = Brown\n  | editor= Purple Martin (Progne subis)\n  | editor2= The Birds of North America Online (A.

In many places, humans put up real or artificial hollow gourds, or houses for martins, especially in the east, where purple martins are almost entirely dependent on such structures. As a result, this subspecies typically breeds in [[Bird colony|colonies]] located in proximity to people, even within cities and towns. This makes their distribution patchy, as they are usually absent from areas where no nest sites are provided. Western birds often make use of natural cavities such as old woodpecker holes in trees or [[saguaro]] cacti.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/><ref name = \"Turner\"/>\n\nThe purple martin [[bird migration|migrates]] to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] basin in winter. Its winter range extends into [[Ecuador]]<ref>[[Guayas Province|Guayas]] and [[Orellana Province]]s: Cisneros-Heredia (2006).</ref> but does not seem to ascend far up the [[Andes|Andean]] foothills.\n\nThe first record of this species in [[Europe]] was a single bird on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Scotland]], on 5\u20136 September 2004, and the second was on the [[Azores]] on 6 September 2004.\n\n==Conservation status==\nPurple martins suffered a severe population crash in the 20th century widely linked to the release and spread of [[European starling]]s in North America. European starlings and [[house sparrow]]s compete with martins for nest cavities. Where purple martins once gathered by the thousands, by the 1980s they had all but disappeared.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Hunn\n  |first = Eugene S.\n  |title = Birding in Seattle and King County\n  |publisher = [[Seattle Audubon Society]]\n  |year = 1982\n  |isbn = 0914516051\n  |pages = 107\u2013108\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is a misconception among many people of purple martin temperament. Many people believe purple martins will defend their nesting sites against competitor species such as the [[house sparrow]] and [[European starling]]. However, both species are more aggressive and in most cases will instinctively fight to the death in order to obtain a nesting site. The house sparrow and European starling are known to kill adult martins, take over the nest and remove eggs or remaining young.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"155px\">\nFile:Progne subis -Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA -nestboxes-8.ogv|Adults around gourds and [[nest box]]es in a garden in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], United States\nFile:Griggsville, Illinois.jpg|Nest boxes in Griggsville, Illinois\n</gallery>Though listed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 with the IUCN<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Purple Martin|last=International)|first=BirdLife International (BirdLife|date=2016-10-01|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>, purple martins are experiencing a unique threat to their long-term survival.

Through years of generational imprinting and nesting the eastern species has made a complete transition from nesting in the wild to relying on human-provided nesting sites. Initially difficult to get a colony started, once established, the colony will persist as long as nesting sites are available. Martins have a very strong \"site tenacity\" and if are successful in raising a brood, will often return to the same site to nest year after year <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chuckspurplemartinpage.com|title=The Purple Martin Progne subis subis|last=Abare|first=Chuck|date=|website=Chuck's Purple Martin Page|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nThe human-avian relationship was in place even before the population crash in the 20th century; The Cherokee Indians were known to have hollowed out the gourds in the pre-colonial era. They erected them so that the adult birds would build nests and then feed thousands of insects to their young each day that would otherwise be eating their crops. In 1808, [[Chickasaw|Chickasaws]] and [[Choctaw|Choctaws]] were observed hanging gourds for martins on stripped saplings near their cabins, as were African Americans on long canes on the banks of the Mississippi<ref name=\":0\" />.   \n\nContinual maintenance and protection is required, as European starlings and house sparrows compete with martins as cavity-nesters, and will fight with martins over nest sites. Thus, unmonitored purple martin houses are often overtaken by more aggressive, non-native species.<ref name=\"Cornell\" /> Purple martin proponents are motivated by the concern that the purple martin would likely vanish from eastern North America were it not for this assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purplemartin.org/main/history.html|title=Purple Martin Conservation Association|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730212222/http://purplemartin.org/main/history.html|archivedate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Migration===\nWintering in Brazil, Bolivia and parts of Peru <ref name=\"Cornell\" />, purple martins migrate to North America in the spring to breed. Spring migration is somewhat staggered, with arrivals in southern areas such as [[Florida]] and [[Texas]] in January, but showing up in the northern United States in April and in [[Canada]] as late as May. \n\nArrival date to the breeding grounds tends to correlate directly with age. It is assumed that the older birds arrive on the breeding grounds first to obtain the better nesting sites. Older males typically migrate first and leave the overwintering sites in late December or early January, followed by older females. Younger birds (first yearlings) typically arrive to the breeding grounds up to two months later <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=E. S.|date=1990|title=The Biological Significance of Age-Specific Return Schedules in Breeding Purple Martins|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/1368740|journal=The Condor|volume=92|pages=1040-1050|via=JSTOR}}</ref>.  \n\nFall migration is also staggered, as birds head south when the breeding season is over. Some birds leave as early as July and others stay as late as October. Martins generally migrate over land, through Mexico and [[Central America]]. When not breeding, martins form large flocks and roost together in great numbers. This behavior begins just prior to the southern migration and continues on the wintering grounds.<ref name=\"Cornell\" />\n\nThese flocks can be so large that when they take-off from these roosts to forage the activity is detected on Doppler radar as rings. Referred to as [[roost rings]], they start small then get larger until the birds have spread out and the ring disappears <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K.R.|date=1998|title=Large-Scale Mapping of Purple Martin Pre-Migratory Roosts Using WSR-88D Weather Surveillance Radar (Mapas a Larga Escala De Los Dormideros Pre-Migratorios De Progne Subis Utilizando Radares WSR-88D Para El Monitoreo Del Clima|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4514321?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume=69|pages=316-325|via=JSTOR}}</ref>.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Progne subis -Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA -eggs and chicks in nestbox-8.jpg|right|thumb|Eggs and small chicks in a nest box in [[Oklahoma]], United States]]\nMales arrive in breeding sites before females, and establish their [[Territory (animal)|territory]]. A territory can consist of several potential nest sites. After forming a pair, both the male and female inspect available nest sites. This process is complicated by the fact that artificial nest sites could be houses with many rooms, clustered gourds, or single gourds. The nest is made inside the cavity of such artificial structures and retains a somewhat flat appearance. The nest is a structure of primarily three levels: the first level acts as a foundation and is usually made up of twigs, mud, small pebbles and in at least a few reported cases, small river mollusk shells were used; the second level of the nest is made up of grasses, finer smaller twigs; the third level of construction composing the nest, is a small compression usually lined with fresh green leaves where the eggs are laid.\n\nPurple martins are generally known to raise only a single brood. The average clutch size is four to six eggs per nest. Females lay one egg a day and incubation begins when the penultimate (second to last) egg is laid. Incubation lasts 15-16 days and the female is the main incubator, with some help from the male. Hatching occurs over the course of two to three days. Fledging, when the young leave the nest, occurs between 26-32 days after hatch day. [[Fledge|Fledglings]] will continue to receive care from both parents for up to a month after fledging. \n\n===Diet===\nPurple martins are [[insectivore]]s, primarily feed by [[Hawking (birds)|hawking]], a strategy of catching insects in the air during flight. The birds are agile hunters and eat a variety of winged insects. Rarely, they will come to the ground to eat insects. They usually fly relatively high, so, contrary to popular opinion, [[mosquito]]es do not form a large part of their diet.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/> Recent research, however, does indicate that the Purple Martin feeds on invasive fire ants ([[Solenopsis invicta]]) and that they may make up a significant portion of their diet.<ref>Helms IV, Jackson A., Bridge, Eli S., Godfrey, Aaron P, and Ames, Tayna.

With an average length of {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a wingspan up to {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}}, they are also the largest amongst the 90 some species in the family [[Hirundinidae]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/Hirundinidae|title=Hirundinidae {{!}} bird family|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Purple martins are [[sexually dimorphic]]. Adult males are entirely black with glossy steel blue sheen, the only swallow in North America with such coloration. Adult females are dark on top with some steel blue sheen, and lighter underparts. Adults have a slightly forked tail. Both male and female purple martins exhibit [[delayed plumage maturation]], meaning it takes them two years before they acquire full adult plumage. Subadult females look similar to adult females minus the steel blue sheen and browner on the back. Subadult males look very much like females, but solid black feathers emerge on their chest in a blotchy, random pattern as they molt to their adult plumage.<ref name = \"Cornell\">{{cite web \n  | first = Charles R.\n  | last = Brown\n  | editor= Purple Martin (Progne subis)\n  | editor2= The Birds of North America Online (A.

She had killed their son to avenge the rape of her sister. The specific ''subis'' is [[Latin]] and refers to a type of bird that breaks eagles\u2019 eggs; it may have been applied to this species because of its aggression towards birds of prey when it is nesting.<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n317 317], 371}}</ref>\n\nThe species of this genus are very closely related, and some view the purple martin, gray-breasted martin, snowy-bellied martin, and southern martin, as a [[superspecies]].<ref name = \"Turner\">\n{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Turner\n  | first1 = Angela K.\n  | last2 = Rose\n  | first2 = Chris\n  | title = Swallows & Martins\n  | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]]\n  | year = 1989\n  | location = Boston\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/swallowsmartinsi00turn/page/7 7, 123\u2013126]\n  | isbn = 0-395-51174-7\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/swallowsmartinsi00turn/page/7\n  }}</ref>\n\n===Subspecies===\n* ''P. s. subis'', is the nominate form, with the typical features of the species, breeds in eastern and mid-western North America.\n* ''P. s. hesperia'' of the [[Mexico]] and the southwestern [[United States]], is distinguished primarily by its nesting habits.\n* ''P. s. arboricola'' of western mountains is large with females paler on underparts.\n\n===Distribution and habitat===\n[[File:Progne subis -fledglings -Tulsa -Oklahoma-8.jpg|left|thumb|Fledglings in Oklahoma, United States]]\nPurple martins' breeding range is throughout temperate North America.<ref>Attenborough, D. ''The Life of Birds.'' 1998. BBC p 297. {{ISBN|0563-38792-0}}</ref> Their breeding [[habitat]] is open areas across eastern North America, and also some locations on the west coast from [[British Columbia]] to [[Mexico]].<ref>See AOU (2000) for details.</ref> Martins make their [[Bird nest|nest]]s in cavities, either natural or artificial. In many places, humans put up real or artificial hollow gourds, or houses for martins, especially in the east, where purple martins are almost entirely dependent on such structures. As a result, this subspecies typically breeds in [[Bird colony|colonies]] located in proximity to people, even within cities and towns. This makes their distribution patchy, as they are usually absent from areas where no nest sites are provided. Western birds often make use of natural cavities such as old woodpecker holes in trees or [[saguaro]] cacti.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/><ref name = \"Turner\"/>\n\nThe purple martin [[bird migration|migrates]] to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] basin in winter. Its winter range extends into [[Ecuador]]<ref>[[Guayas Province|Guayas]] and [[Orellana Province]]s: Cisneros-Heredia (2006).</ref> but does not seem to ascend far up the [[Andes|Andean]] foothills.\n\nThe first record of this species in [[Europe]] was a single bird on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Scotland]], on 5\u20136 September 2004, and the second was on the [[Azores]] on 6 September 2004.\n\n==Conservation status==\nPurple martins suffered a severe population crash in the 20th century widely linked to the release and spread of [[European starling]]s in North America. European starlings and [[house sparrow]]s compete with martins for nest cavities. Where purple martins once gathered by the thousands, by the 1980s they had all but disappeared.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Hunn\n  |first = Eugene S.\n  |title = Birding in Seattle and King County\n  |publisher = [[Seattle Audubon Society]]\n  |year = 1982\n  |isbn = 0914516051\n  |pages = 107\u2013108\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is a misconception among many people of purple martin temperament. Many people believe purple martins will defend their nesting sites against competitor species such as the [[house sparrow]] and [[European starling]]. However, both species are more aggressive and in most cases will instinctively fight to the death in order to obtain a nesting site. The house sparrow and European starling are known to kill adult martins, take over the nest and remove eggs or remaining young.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"155px\">\nFile:Progne subis -Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA -nestboxes-8.ogv|Adults around gourds and [[nest box]]es in a garden in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], United States\nFile:Griggsville, Illinois.jpg|Nest boxes in Griggsville, Illinois\n</gallery>Though listed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 with the IUCN<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Purple Martin|last=International)|first=BirdLife International (BirdLife|date=2016-10-01|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>, purple martins are experiencing a unique threat to their long-term survival. Nearly all eastern species exclusively nest in artificial gourds and \u2018condo\u2019 units provided by human \u2018landlords\u2019. A practice that has been experiencing a steady decline in the number of \u2018landlords\u2019 offering nesting sites. One study found that nearly 90% of landlords were 50 years of age or older, and that younger generations were not exhibiting the same enthusiasm nor possess the resources to provided martin housing for the species.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Jervis|first=L.|date=2019|title=Resisting Extinction: Purple Martins, Death, and the Future|url=|journal=Conservation and Society|volume=17|pages=227-235|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with humans===\nPurple martins (nominate form ''P. s. subis'') are considered [[Synanthrope|synanthropic]], meaning they have developed an association with humans overtime and benefit from living in close proximity to them <ref name=\":0\" />. Through years of generational imprinting and nesting the eastern species has made a complete transition from nesting in the wild to relying on human-provided nesting sites. Initially difficult to get a colony started, once established, the colony will persist as long as nesting sites are available. Martins have a very strong \"site tenacity\" and if are successful in raising a brood, will often return to the same site to nest year after year <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chuckspurplemartinpage.com|title=The Purple Martin Progne subis subis|last=Abare|first=Chuck|date=|website=Chuck's Purple Martin Page|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nThe human-avian relationship was in place even before the population crash in the 20th century; The Cherokee Indians were known to have hollowed out the gourds in the pre-colonial era. They erected them so that the adult birds would build nests and then feed thousands of insects to their young each day that would otherwise be eating their crops. In 1808, [[Chickasaw|Chickasaws]] and [[Choctaw|Choctaws]] were observed hanging gourds for martins on stripped saplings near their cabins, as were African Americans on long canes on the banks of the Mississippi<ref name=\":0\" />.   \n\nContinual maintenance and protection is required, as European starlings and house sparrows compete with martins as cavity-nesters, and will fight with martins over nest sites. Thus, unmonitored purple martin houses are often overtaken by more aggressive, non-native species.<ref name=\"Cornell\" /> Purple martin proponents are motivated by the concern that the purple martin would likely vanish from eastern North America were it not for this assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purplemartin.org/main/history.html|title=Purple Martin Conservation Association|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730212222/http://purplemartin.org/main/history.html|archivedate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Migration===\nWintering in Brazil, Bolivia and parts of Peru <ref name=\"Cornell\" />, purple martins migrate to North America in the spring to breed. Spring migration is somewhat staggered, with arrivals in southern areas such as [[Florida]] and [[Texas]] in January, but showing up in the northern United States in April and in [[Canada]] as late as May. \n\nArrival date to the breeding grounds tends to correlate directly with age. It is assumed that the older birds arrive on the breeding grounds first to obtain the better nesting sites. Older males typically migrate first and leave the overwintering sits in late December or early January, followed by older females. Younger birds (first yearlings) typically arrive to the breeding grounds up to two months later <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=E. S.|date=1990|title=The Biological Significance of Age-Specific Return Schedules in Breeding Purple Martins|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/1368740|journal=The Condor|volume=92|pages=1040-1050|via=JSTOR}}</ref>.  \n\nFall migration is also staggered, as birds head south when the breeding season is over. Some birds leave as early as July and others stay as late as October. Martins generally migrate over land, through Mexico and [[Central America]]. When not breeding, martins form large flocks and roost together in great numbers. This behavior begins just prior to the southern migration and continues on the wintering grounds.<ref name=\"Cornell\" />\n\nThese flocks can be so large that when they take-off from these roosts to forage the activity is detected on Doppler radar as rings. Referred to as [[roost rings]], they start small then get larger until the birds have spread out and the ring disappears <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K.R.|date=1998|title=Large-Scale Mapping of Purple Martin Pre-Migratory Roosts Using WSR-88D Weather Surveillance Radar (Mapas a Larga Escala De Los Dormideros Pre-Migratorios De Progne Subis Utilizando Radares WSR-88D Para El Monitoreo Del Clima|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4514321?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|volume=69|pages=316-325|via=JSTOR}}</ref>.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Progne subis -Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA -eggs and chicks in nestbox-8.jpg|right|thumb|Eggs and small chicks in a nest box in [[Oklahoma]], United States]]\nMales arrive in breeding sites before females, and establish their [[Territory (animal)|territory]]. A territory can consist of several potential nest sites. After forming a pair, both the male and female inspect available nest sites. This process is complicated by the fact that artificial nest sites could be houses with many rooms, clustered gourds, or single gourds. The nest is made inside the cavity of such artificial structures and retains a somewhat flat appearance. The nest is a structure of primarily three levels: the first level acts as a foundation and is usually made up of twigs, mud, small pebbles and in at least a few reported cases, small river mollusk shells were used; the second level of the nest is made up of grasses, finer smaller twigs; the third level of construction composing the nest, is a small compression usually lined with fresh green leaves where the eggs are laid.\n\nPurple martins are generally known to raise only a single brood. The average clutch size is four to six eggs per nest. Females lay one egg a day and incubation begins when the penultimate (second to last) egg is laid. Incubation lasts 15-16 days and the female is the main incubator, with some help from the male. Hatching occurs over the course of two to three days. Fledging, when the young leave the nest, occurs between 26-32 days after hatch day. [[Fledge|Fledglings]] will continue to receive care from both parents for up to a month after fledging. \n\n===Diet===\nPurple martins are [[insectivore]]s, primarily feed by [[Hawking (birds)|hawking]], a strategy of catching insects in the air during flight. The birds are agile hunters and eat a variety of winged insects. Rarely, they will come to the ground to eat insects. They usually fly relatively high, so, contrary to popular opinion, [[mosquito]]es do not form a large part of their diet.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/> Recent research, however, does indicate that the Purple Martin feeds on invasive fire ants ([[Solenopsis invicta]]) and that they may make up a significant portion of their diet.<ref>Helms IV, Jackson A., Bridge, Eli S., Godfrey, Aaron P, and Ames, Tayna.
