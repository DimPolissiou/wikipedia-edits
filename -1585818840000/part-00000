It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], as well as East Asian religions like [[Taoism]]. While [[Bhikkhu|monks]] and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\n\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to [[monastery|monasteries]], where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as {{nihongo||\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406|sh\u014djin ry\u014dri|devotion cuisine}}, and served at many temples, especially in [[Kyoto]]. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the [[\u014cbaku]] school of zen, and known as {{nihongo||\u666e\u8336\u6599\u7406|fucha ry\u014dri}}; this is served at the head temple of [[Manpuku-ji]], as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\n\n==Philosophies governing food== hi im cool\n\n=== Vegetarianism ===\n{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\n\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but not all Buddhist traditions require vegetarianism of lay followers or clergy. Vegetarian eating is primarily associated with the East Asian tradition in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea where it is commonly practiced by clergy and may be observed by laity on holidays or as a devotional practice.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>\n\n[[Theravada]] Monks and nuns traditionally feed themselves by gathering [[alms]], and generally must eat whatever foods are given to them, including meat.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\">{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/vegetarianism.htm |title=Buddhism and Vegetarianism |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |publisher=[[About.com]] }}</ref> The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be [[karma|karmically]] negative, as well as meat from certain animals, such as dogs and snakes, that were regarded as impure in ancient India.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/meat.html |title=What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat |accessdate=June 9, 2012  |publisher=Urban Dharma }}</ref> The same restriction is also followed by some [[laity|lay]] Buddhists and is known as the consumption of \"triply clean meat\" (\u4e09\u51c0\u8089). The [[Pali Sutras]] also describe the Buddha as refusing a suggestion by his student [[Devadatta]] to mandate vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\n\nIn the [[Mahayana]] tradition, by contrast, several sutras of the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana canon]] contain explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, including sections of the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and [[Surangama Sutra]]. [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhist]] sects generally believe that Buddha ate meat.<ref name=\"gfbv\">{{cite web | last = Powers | first = John | title = Going forth: Buddhist vision of vinaya - book review <Internet> | url = http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/739.pdf | accessdate = 16 July 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055359/http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/739.pdf | archivedate = 28 September 2007 }}</ref> All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism ([[Zen]], [[Nichiren]], [[J\u014ddo sh\u016b|Jodo]]) have relaxed Mahayana [[vinaya]], and as a consequence, vegetarianism is optional.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>  The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>\n\n[[Tibetan Buddhism]] has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, many leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practicing vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nBoth [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating [[Bodhisattvas|Bodhisattvas's]] [[paramita]].<ref name=\"aboutbudd\"/><ref name=\"udvagi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/vegi.html |title=Buddhism and Vegetarianism |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |publisher=Urban Dharma }}</ref>\n\n===Other restrictions===\n\nIn addition to the ban on [[garlic]] practically all [[Mahayana]] monastics in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Japan]] specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], mountain [[leek]] and [[Allium chinense]], which together with garlic are referred to as ''w\u01d4 h\u016bn'' (\u4e94\u8477, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or ''w\u01d4 x\u012bn'' (\u4e94\u8f9b or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the [[Brahamajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahamajala Sutra]], the [[Surangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]], as well as [[coriander]]. The origin of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list.<ref>It also includes coriander and a type of rabe plant.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Shojin ryori ryuanji.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An example of sh\u014djin-ry\u014dri taken in [[Kyoto]], Japan, at the zen temple of [[Ry\u014dan-ji]].]] \nThe food that a strict Buddhist takes, if not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned \"triply clean meat\" rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal innards and organs. This is known as ''xi\u00e0shui'' (\u4e0b\u6c34), not to be confused with the term for sewage.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"[[mindfulness]]\". It is part of the [[Five Precepts]] which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, [[tobacco]] and drugs other than medicine to be addictive.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Although [[caffeine]] is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially [[tea]] are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. <!-- In the probably oldest legend a Chinese emperor adopted is first. --> Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\n\n===Simple and natural===\n\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adopted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\n\nIn ''[[Tenzo kyokun]]'' (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), [[Soto Zen]] founder [[Eihei Dogen]] wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\n\n<blockquote>In preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wwzc.org/book/tenzo-kyokun-instructions-tenzo-0 | title = Tenzo kyokun: Instructions for the Tenzo - White Wind Zen Community | accessdate = 2012-10-15}}</ref>\"</blockquote>\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Saigon Vegetarian food.jpg|thumb|Vegetarian dishes at a Buddhist restaurant in Ho Chi Minh city]]\n\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, [[rice]] features heavily as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or [[congee]] as the usual morning meal. [[Noodle]]s and other grains may often be served as well.  Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, [[soy sauce]] and vegan [[dashi]] figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while [[curry]] and [[T\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a [[tea ceremony]] in the Zen tradition.\n\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], also known as seitan, kao fu (\u70e4\u9eb8) or wheat meat, [[soy]] (such as [[tofu]] or [[tempeh]]), [[agar]], [[konjac|konnyaku]] and other [[plant]] products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined [[meat analogue]]s in the world.  Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own.  With the proper [[seasoning]]s, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\n\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[temple]]s which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months).

It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], as well as East Asian religions like [[Taoism]]. While [[Bhikkhu|monks]] and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\n\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to [[monastery|monasteries]], where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as {{nihongo||\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406|sh\u014djin ry\u014dri|devotion cuisine}}, and served at many temples, especially in [[Kyoto]]. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the [[\u014cbaku]] school of zen, and known as {{nihongo||\u666e\u8336\u6599\u7406|fucha ry\u014dri}}; this is served at the head temple of [[Manpuku-ji]], as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\n\n==Philosophies governing food==\n\n=== Vegetarianism ===\n{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\n\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but not all Buddhist traditions require vegetarianism of lay followers or clergy. Vegetarian eating is primarily associated with the East Asian tradition in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea where it is commonly practiced by clergy and may be observed by laity on holidays or as a devotional practice.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>\n\n[[Theravada]] Monks and nuns traditionally feed themselves by gathering [[alms]], and generally must eat whatever foods are given to them, including meat.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\">{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/vegetarianism.htm |title=Buddhism and Vegetarianism |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |publisher=[[About.com]] }}</ref> The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be [[karma|karmically]] negative, as well as meat from certain animals, such as dogs and snakes, that were regarded as impure in ancient India.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/meat.html |title=What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat |accessdate=June 9, 2012  |publisher=Urban Dharma }}</ref> The same restriction is also followed by some [[laity|lay]] Buddhists and is known as the consumption of \"triply clean meat\" (\u4e09\u51c0\u8089). The [[Pali Sutras]] also describe the Buddha as refusing a suggestion by his student [[Devadatta]] to mandate vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\n\nIn the [[Mahayana]] tradition, by contrast, several sutras of the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana canon]] contain explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, including sections of the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and [[Surangama Sutra]]. [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhist]] sects generally believe that Buddha ate meat.<ref name=\"gfbv\">{{cite web | last = Powers | first = John | title = Going forth: Buddhist vision of vinaya - book review <Internet> | url = http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/739.pdf | accessdate = 16 July 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055359/http://www.ic.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/739.pdf | archivedate = 28 September 2007 }}</ref> All Japanese Kamakura sects of Buddhism ([[Zen]], [[Nichiren]], [[J\u014ddo sh\u016b|Jodo]]) have relaxed Mahayana [[vinaya]], and as a consequence, vegetarianism is optional.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>  The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism.<ref name=\"udvagi\"/>\n\n[[Tibetan Buddhism]] has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, many leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practicing vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nBoth [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating [[Bodhisattvas|Bodhisattvas's]] [[paramita]].<ref name=\"aboutbudd\"/><ref name=\"udvagi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/vegi.html |title=Buddhism and Vegetarianism |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |publisher=Urban Dharma }}</ref>\n\n===Other restrictions===\n\nIn addition to the ban on [[garlic]] practically all [[Mahayana]] monastics in [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Japan]] specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally [[asafoetida]], [[shallot]], mountain [[leek]] and [[Allium chinense]], which together with garlic are referred to as ''w\u01d4 h\u016bn'' (\u4e94\u8477, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or ''w\u01d4 x\u012bn'' (\u4e94\u8f9b or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the [[Brahamajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahamajala Sutra]], the [[Surangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]], as well as [[coriander]]. The origin of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list.<ref>It also includes coriander and a type of rabe plant.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Shojin ryori ryuanji.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An example of sh\u014djin-ry\u014dri taken in [[Kyoto]], Japan, at the zen temple of [[Ry\u014dan-ji]].]] \nThe food that a strict Buddhist takes, if not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned \"triply clean meat\" rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal innards and organs. This is known as ''xi\u00e0shui'' (\u4e0b\u6c34), not to be confused with the term for sewage.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"[[mindfulness]]\". It is part of the [[Five Precepts]] which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, [[tobacco]] and drugs other than medicine to be addictive.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Although [[caffeine]] is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially [[tea]] are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. <!-- In the probably oldest legend a Chinese emperor adopted is first. --> Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\n\n===Simple and natural===\n\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adopted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\n\nIn ''[[Tenzo kyokun]]'' (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), [[Soto Zen]] founder [[Eihei Dogen]] wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\n\n<blockquote>In preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wwzc.org/book/tenzo-kyokun-instructions-tenzo-0 | title = Tenzo kyokun: Instructions for the Tenzo - White Wind Zen Community | accessdate = 2012-10-15}}</ref>\"</blockquote>\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Saigon Vegetarian food.jpg|thumb|Vegetarian dishes at a Buddhist restaurant in Ho Chi Minh city]]\n\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, [[rice]] features heavily as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or [[congee]] as the usual morning meal. [[Noodle]]s and other grains may often be served as well.  Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, [[soy sauce]] and vegan [[dashi]] figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while [[curry]] and [[T\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a [[tea ceremony]] in the Zen tradition.\n\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], also known as seitan, kao fu (\u70e4\u9eb8) or wheat meat, [[soy]] (such as [[tofu]] or [[tempeh]]), [[agar]], [[konjac|konnyaku]] and other [[plant]] products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined [[meat analogue]]s in the world.  Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own.  With the proper [[seasoning]]s, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\n\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[temple]]s which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\n\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days.  To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\n\n== Variations by sect or region ==\n\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the [[Zen]] tradition generally follow a pattern of [[\u014cry\u014dki|\"three bowls\"]] in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or [[congee]]; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad.<ref name=\"FarreyO'Hara2000\">{{cite book|author1=Edward Farrey|author2=Nancy O'Hara|title=3 Bowls: Vegetarian Recipes from an American Zen Buddhist Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAdXsNXVokoC|accessdate=14 October 2012|date=16 May 2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-395-97707-1|page=X}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Buddha's delight]]\n<!--* [[Buddhist dietitian]]-->\n* [[Buddhist ethics]]\n* [[Buddhist vegetarianism]]\n* [[Cultural elements of Buddhism]]\n* [[Index of Buddhism-related articles]]\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Secular Buddhism]]\n* [[Vegetarian cuisine]]\n* [[Vegetarianism and religion]]\n* [[Korean temple cuisine]]\n* [[Kaiseki]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Buddhist cuisine}}\n* [http://www.shabkar.org Shabkar.org: Vegetarianism as a way of life for Buddhists]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/download/pdf/Shojin_Ryori_Culinary_Fundamentals_in_Zen.pdf Shojin Ryori: Vegetarian Cooking]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/tantras/index.htm Tantras on Buddhist food]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/sutras/index.htm Sutras on vegetarianism]\n* [http://www.headcity.com/uptown/bigmouth/hungry/chinese/middle.html Return To The Middle Kingdom: Chinese Vegetarian Eating in East Asia]\n* [http://zecoow.com Toshio Tanahashi]\n* [http://vegetarian-china.info/ vegetarian-china.info]\n\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Vegetarianism|state=expanded}}\n{{Diets}}\n{{cuisines}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buddhist Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Buddhist cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Buddhist culture]]\n[[Category:Buddhism in China]]\n[[Category:Regional cuisines of China]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c6:f705:800:d11:4b2a:bf7:2f93", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cuisine"}

First known as the Marquette University College of Law, the school added a day division to the two predecessors' evening programs. The first dean was [[James Graham Jenkins]], a retired judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In 1916, the first edition of the [[Marquette Law Review]] was published, and in 1923, the college's name was changed to Marquette University Law School. A year later, the school moved into Sensenbrenner Hall. A law review article at the time described the building's interior: \"four large lecture rooms and a large Moot Court room\" and a \"third floor [to] be occupied entirely by the library capable of holding 50,000 volumes.\"<ref>[https://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?prospective/history \"Law School History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615120639/http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?prospective%2Fhistory |date=2011-06-15 }} Marquette University Law School.</ref> The law school became a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] in 1912 and received [[American Bar Association]] approval in 1925. The evening program was suspended in 1924 as part of the accreditation process, and was not restored for decades.\n\nIt was under Dean Robert Boden that the modern law school emerged. He took over as acting dean in June 1965, and served as dean until his death in 1984. During those nearly 20 years, the size of the full-time faculty tripled, the student body nearly doubled, and the law library doubled the size of its collection.<ref name=\"Kircher\">John J.

First known as the Marquette University College of Law, the school added a day division to the two predecessors' evening programs. The first dean was [[James Graham Jenkins]], a retired judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In 1916, the first edition of the [[Marquette Law Review]] was published, and in 1923, the college's name was changed to Marquette University Law School. A year later, the school moved into Sensenbrenner Hall. A law review article at the time described the building's interior: \"four large lecture rooms and a large Moot Court room\" and a \"third floor [to] be occupied entirely by the library capable of holding 50,000 volumes.\"<ref>[https://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?prospective/history \"Law School History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615120639/http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?prospective%2Fhistory |date=2011-06-15 }} Marquette University Law School.</ref> The law school became a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] in 1912 and received [[American Bar Association]] approval in 1925. The evening program was suspended in 1924 as part of the accreditation process, and was not restored for decades.\n\nIt was under Dean Robert Boden that the modern law school emerged. He took over as acting dean in June 1965, and served as dean until his death in 1984. During those nearly 20 years, the size of the full-time faculty tripled, the student body nearly doubled, and the law library doubled the size of its collection.<ref name=\"Kircher\">John J. Kircher, ''Dean Robert F. Boden: A Retrospective,'' 67 ''Marquette Law Review'', pp. xi, xiii (1983).</ref>  Boden also oversaw a significant increase in the physical plant of the law school, making two major additions to Sensenbrenner Hall.<ref name=\"Kircher\"/>  Moreover, in January 1968, the law library moved into the newly constructed Legal Research Center, appended to the west side of Sensenbrenner Hall. The move was managed by Professor Mary Alice Hohmann, the first woman to teach a law course at MULS.<ref>Robert F.

The league comprises both a women's and men's competition and is run by the state's governing body, [[Basketball Western Australia]].\n\nThe league was founded in 1989 after Basketball Western Australia sought to expand their [[Perth]]-based District Competition. The SBL is one of six major state-based semi-professional leagues in Australia and sits under the country's two professional leagues\u2014the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]] and [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Basketball Western Australia#History}}\nThe State Basketball League originated in 1972 as the District Competition. The District Competition was introduced by the [[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation]] (WABF) as an 'elite' competition held on Friday nights, featuring eight [[Perth]]-based associations from the prominent districts of Perth, Swan Districts, Tangney/Willetton, Subiaco, East Perth, Cockburn, Stirling, and Claremont.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pekin|first=Lyndsay|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-6713-0-0-0&sID=160971&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=11037486|title=Time-out for Perry Lakes Stadium|work=SportsTG.com|year=2009|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> In 1986, the competition was rebranded as the \"State League\". This name continued in 1987, but 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in Western Australia was being reconsidered.<ref name=handbook89>{{cite book |year=1989 |title=McDonald's State Basketball League Handbook 1989 |publisher=Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.) |page=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. The [[Perth Wildcats]] had a hugely successful season in 1987\u2014reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals\u2014attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar. In 1988, it was decided to form a '''State Basketball League''' for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible. This meant seeking out private owners and attracting corporate sponsorship, so as to not burden the association.

The league comprises both a women's and men's competition and is run by the state's governing body, [[Basketball Western Australia]].\n\nThe league was founded in 1989 after Basketball Western Australia sought to expand their [[Perth]]-based District Competition. The SBL is one of six major state-based semi-professional leagues in Australia and sits under the country's two professional leagues\u2014the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]] and [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Basketball Western Australia#History}}\nThe State Basketball League originated in 1972 as the District Competition. The District Competition was introduced by the [[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation]] (WABF) as an 'elite' competition held on Friday nights, featuring eight [[Perth]]-based associations from the prominent districts of Perth, Swan Districts, Tangney/Willetton, Subiaco, East Perth, Cockburn, Stirling, and Claremont.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pekin|first=Lyndsay|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-6713-0-0-0&sID=160971&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=11037486|title=Time-out for Perry Lakes Stadium|work=SportsTG.com|year=2009|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> In 1986, the competition was rebranded as the \"State League\". This name continued in 1987, but 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in Western Australia was being reconsidered.<ref name=handbook89>{{cite book |year=1989 |title=McDonald's State Basketball League Handbook 1989 |publisher=Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.) |page=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. The [[Perth Wildcats]] had a hugely successful season in 1987\u2014reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals\u2014attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar. In 1988, it was decided to form a '''State Basketball League''' for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible. This meant seeking out private owners and attracting corporate sponsorship, so as to not burden the association.

Games are played on Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Special weekend blockbusters happen every year, such as Easter Round and Anzac Round, with games often being played on Easter Sunday and [[Anzac Day]].

Other attractions of the day include a Three-Point Shootout during half-time of both the WSBL and MSBL All-Star games.\n\nAround August, the regular season ends. Teams are ranked according to their win/loss ratio. If at the end of the regular season, two or more teams have an identical record, then positions are decided on a head-to-head basis. If they cannot be split after that, then for/against percentage is taken into account.\n\n==Finals==\nThe SBL Finals begins in early August and finishes in early September, with the top eight teams in each competition (WSBL and MSBL) competing for their respective Championship. The first two rounds of the finals structure, the quarter-finals and semi-finals, are played using a best-of-three series. The higher ranked team hosts games one and three (if required), and plays game two away; with an exception being: any playoff series involving Geraldton or Goldfields will be played under the pre-2016 format with the higher ranked team playing away for game one, then home for games two and three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-5011-0-0-0&sID=78732&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=40923925|title=SBL Finals Re-structure|work=SportsTG.com|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, [[Basketball Western Australia]] hosts an SBL Grand Final weekend at [[Bendat Basketball Centre]] to determine the champion teams of the WSBL and MSBL, with the WSBL championship game on the Friday night and the MSBL championship game on the Saturday night.

He is married but has no children. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbour, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two uncaring [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]] pump Mildred's stomach, drain her poisoned blood, and fill her with new blood. After the EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag goes outside and overhears Clarisse and her family talking about the way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society. Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of his wife's near-death. Over the next few days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag each night as he walks home. She tells him about how her simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers and how she is forced to go to therapy for her behavior and thoughts. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes missing. He senses something is wrong.<ref name=koster_p35>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/35 35]|quote=Montag does not realize at first that she is gone, or that he misses her; he simply feels that something is the matter.}}</ref>\n\nIn the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and [[self-immolation|burn herself alive]]. Jarred by the woman's suicide, Montag returns home and hides the stolen book under his pillow. Later, Montag wakes Mildred from her sleep and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. She reveals that Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of \"The Mechanical Hound\", an eight-legged<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/32 32]|quote=The Mechanical Hound is an eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.}}</ref> robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen in hunting book hoarders.\n\nMontag awakens ill the next morning. Mildred tries to care for her husband but finds herself more involved in the \"parlor wall\" entertainment in the living room \u2013 large televisions filling the walls. Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night, and Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall \"family\". Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing his concerns, Beatty recounts the history of how books lost their value and how the firemen were adapted for their current role: over the course of several decades, people began to embrace new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and an ever-quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate short [[attention span]]s while minority groups protested the controversial, outdated content they perceived in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines remained, as these fed into the mainstream population's desire for mindless entertainment). At the same time, advances in technology resulted in nearly all buildings being made out of fireproof materials, and the traditional role of firemen in preventing fires was no longer necessary. The government instead turned the firemen into officers of society's peace of mind: instead of putting out fires they became responsible for starting them, specifically for the purpose of burning books, which were condemned as sources of confusing and depressing thoughts that only complicated people's lives. After an awkward encounter between Mildred and Montag over the book hidden under Montag's pillow, Beatty becomes suspicious and casually adds a passing threat as he leaves, telling Montag that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the next 24 hours. If he refused, the other firemen would come and burn his house down for him. The encounter leaves Montag shaken.\n\nAfter Beatty leaves, Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in the air-conditioning duct in their ceiling. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in the kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal.\n\n===\"The Sieve and the Sand\"===\n\nMontag and Mildred discuss the stolen books, and Mildred refuses to go along with it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He suggests that perhaps the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the \"parlor walls\" that night at Mildred's house.\n\nMontag concedes that Mildred is a lost cause and he will need help to understand the books. He remembers an old man named Faber, an English professor before books were banned, whom he once met in a park. Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the [[Bible]], the book he stole at the woman's house. Once there, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.\n\nAt home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the \"parlor walls\". Not interested in this insipid entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they truly are. Enraged by their idiocy, Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition firemen act out once a year: they find an old book and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite the poem ''[[Dover Beach]]'', causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. At the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book. Mildred's friends leave in disgust, while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom and attempts to kill herself again by overdosing on sleeping pills.\n\nMontag hides his books in the backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible. He finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen. Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. Thus Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds, and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive recklessly in the fire truck to the destination: Montag's house.\n\n===\"Burning Bright\"===\n\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends reported him after what happened the other night. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a [[flamethrower]], but Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and, after Beatty taunts him, Montag burns his boss alive and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. Before he escapes, however, he realizes that Beatty had wanted to die a long time ago and had purposely goaded Montag as well as provided him with a weapon.\n\nMontag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled [[Bibliophiles|book-lovers]] who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another Mechanical Hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. On the road, a speeding car attempts to run him over, but he manages to evade the vehicle, and realizes he almost suffered the same fate as Clarisse. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream. Montag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, led by a man named Granger. Granger shows Montag the ongoing manhunt on a portable battery TV and predicts that \u201cMontag\u201d will be caught within the next few minutes; as predicted, an innocent man is then caught and killed.\n\nThe drifters are all former intellectuals. They have each memorized books should the day arrive that society comes to an end and is forced to rebuild itself anew, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. Granger asks Montag what he has to contribute to the group and Montag finds that he had partially memorized the [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]]. While learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons: the imminent war has begun and ended in the same night. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (including Mildred) is immediately killed. Montag and the group are injured and dirtied, but manage to survive the shockwave.\n\nThe following morning, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes, but explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built so that people can take a long look at themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*'''[[Guy Montag]]''' is the [[protagonist]] and a fireman who presents the dystopian world in which he lives first through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, then as a man in conflict about it, and eventually as someone resolved to be free of it. Through most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes only what he hears.\n*'''Clarisse McClellan''' is a young girl one month short of her 17th birthday who is Montag's neighbor.<ref group=note>Clarisse tells Montag she is \"seventeen and crazy\", later admitting that she will actually be seventeen \"next month\".</ref><ref name=koster_p31>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/31 31]|quote=Montag's new neighbor, the sixteen-year-old Clarisse, appears in only a few scenes at the beginning of the novel.}}</ref> She walks with Montag on his trips home from work.

She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking \"why\" instead of \"how\" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after her first meeting with Montag, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family moved away following her death. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old schoolteacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.\n*'''Mildred \"Millie\" Montag''' is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her \"parlor walls\" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described in the book as \"thin as a [[praying mantis]] from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon.\" Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by reading ''Dover Beach'', and finding herself unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him, and dies when the city is bombed.\n*'''Captain Beatty''' is Montag's boss and the book's main antagonist. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content and contradicting facts and opinions. After attempting to force Montag to burn his house, Montag kills him with a flamethrower, only to later realize that Beatty had given him the flamethrower and goaded him on purpose so that Montag would kill him. However, it is still unclear whether or not Beatty was ever on Montag's side, or if he was just suicidal. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for the ''Fahrenheit 451'' play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.\n*'''Stoneman '''and '''Black''' are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function only to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they are told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently realizes how damaging it is to society. Black is later framed by Montag for possessing books.\n*'''Faber''' is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. He secretly communicates with Montag through an electronic ear-piece and helps Montag escape the city, then gets on a bus to [[St. Louis]] and escapes the city himself before it is bombed. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, [[Faber-Castell]].\n*'''Mrs. Ann Bowles '''and '''Mrs. Clara Phelps''' are Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic mainstream society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice-married single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads ''Dover Beach'' to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading \"silly awful hurting words\".\n*'''Granger''' is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.\n\n==Title==\n\nThe title page of the book explains the title as follows: ''Fahrenheit 451\u2014The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns...''.

Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]], he was concerned about [[censorship in the United States]]. During a radio interview in 1956,<ref>{{cite web |others=Narrated by Norman Rose |title=Ticket to the Moon (tribute to SciFi) |date=December 4, 1956 |website=Biography in Sound |publisher=NBC Radio News |url=https://oldradioprograms.us/My%20Old%20Radio%20Shows/B/Biographies%20In%20Sound/Biographies%20In%20Sound%20(NBC)-1956-12-04-Ticket%20To%20The%20Moon%20-%20Tribute%20To%20Scifi.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |at=27:10\u201327:57}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Definitive Biography in Sound Radio Log|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Biography-In-Sound.html|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Bradbury said:<blockquote>I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.</blockquote>\n\nAs time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of ''Fahrenheit 451'' were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:<blockquote>In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was ''not'' fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960). Bradbury directly foretells this incident early in the work: \"And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talking coming in.\" p.12</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis story echoes Mildred's \"Seashell ear-thimbles\" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that ''Fahrenheit 451'' is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature.<ref name=LAweekly>{{cite web|title=Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted|last=Johnston|first=Amy E.

And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, [[Mattachine]]/[[Four Square Gospel]] feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse.&nbsp;[...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever.&nbsp;[...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at [[Ballantine Books]], fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. [[Judy-Lynn del Rey]], one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury|date=2003|title=Fahrenheit 451|edition=50th anniversary|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-34296-8|pages=175\u201379}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBook-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in ''Fahrenheit 451''.<ref name=LAweekly/> Nevertheless, the role of censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Touponce|first2=William F.|title=Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction|date=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387798|url=https://archive.org/details/raybradburylifeo00elle|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/raybradburylifeo00elle/page/91 91]|quote=The main target of ''Fahrenheit 451'' is not censorship, as is often supposed, but rather mass culture...}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Literature suppressed on social grounds|last=Sova|first=Dawn B.|publisher=Facts On File|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=133\u2013135|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out that the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment for the general public.<ref name=\"reid_p59-60\">{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1994 interview, Bradbury stated that ''Fahrenheit 451'' was more relevant during this time than in any other, stating that, \"it works even better because we have [[political correctness]] now.

After the EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag goes outside and overhears Clarisse and her family talking about the way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society. Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of his wife's near-death. Over the next few days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag each night as he walks home. She tells him about how her simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers and how she is forced to go to therapy for her behavior and thoughts. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes missing. He senses something is wrong.<ref name=koster_p35>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/35 35]|quote=Montag does not realize at first that she is gone, or that he misses her; he simply feels that something is the matter.}}</ref>\n\nIn the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and [[self-immolation|burn herself alive]]. Jarred by the woman's suicide, Montag returns home and hides the stolen book under his pillow. Later, Montag wakes Mildred from her sleep and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. She reveals that Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of \"The Mechanical Hound\", an eight-legged<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/32 32]|quote=The Mechanical Hound is an eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.}}</ref> robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen in hunting book hoarders.\n\nMontag awakens ill the next morning. Mildred tries to care for her husband but finds herself more involved in the \"parlor wall\" entertainment in the living room \u2013 large televisions filling the walls. Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night, and Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall \"family\". Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing his concerns, Beatty recounts the history of how books lost their value and how the firemen were adapted for their current role: over the course of several decades, people began to embrace new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and an ever-quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate short [[attention span]]s while minority groups protested the controversial, outdated content they perceived in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines remained, as these fed into the mainstream population's desire for mindless entertainment). At the same time, advances in technology resulted in nearly all buildings being made out of fireproof materials, and the traditional role of firemen in preventing fires was no longer necessary. The government instead turned the firemen into officers of society's peace of mind: instead of putting out fires they became responsible for starting them, specifically for the purpose of burning books, which were condemned as sources of confusing and depressing thoughts that only complicated people's lives. After an awkward encounter between Mildred and Montag over the book hidden under Montag's pillow, Beatty becomes suspicious and casually adds a passing threat as he leaves, telling Montag that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the next 24 hours. If he refused, the other firemen would come and burn his house down for him. The encounter leaves Montag shaken.\n\nAfter Beatty leaves, Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in the air-conditioning duct in their ceiling. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in the kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal.\n\n===\"The Sieve and the Sand\"===\n\nMontag and Mildred discuss the stolen books, and Mildred refuses to go along with it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He suggests that perhaps the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the \"parlor walls\" that night at Mildred's house.\n\nMontag concedes that Mildred is a lost cause and he will need help to understand the books. He remembers an old man named Faber, an English professor before books were banned, whom he once met in a park. Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the [[Bible]], the book he stole at the woman's house. Once there, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.\n\nAt home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the \"parlor walls\". Not interested in this insipid entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they truly are. Enraged by their idiocy, Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition firemen act out once a year: they find an old book and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite the poem ''[[Dover Beach]]'', causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. At the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book. Mildred's friends leave in disgust, while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom and attempts to kill herself again by overdosing on sleeping pills.\n\nMontag hides his books in the backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible. He finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen. Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. Thus Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds, and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive recklessly in the fire truck to the destination: Montag's house.\n\n===\"Burning Bright\"===\n\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends reported him after what happened the other night. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a [[flamethrower]], but Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and, after Beatty taunts him, Montag burns his boss alive and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. Before he escapes, however, he realizes that Beatty had wanted to die a long time ago and had purposely goaded Montag as well as provided him with a weapon.\n\nMontag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled [[Bibliophiles|book-lovers]] who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another Mechanical Hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. On the road, a speeding car attempts to run him over, but he manages to evade the vehicle, and realizes he almost suffered the same fate as Clarisse. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream. Montag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, led by a man named Granger. Granger shows Montag the ongoing manhunt on a portable battery TV and predicts that \u201cMontag\u201d will be caught within the next few minutes; as predicted, an innocent man is then caught and killed.\n\nThe drifters are all former intellectuals. They have each memorized books should the day arrive that society comes to an end and is forced to rebuild itself anew, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. Granger asks Montag what he has to contribute to the group and Montag finds that he had partially memorized the [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]]. While learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons: the imminent war has begun and ended in the same night. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (including Mildred) is immediately killed. Montag and the group are injured and dirtied, but manage to survive the shockwave.\n\nThe following morning, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes, but explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built so that people can take a long look at themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.\n\n==Characters==\n\n*'''[[Guy Montag]]''' is the [[protagonist]] and a fireman who presents the dystopian world in which he lives first through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, then as a man in conflict about it, and eventually as someone resolved to be free of it. Through most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes only what he hears.\n*'''Clarisse McClellan''' is a young girl one month short of her 17th birthday who is Montag's neighbor.<ref group=note>Clarisse tells Montag she is \"seventeen and crazy\", later admitting that she will actually be seventeen \"next month\".</ref><ref name=koster_p31>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko|url-access=registration|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsonfahren00deko/page/31 31]|quote=Montag's new neighbor, the sixteen-year-old Clarisse, appears in only a few scenes at the beginning of the novel.}}</ref> She walks with Montag on his trips home from work.

She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking \"why\" instead of \"how\" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after her first meeting with Montag, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family moved away following her death. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old schoolteacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.\n*'''Mildred \"Millie\" Montag''' is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her \"parlor walls\" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described in the book as \"thin as a [[praying mantis]] from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon.\" Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by reading ''Dover Beach'', and finding herself unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him, and dies when the city is bombed.\n*'''Captain Beatty''' is Montag's boss and the book's main antagonist. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content and contradicting facts and opinions. After attempting to force Montag to burn his house, Montag kills him with a flamethrower, only to later realize that Beatty had given him the flamethrower and goaded him on purpose so that Montag would kill him. However, it is still unclear whether or not Beatty was ever on Montag's side, or if he was just suicidal. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for the ''Fahrenheit 451'' play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.\n*'''Stoneman '''and '''Black''' are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function only to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they are told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently realizes how damaging it is to society. Black is later framed by Montag for possessing books.\n*'''Faber''' is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. He secretly communicates with Montag through an electronic ear-piece and helps Montag escape the city, then gets on a bus to [[St. Louis]] and escapes the city himself before it is bombed. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, [[Faber-Castell]].\n*'''Mrs. Ann Bowles '''and '''Mrs. Clara Phelps''' are Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic mainstream society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice-married single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads ''Dover Beach'' to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading \"silly awful hurting words\".\n*'''Granger''' is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.\n\n==Title==\n\nThe title page of the book explains the title as follows: ''Fahrenheit 451\u2014The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns...''.

Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]], he was concerned about [[censorship in the United States]]. During a radio interview in 1956,<ref>{{cite web |others=Narrated by Norman Rose |title=Ticket to the Moon (tribute to SciFi) |date=December 4, 1956 |website=Biography in Sound |publisher=NBC Radio News |url=https://oldradioprograms.us/My%20Old%20Radio%20Shows/B/Biographies%20In%20Sound/Biographies%20In%20Sound%20(NBC)-1956-12-04-Ticket%20To%20The%20Moon%20-%20Tribute%20To%20Scifi.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |at=27:10\u201327:57}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Definitive Biography in Sound Radio Log|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Biography-In-Sound.html|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Bradbury said:<blockquote>I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.</blockquote>\n\nAs time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of ''Fahrenheit 451'' were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:<blockquote>In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was ''not'' fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960). Bradbury directly foretells this incident early in the work: \"And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talking coming in.\" p.12</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis story echoes Mildred's \"Seashell ear-thimbles\" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that ''Fahrenheit 451'' is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature.<ref name=LAweekly>{{cite web|title=Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted|last=Johnston|first=Amy E.

And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, [[Mattachine]]/[[Four Square Gospel]] feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse.&nbsp;[...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever.&nbsp;[...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at [[Ballantine Books]], fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. [[Judy-Lynn del Rey]], one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury|date=2003|title=Fahrenheit 451|edition=50th anniversary|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-34296-8|pages=175\u201379}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBook-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in ''Fahrenheit 451''.<ref name=LAweekly/> Nevertheless, the role of censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Touponce|first2=William F.|title=Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction|date=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387798|url=https://archive.org/details/raybradburylifeo00elle|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/raybradburylifeo00elle/page/91 91]|quote=The main target of ''Fahrenheit 451'' is not censorship, as is often supposed, but rather mass culture...}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Literature suppressed on social grounds|last=Sova|first=Dawn B.|publisher=Facts On File|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=133\u2013135|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out that the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment for the general public.<ref name=\"reid_p59-60\">{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robin Anne|title=Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion|series=Critical Companions to Popular Contemporary Writers|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-313-30901-9|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1994 interview, Bradbury stated that Fahrenheit 451 was more relevant during this time than in any other, stating that, \"it works even better because we have [[political correctness]] now.
