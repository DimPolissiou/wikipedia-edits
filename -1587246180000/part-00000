The runtime library is '''libintl'''. gettext provides an option to use different strings for any number of [[plural form]]s of nouns, but it has no support for [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==History==\nInitially, POSIX provided no means of localizing messages. Two proposals were raised in the late 1980s, the 1988 Uniforum gettext and the 1989 X/Open catgets (XPG-3 &sect; 5). [[Sun Microsystems]] implemented the first gettext in 1993. The Unix and POSIX developers never really agreed on what kind of interface to use (the other option is the X/Open catgets), so many [[C library|C libraries]], including [[glibc]], implemented both.<ref>{{cite web |title=Message Translation |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Message-Translation.html |website=The GNU C Library}}</ref> {{As of|2019|08}}, whether gettext should be part of POSIX was still a point of debate in the [[Austin Group]], despite the fact that its old foe has already fallen out of use. Concerns cited included its dependence on the system-set locale (a [[global variable]] subject to multithreading problems) and its support for newer C-language extensions involving wide strings.<ref>{{cite web |title=0001122: POSIX should include gettext() and friends - Austin Group Defect Tracker |url=http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1122 |website=Austin Group Defect Tracker}}</ref>\n\nThe [[GNU Project]] decided that the message-as-key approach of gettext is simpler and more friendly. (Most other systems, including catgets, requires the developer to come up with \"key\" names for every string.)<ref>{{cite web |title=The Programmer's View |url=http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gettext-0.10.35/html_chapter/gettext_8.html |website=gettext 0.10.35| date=30 April 1998}}</ref> They released GNU gettext, a [[free software]] implementation of the system in 1995.<ref name=history /> Gettext, GNU or not, has since been ported to many programming languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: List of Programming Languages |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/List-of-Programming-Languages.html#List-of-Programming-Languages}}</ref> The simplicity of po and widespread editor support even lead to its adoption in non-program contexts for text documents or as an intermediate between other localization formats, with converters like po4a (po for anything) and Translate Toolkit emerging to provide such a bridge.<ref>{{cite web |title=po4a |url=https://po4a.org/index.php.en |website=po4a.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The essential toolkit for localization engineers |url=https://toolkit.translatehouse.org/ |website=Translate Toolkit}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n\n===Programming===\n[[File:Gettext.svg|thumb|Typical gettext workflow.  The de.po instance on the left shows a \"renewing\" of translations via msgmerge.]]\nThe basic interface of gettext is the {{code|gettext(const char*)}} function, which accepts a [[string (computer science)|string]] that the user will see in the original language, usually English. To save typing time, and to reduce code clutter, this function is commonly [[aliasing (computing)|aliased]] to <code>_</code>:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\nprintf(gettext(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name);\nprintf(_(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name); // same, but shorter\n</source>\n\n<code>gettext()</code> then uses the supplied strings as keys for looking up translations, and will return the original string when no translation is available. This is in contrast to [[POSIX]] <code>catgets()</code>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/catgets.html |website=gnu.org |title=About catgets |accessdate=2017-10-24}}</ref> [[AmigaOS]] <code>GetString()</code>, or [[Microsoft Windows]] <code>LoadString()</code>  where a programmatic ID (often an integer) is used. To handle the case where the same original-language text can have different meanings, gettext has functions like <code>cgettext()</code> that accept an additional \"context\" string.\n\n<code>xgettext</code> is run on the sources to produce a <code>.pot</code> (Portable Object Template) file, which contains a list of all the translatable strings extracted from the sources. Comments starting with <code>///</code> are used to give translators hints, although other prefixes are also configurable to further limit the scope. One such common prefix is <code>TRANSLATORS:</code>.\n\nFor example, an input file with a comment might look like:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n/// TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences\nprintf(_(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name);\n</source>\n\n<code>xgettext</code> is run using the command:\n\n xgettext -c /\n\nThe resultant .pot file looks like this with the comment (note that xgettext recognizes the string as a [[C (programming language)|C]]-language [[printf]] format string):\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\n#. TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences\n#, c-format\n#: src/name.c:36\nmsgid \"My name is %s.\\n\"\nmsgstr \"\"\n</source>\n\nIn POSIX [[shell script]], gettext provides a <code>gettext.sh</code> library one can include that provides the many same functions gettext provides in similar languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: sh |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/sh.html}}</ref> [[GNU bash]] also has a simplified construct <code>$\"msgid\"</code> for the simple gettext function, although it depends on the C library to provide a <code>gettext()</code> function.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: bash |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/bash.html}}</ref>\n\n===Translating===\nThe translator derives a <code>.po</code> (Portable Object) file from the template using the <code>msginit</code> program, then fills out the translations.<ref name=msginit>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html |title=GNU gettext utilities: PO Files |website=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> <code>msginit</code> initializes the translations so, for instance, for a French language translation, the command to run would be:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/tutorials/how-to-translate-with-gettext-po-and-pot-files/ |title=How to Translate With GetText PO and POT Files |website=Icanlocalize.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n msginit --locale=fr --input=name.pot\n\nThis will create <code>fr.po</code>. The translator then edits the resultant file, either by hand or with a translation tool like [[Poedit]], or [[Emacs]] with its editing mode for <code>.po</code> files. An edited entry will look like:\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\n#: src/name.c:36\nmsgid \"My name is %s.\\n\"\nmsgstr \"Je m'appelle %s.\\n\"\n</source>\n\nFinally, the .po files are compiled with <code>msgfmt</code> into binary <code>.mo</code> (Machine Object) files.  GNU gettext may use its own file name extension <code>.gmo</code> on systems with another gettext implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Files.html | title=Files Conveying Translations|website=Gnu.org | accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> These are now ready for distribution with the software package.\n\nGNU <code>msgfmt</code> can also perform some checks relevant to the [[format string]] used by the programming language.

As with the convention of <code>gettext()</code>, it is often aliased to <code>N_</code> in practical use. Consider the code sample:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n// parameters: english singular, english plural, integer count\nprintf(ngettext(\"I have written an article.\\n\", \"I have written %d articles.\\n\", n), n);\n</source>\n\nA header in the <code>\"\"</code> (empty string) entry of the PO file stores some metadata, one of which is the plural form that the language uses, usually specified using a C-style [[ternary expression]]. Let's say we want to translate for the [[Irish language]]:\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\nmsgid \"\"\nmsgstr \"\"\n\"...\"\n\"Language: ga\\n\"\n\"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=n==1 ? 0 : n==2 ? 1 : 2;\\n\"\n</source>\n\nSince now there are three plural forms, the final po would look like:\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\n#: src/wiki.c:29\nmsgid \"I have written an article.\\n\"\nmsgid_plural \"I have written %d articles.\\n\"\nmsgstr[0] \"Irish speaker needed\"\nmsgstr[1] \"\"\nmsgstr[2] \"\"\n</source>\n\nReference plural rules for languages are provided by the [[Unicode consortium]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Language Plural Rules |url=https://unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html |website=unicode.org}}</ref> msginit also prefills the appropriate rule when creating a file for one specific language.<ref name=msginit/>\n\n==Implementations==\nIn addition to [[C (programming language)|C]], gettext has the following implementations: [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] for both [[ASP.NET]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/gettext-cs-utils/ |title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting |website=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/turquoiseowl/i18n |title=turquoiseowl/i18n: Smart internationalization for ASP.NET |website=GitHub.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> and for [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/robert-j-engdahl/ngettext-wpf |title=NGettext.Wpf - Proper internationalization support for WPF (via NGettext)}}</ref> [[Perl]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/gflohr/libintl-perl |title=libintl-perl - An Internationalization Library for Perl That Aims To Be Compatible With the Uniforum Message Translations System as Implemented For Example in GNU Gettext |website=github.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-14}}</ref> [[PHP]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.gettext.php |title=Gettext |website=php.net |accessdate=2017-10-24}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/gettext.html|title=gettext \u2014 Multilingual internationalization services \u2014 Python 3.7.0 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=2018-09-21}}</ref> [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/makkarpov/scalingua|title=makkarpov/scalingua: A simple gettext-like internationalization library for Scala|website=github.com|accessdate=2016-04-28}}</ref> and [[Node.js]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/DanielBaulig/node-gettext |title=DanielBaulig/node-gettext: An adaption of Joshua I.

The runtime library is '''libintl'''. gettext provides an option to use different strings for any number of [[plural form]]s of nouns, but it has no support for [[grammatical gender]].\n\n==History==\nInitially, POSIX provided no means of localizing messages. Two proposals were raised in the late 1980s, the 1988 Uniforum gettext and the 1989 X/Open catgets (XPG-3 &sect; 5). [[Sun Microsystems]] implemented the first gettext in 1993. The Unix and POSIX developers never really agreed on what kind of interface to use (the other option is the X/Open catgets), so many [[C library|C libraries]], including [[glibc]], implemented both.<ref>{{cite web |title=Message Translation |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Message-Translation.html |website=The GNU C Library}}</ref> {{As of|2019|08}}, whether gettext should be part of POSIX was still a point of debate in the [[Austin Group]], despite the fact that its old foe has already fallen out of use. Concerns cited included its dependence on the system-set locale (a [[global variable]] subject to multithreading problems) and its support for newer C-language extensions involving wide strings.<ref>{{cite web |title=0001122: POSIX should include gettext() and friends - Austin Group Defect Tracker |url=http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1122 |website=Austin Group Defect Tracker}}</ref>\n\nThe [[GNU Project]] decided that the message-as-key approach of gettext is simpler and more friendly. (Most other systems, including catgets, requires the developer to come up with \"key\" names for every string.)<ref>{{cite web |title=The Programmer's View |url=http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gettext-0.10.35/html_chapter/gettext_8.html |website=gettext 0.10.35| date=30 April 1998}}</ref> They released GNU gettext, a [[free software]] implementation of the system in 1995.<ref name=history /> Gettext, GNU or not, has since been ported to many programming languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: List of Programming Languages |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/List-of-Programming-Languages.html#List-of-Programming-Languages}}</ref> The simplicity of po and widespread editor support even lead to its adoption in non-program contexts for text documents or as an intermediate between other localization formats, with converters like po4a (po for anything) and Translate Toolkit emerging to provide such a bridge.<ref>{{cite web |title=po4a |url=https://po4a.org/index.php.en |website=po4a.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The essential toolkit for localization engineers |url=https://toolkit.translatehouse.org/ |website=Translate Toolkit}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n\n===Programming===\n[[File:Gettext.svg|thumb|Typical gettext workflow.  The de.po instance on the left shows a \"renewing\" of translations via msgmerge.]]\nThe basic interface of gettext is the {{code|gettext(const char*)}} function, which accepts a [[string (computer science)|string]] that the user will see in the original language, usually English. To save typing time, and to reduce code clutter, this function is commonly [[aliasing (computing)|aliased]] to <code>_</code>:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\nprintf(gettext(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name);\nprintf(_(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name); // same, but shorter\n</source>\n\n<code>gettext()</code> then uses the supplied strings as keys for looking up translations, and will return the original string when no translation is available. This is in contrast to [[POSIX]] <code>catgets()</code>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/catgets.html |website=gnu.org |title=About catgets |accessdate=2017-10-24}}</ref> [[AmigaOS]] <code>GetString()</code>, or [[Microsoft Windows]] <code>LoadString()</code>  where a programmatic ID (often an integer) is used. To handle the case where the same original-language text can have different meanings, gettext has functions like <code>cgettext()</code> that accept an additional \"context\" string.\n\n<code>xgettext</code> is run on the sources to produce a <code>.pot</code> (Portable Object Template) file, which contains a list of all the translatable strings extracted from the sources. Comments starting with <code>///</code> are used to give translators hints, although other prefixes are also configurable to further limit the scope. One such common prefix is <code>TRANSLATORS:</code>.\n\nFor example, an input file with a comment might look like:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n/// TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences\nprintf(_(\"My name is %s.\\n\"), my_name);\n</source>\n\n<code>xgettext</code> is run using the command:\n\n xgettext -c /\n\nThe resultant .pot file looks like this with the comment (note that xgettext recognizes the string as a [[C (programming language)|C]]-language [[printf]] format string):\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\n#. TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user's name as specified in Preferences\n#, c-format\n#: src/name.c:36\nmsgid \"My name is %s.\\n\"\nmsgstr \"\"\n</source>\n\nIn POSIX [[shell script]], gettext provides a <code>gettext.sh</code> library one can include that provides the many same functions gettext provides in similar languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: sh |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/sh.html}}</ref> [[GNU bash]] also has a simplified construct <code>$\"msgid\"</code> for the simple gettext function, although it depends on the C library to provide a <code>gettext()</code> function.<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU gettext utilities: bash |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/bash.html}}</ref>\n\n===Translating===\nThe translator derives a <code>.po</code> (Portable Object) file from the template using the <code>msginit</code> program, then fills out the translations.<ref name=msginit>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html |title=GNU gettext utilities: PO Files |website=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> <code>msginit</code> initializes the translations so, for instance, for a French language translation, the command to run would be:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icanlocalize.com/site/tutorials/how-to-translate-with-gettext-po-and-pot-files/ |title=How to Translate With GetText PO and POT Files |website=Icanlocalize.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n msginit --locale=fr --input=name.pot\n\nThis will create <code>fr.po</code>. The translator then edits the resultant file, either by hand or with a translation tool like [[Poedit]], or [[Emacs]] with its editing mode for <code>.po</code> files. An edited entry will look like:\n<source lang=\"gettext\">\n#: src/name.c:36\nmsgid \"My name is %s.\\n\"\nmsgstr \"Je m'appelle %s.\\n\"\n</source>\n\nFinally, the .po files are compiled with <code>msgfmt</code> into binary <code>.mo</code> (Machine Object) files.  GNU gettext may use its own file name extension <code>.gmo</code> on systems with another gettext implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Files.html | title=Files Conveying Translations|website=Gnu.org | accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref> These are now ready for distribution with the software package.\n\nGNU <code>msgfmt</code> can also perform some checks relevant to the [[format string]] used by the programming language. It also allows for outputting to language-specific formats other than MO.<ref>{{cite web |title=msgfmt Invocation |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/msgfmt-Invocation.html |website=GNU gettext utilities}}</ref> \n\nIn later phases of the developmental workflow, <code>msgmerge</code> can be used to \"update\" an old translation to a newer template. There is also <code>msgunfmt</code> for reverse-compiling <code>.mo</code> files, and many other utilities for batch processing.\n\n===Running===\nThe user, on [[Unix]]-type systems, sets the [[environment variable]] <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, and the program will display strings in the selected language, if there is an <code>.mo</code> file for it.\n\nUsers on [[GNU variants]] can also use the environment variable <code>LANGUAGE</code> instead. Its main difference from the Unix variable is that it supports multiple languages, separated with a colon, for fallback.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html#Locale-Environment-Variables |title=GNU gettext utilities: Locale Environment Variables |website=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Plural form ==\nThe <code>ngettext()</code> interface accounts for the count of a noun in the string. As with the convention of <code>gettext()</code>, it is often aliased to <code>N_</code> in practical use. Consider the code sample:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\n// parameters: english singular, english plural, integer count\nprintf(ngettext(\"I have written an article.\\n\", \"I have written %d articles.\\n\", n), n);\n</source>\n\nA header in the <code>\"\"</code> (empty string) entry of the PO file stores some metadata, one of which is the plural form that the language uses, usually specified using a C-style [[ternary expression]].

The online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the [[core banking]] system operated by a bank and is in contrast to [[branch banking]] which was the traditional way customers accessed banking services.\n\nSome banks operate as a \"[[direct bank]]\" (or \u201cvirtual bank\u201d), where they rely completely on internet banking.\n\nInternet banking software provides personal and corporate banking services offering features such as viewing account balances, obtaining statements, checking recent transactions, transferring money between accounts, and making payments.\n\n==History==\n{{Contradict|section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Precursors===\nThe precursor to the modern home banking services were the distance banking services over electronic media from the early 1980s. The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred to the use of a terminal, keyboard, and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank.\n\n=== Emergence of computer banking ===\nThe first known deployment of home computer banking to consumers came in December 1980 at United American Bank, a [[community bank]] headquartered in Knoxville, Tenn. United American partnered with [[Radio Shack]] to produce a secure custom modem for its [[TRS-80]] computer that would allow bank customers to access account information securely. Services available in its first year included bill pay, account balance checks, and loan applications, as well as game access, budget and tax calculators and daily newspapers. Thousands of customers paid $25-30 per month for the service.<ref name=\"Sudman\">{{cite news |last1=Sparks |first1=Evan |title=Nine Young Bankers Who Changed America: Thomas Sudman |url=https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2017/06/nine-young-bankers-who-changed-america-thomas-sudman/ |accessdate=12 March 2019 |work=ABA Banking Journal |date=26 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nLarge banks, many working on parallel tracks to United American, followed in 1981 when four of New York's major banks ([[Citibank]], [[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]], [[Chemical Bank|Chemical]], and [[Manufacturers Hanover]]) offered home banking services,<ref>Cronin, Mary J.

Because of the commercial failure of videotex, these banking services never became popular except in France (where the use of videotex ([[Minitel]]) was subsidized by the telecom provider) and the UK, where the [[Prestel]] system was used.\n\nThe developers of United American Bank's first-to-market computer banking system aimed to license it nationally, but they were overtaken by competitors when United American failed in 1983 as a result of loan fraud on the part of bank owner [[Jake Butcher]], the 1978 Tennessee Democratic nominee for governor and promoter of the [[1982 Knoxville World's Fair]]. [[First Tennessee Bank]], which purchased the failed bank, did not attempt to develop or commercialize the computer banking platform.<ref name=\"Sudman\" />\n\n===Internet and customer reluctance===\nWhen the clicks-and-bricks euphoria hit in the late 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Information-Technology-And-The-Banking-Industry-PKGEFFWKFT85|title=Information Technology And The Banking Industry|last=|first=|date=2014-09-24|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref> In 1996 [[OP Financial Group]], also a [[cooperative bank]], became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.op.fi/op-financial-group/about-us/op-financial-group-in-brief/history | title=History - About us - OP Group}}</ref> The attraction of banks to online banking are fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions to [[Product bundling|bundle]] more services into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead.\n\nA mergers-and-acquisitions wave swept the financial industries in the mid- and late 1990s, greatly expanding bank's customer bases. Following this, banks looked to the Web as a way of maintaining their customers and building loyalty. A number of different factors are causing bankers to shift more of their business to the virtual realm.\n\nWhile financial institutions took steps to implement e-banking services in the mid-1990s, many consumers were hesitant to conduct monetary transactions over the internet. It took widespread adoption of electronic commerce, based on trailblazing companies such as America Online, Amazon.com and eBay, to make the idea of paying for items online widespread.\n\nBy 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended.\nIn 2001, Bank of America became the first bank to top 3 million online banking customers, more than 20% of its customer base.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/68577/optimal-digital-banking-vendor-selection/|title=Is Your Digital Banking Vendor Hurting Adoption Rates?|last=Veeraghanta|first=Murthy|last2=Corporation|first2=CEO of VSoft|date=2017-11-08|website=The Financial Brand|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> In comparison, larger national institutions, such as Citigroup claimed 2.2 million online relationships globally, while J.P.

Online customers proved more loyal and profitable than regular customers. In October 2001, Bank of America customers executed a record 3.1 million electronic bill payments, totaling more than $1 billion.

These internet-based banks incur lower overhead costs than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. In the United States, deposits at most direct banks are FDIC-insured and offer the same level of insurance protection as traditional banks.\n\n===First online banking services by region===\n====The United Kingdom====\nOnline banking started in the United Kingdom with the launch of [[Nottingham Building Society|Nottingham Building Society (NBS)]]'s [[Homelink (Britain)|Homelink]] service in September 1982, initially on a restricted basis, before it was expanded nationally in 1983.<ref name=Prendergast>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Prendergast |first=Gerald Paul Joseph |date=1992 |title=Human interaction in service delivery and its relationship to disenchantment discontinuance in the diffusion of self-service technologies: a case study in retail banking |publisher=Massey University |page=121 |url=https://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/3524/02_whole.pdf}}</ref> Homelink was delivered through a partnership with the [[Bank of Scotland]] and British Telecom's [[Prestel]] service.<ref name=NYTimes1984>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/02/business/british-move-fast-in-home-banking.html |title=British Move Fast in Home Banking |date=2 January 1984 |newspaper=New York Times |page=39}}</ref> The system used [[Prestel]] viewlink system and a computer, such as the [[BBC Micro]], or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed users to \"transfer money between accounts, pay bills and arrange loans... compare prices and order goods from a few major retailers, check local restaurant menus or real estate listings, arrange vacations... enter bids in Homelink's regular auctions and send electronic mail to other Homelink users.\"<ref name=NYTimes1984/> In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. [[BACS]] was later used to transfer the payment directly.\n\n====The United States====\nIn the United States in-home banking was \"is still in its infancy\" with banks \"cautiously testing consumer interest\" in 1984, a year after online banking went national in the UK.<ref name=NYTimes1984/> At the time [[Chemical Bank]] in New York was \"still working out the bugs from its service, which offers somewhat limited features\".<ref name=NYTimes1984/> The service from Chemical, called [[Pronto (service)|Pronto]], was launched in 1983 and was aimed at individuals and small businesses. It enabled them to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. The other three major banks \u2014 [[Citibank]], [[Chase Bank]] and [[Manufacturers Hanover]] \u2014 started to offer home banking services soon after. Chemical's Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had a similar experience. \n\nSince it first appeared in the United States, online banking has been federally governed by the ''Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978''.<ref>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/efta.pdf \"Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978\"]</ref>\n\n====France====\n\nAfter a test period with 2,500 users starting in 1984, online banking services were launched in 1988,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://histoire.bnpparibas/dossier/le-minitel-larrivee-de-la-banque-a-domicile/# | title=Le minitel, l'arriv\u00e9e de la banque \u00e0 domicile}}</ref> using [[Minitel]] terminals that were distributed freely to the population by the government.\n\nBy 1990, 6.5 million Minitels were installed in households.

Initially, they used the internet as another brochure, without interaction with the customer. Early sites featured pictures of the bank's officers or buildings, and provided customers with maps of branches and ATM locations, phone numbers to call for further information and simple listings of products.\n\n===Interactive banking on the Web===\nIn 1995, Wells Fargo was the first U.S. bank to add account services to its website, with other banks quickly following suit. That same year, Presidential became the first U.S. bank to open bank accounts over the internet. According to research by Online Banking Report, at the end of 1999 less than 0.4% of households in the U.S. were using online banking. At the beginning of 2004, some 33 million U.S. households (31%) were using some form of online banking. Five years later, 47% of Americans used online banking, according to a survey by Gartner Group. Meanwhile, in the UK online banking grew from 63% to 70% of internet users between 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"huddersfield\">Abdou, Hussein, English, John and Adewunmi, Paul [http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/21250/1/An_investigation_of_risk_management_practices_in_electronic_banking_revised_version_-_Final_accepted_version_-_BBS.pdf ''An investigation of risk management practices in electronic banking: the case of the UK banks''] eprints.hud.ac.uk, University of Huddersfield, July 22, 2014 (PDF; 474 kB)</ref>  By 2018, the number of digital banking users in the U.S. reached approximately 61 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/946109/digital-banking-users-usa/|title=U.S. digital banking usage 2022|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> The penetration of online banking in Europe has been increased as well.

The credentials for online banking is normally not the same as for [[telephone banking|telephone]] or [[mobile banking]]. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers, whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customer numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. Technically, the customer number can be linked to any account with the financial institution that the customer controls, though the financial institution may limit the range of accounts that may be accessed to, say, cheque, savings, loan, credit card and similar accounts.\n\nThe customer visits the financial institution's [[HTTPS|secure website]], and enters the online banking facility using the customer number and credentials previously set up. \n\nEach financial institution can determine the types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of recent transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, financing loans and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or another's [[deposit account|account]]s. Most banks set limits on the amounts that may be transacted, and other restrictions. Most banks also enable customers to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop payment on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.\n\n==Features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nOnline banking facilities typically have many features and capabilities in common, but also have some that are application specific. The common features fall broadly into several categories:\n\n* A bank customer can perform non-transactional tasks through online banking, including:\n** Viewing account balances\n** Viewing recent transactions\n** Downloading [[bank statement]]s, for example in [[PDF]] format\n** Viewing images of paid [[cheque]]s\n** Ordering cheque books\n** Download periodic account statements\n** Downloading applications for M-banking, E-banking etc.\n* Bank customers can transact banking tasks through online banking, including:\n** [[Giro|Funds transfers]] between the customer's linked accounts\n** Paying third parties, including [[Electronic bill payment|bill payments]] (see, e.g., [[BPAY]]) and third party [[Electronic fund transfer|fund transfers]] (see, e.g., [[Fast And Secure Transfers|FAST]])\n** Investment purchase or sale\n** Loan applications and transactions, such as repayments of enrollments\n** Credit card applications\n** Register utility billers and make bill payments\n* Financial institution administration\n* Management of multiple users having varying levels of authority\n* Transaction approval process\n\nSome financial institutions offer special internet banking services, for example:\n* Personal financial management support, such as importing data into personal accounting software. Some online banking platforms support [[account aggregation]] to allow the customers to monitor all of their accounts in one place whether they are with their main bank or with other institutions.\n\n==Security==\n[[File:Diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les de lecteurs de cartes bancaires.jpg|280px|thumb|Five [[security token]] devices for online banking]]\nSecurity of a customer's financial information is very important, without which online banking could not operate. Similarly the reputational risks to  banks themselves are important.<ref name=\"huddersfield\"/> Financial institutions have set up various security processes to reduce the risk of unauthorized online access to a customer's records, but there is no consistency to the various approaches adopted.\n\nThe use of a [[secure website]] has been almost universally embraced.\n\nThough single [[password]] [[authentication]] is still in use, it by itself is not considered secure enough for online banking in some countries. Basically there are two different security methods in use for online banking:\n* The [[Personal Identification Number|PIN]]/[[Transaction authentication number|TAN]] system where the PIN represents a password, used for the login and TANs representing [[one-time password]]s to authenticate transactions. TANs can be distributed in different ways, the most popular one is to send a list of TANs to the online banking user by postal letter. Another way of using TANs is to generate them by need using a [[security token]]. These token generated TANs depend on the time and a unique secret, stored in the security token ([[two-factor authentication]] or 2FA).\n\n:More advanced TAN generators ([[chipTAN]]) also include the transaction data into the TAN generation process after displaying it on their own screen to allow the user to discover [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s carried out by [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] trying to secretly manipulate the transaction data in the background of the PC.<ref>[https://www.sparkasse-koelnbonn.de/privatkunden/banking/chiptan/vorteile/index.php ''chipTAN (Sicherungsverfahren im Online-Banking)''] sparkasse-koelnbonn.de, Sparkasse K\u00f6lnBonn (A\u00f6R), Retrieved on April 10, 2014.</ref>\n\n:Another way to provide TANs to an online banking user is to send the TAN of the current bank transaction to the user's (GSM) mobile phone via SMS. The SMS text usually quotes the transaction amount and details, the TAN is only valid for a short period of time. Especially in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands many banks have adopted this [[MTAN|\"SMS TAN\"]] service.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 July 2014|title=THE PRAGMATIC REVIEW ON INTERNET BANKING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES IN INDIA|url=https://www.ijccr.com/July2014/20.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computing and Corporate Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There is also \"[[PhotoTAN]]\" service, where the bank generates and sends a QR code image to a smartphone device of the online banking user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/TAN-transaction-authentication-number|title=What is TAN (transaction authentication number)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|website=SearchSecurity|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> \n:Usually online banking with PIN/TAN is done via a web browser using SSL secured connections, so that there is no additional encryption needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.solidpass.com/solutions/online-banking-security.html|title=Online Banking Security|website=www.solidpass.com|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\n* Signature based online banking where all transactions are signed and encrypted digitally. The Keys for the signature generation and encryption can be stored on smartcards or any memory medium, depending on the concrete implementation (see, e.g., the Spanish [[Identification card|ID card]] ''DNI electr\u00f3nico''<ref>[http://www.dnielectronico.es/ DNI electr\u00f3nico de Espa\u00f1a/Spanish ID-card]</ref>).\n\n===Attacks===\nAttacks on online banking used today are based on deceiving the user to steal login data and valid TANs. Two well known examples for those attacks are [[phishing]] and [[pharming]]. [[Cross-site scripting]] and [[keylogger]]/[[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] can also be used to steal login information.\n\nA method to attack signature based online banking methods is to manipulate the used software in a way, that correct transactions are shown on the screen and faked transactions are signed in the background.\n\nA 2008 U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] Technology Incident Report, compiled from suspicious activity reports banks file quarterly, lists 536 cases of computer intrusion, with an average loss per incident of $30,000. That adds up to a nearly $16-million loss in the second quarter of 2007. Computer intrusions increased by 150 percent between the first quarter of 2007 and the second. In 80 percent of the cases, the source of the intrusion is unknown but it occurred during online banking, the report states.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542848/ Security Flaws in Online

[[man-in-the-browser]] attack, a variation of the man-in-the-middle attack where a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] permits a remote attacker to secretly modify the destination account number and also the amount in the web browser.\n\nAs a reaction to advanced security processes allowing the user to cross-check the transaction data on a secure device there are also combined attacks using [[malware]] and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to persuade the user himself to transfer money to the fraudsters on the ground of false claims (like the claim the bank would require a \"test transfer\" or the claim a company had falsely transferred money to the user's account and he should \"send it back\").<ref>[http://www.trusteer.com/blog/tatanga-attack-exposes-chiptan-weaknesses ''Tatanga Attack Exposes chipTAN Weaknesses''] trusteer.com, September 4,

is used<ref>[https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/online-banking-with-the-most-secure-endpoint-device/ Online banking with the most secure endpoint]</ref>, it is advised that the operating system

consider the PC systems of their users being infected by [[malware]] by default and therefore use security processes where the user can cross-check the transaction data against manipulations like for example (provided the security of the mobile phone holds up) [[MTAN|SMS TAN]] where the transaction data is sent along with the TAN number or standalone smartcard readers with an own screen including the transaction data into the TAN generation process while displaying it beforehand to the user (see [[chipTAN]]) to counter [[man-in-the-middle

The term 'online' became popular in the late 1980s and referred to the use of a terminal, keyboard, and TV (or monitor) to access the banking system using a phone line. 'Home banking' can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank.\n\n=== Emergence of computer banking ===\nThe first known deployment of home computer banking to consumers came in December 1980 at United American Bank, a [[community bank]] headquartered in Knoxville, Tenn. United American partnered with [[Radio Shack]] to produce a secure custom modem for its [[TRS-80]] computer that would allow bank customers to access account information securely. Services available in its first year included bill pay, account balance checks, and loan applications, as well as game access, budget and tax calculators and daily newspapers.

[[First Tennessee Bank]], which purchased the failed bank, did not attempt to develop or commercialize the computer banking platform.<ref name=\"Sudman\" />\n\n===Internet and customer reluctance===\nWhen the clicks-and-bricks euphoria hit in the late 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Information-Technology-And-The-Banking-Industry-PKGEFFWKFT85|title=Information Technology And The Banking Industry|last=|first=|date=2014-09-24|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref> In 1996 [[OP Financial Group]], also a [[cooperative bank]], became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.op.fi/op-financial-group/about-us/op-financial-group-in-brief/history | title=History - About us - OP Group}}</ref> The attraction of banks to online banking are fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions to [[Product bundling|bundle]] more services into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead.\n\nA mergers-and-acquisitions wave swept the financial industries in the mid- and late 1990s, greatly expanding bank's customer bases. Following this, banks looked to the Web as a way of maintaining their customers and building loyalty. A number of different factors are causing bankers to shift more of their business to the virtual realm.\n\nWhile financial institutions took steps to implement e-banking services in the mid-1990s, many consumers were hesitant to conduct monetary transactions over the internet. It took widespread adoption of electronic commerce, based on trailblazing companies such as America Online, Amazon.com and eBay, to make the idea of paying for items online widespread.\n\nBy 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended.\nIn 2001, Bank of America became the first bank to top 3 million online banking customers, more than 20% of its customer base.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/68577/optimal-digital-banking-vendor-selection/|title=Is Your Digital Banking Vendor Hurting Adoption Rates?|last=Veeraghanta|first=Murthy|last2=Corporation|first2=CEO of VSoft|date=2017-11-08|website=The Financial Brand|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> In comparison, larger national institutions, such as Citigroup claimed 2.2 million online relationships globally, while J.P. Morgan Chase estimated it had more than 750,000 online banking customers. Wells Fargo had 2.5 million online banking customers, including small businesses. Online customers proved more loyal and profitable than regular customers. In October 2001, Bank of America customers executed a record 3.1 million electronic bill payments, totaling more than $1 billion. As of 2017, the bank has 34 million active digital accounts, both online and mobile.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2009, a report by Gartner Group estimated that 47% of United States adults and 30% in the United Kingdom bank online.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maximizing Business Performance and Efficiency Through Intelligent Systems|last=Rishi|first=Om Prakash|publisher=IGI Global|year=2017|isbn=9781522522348|location=|pages=169}}</ref>\n\nThe early 2000s saw the rise of the branch-less banks as internet only institutions. These internet-based banks incur lower overhead costs than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. In the United States, deposits at most direct banks are FDIC-insured and offer the same level of insurance protection as traditional banks.\n\n===First online banking services by region===\n====The United Kingdom====\nOnline banking started in the United Kingdom with the launch of [[Nottingham Building Society|Nottingham Building Society (NBS)]]'s [[Homelink (Britain)|Homelink]] service in September 1982, initially on a restricted basis, before it was expanded nationally in 1983.<ref name=Prendergast>{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Prendergast |first=Gerald Paul Joseph |date=1992 |title=Human interaction in service delivery and its relationship to disenchantment discontinuance in the diffusion of self-service technologies: a case study in retail banking |publisher=Massey University |page=121 |url=https://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/3524/02_whole.pdf}}</ref> Homelink was delivered through a partnership with the [[Bank of Scotland]] and British Telecom's [[Prestel]] service.<ref name=NYTimes1984>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/02/business/british-move-fast-in-home-banking.html |title=British Move Fast in Home Banking |date=2 January 1984 |newspaper=New York Times |page=39}}</ref> The system used [[Prestel]] viewlink system and a computer, such as the [[BBC Micro]], or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed users to \"transfer money between accounts, pay bills and arrange loans... compare prices and order goods from a few major retailers, check local restaurant menus or real estate listings, arrange vacations... enter bids in Homelink's regular auctions and send electronic mail to other Homelink users.\"<ref name=NYTimes1984/> In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. [[BACS]] was later used to transfer the payment directly.\n\n====The United States====\nIn the United States in-home banking was \"is still in its infancy\" with banks \"cautiously testing consumer interest\" in 1984, a year after online banking went national in the UK.<ref name=NYTimes1984/> At the time [[Chemical Bank]] in New York was \"still working out the bugs from its service, which offers somewhat limited features\".<ref name=NYTimes1984/> The service from Chemical, called [[Pronto (service)|Pronto]], was launched in 1983 and was aimed at individuals and small businesses. It enabled them to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. The other three major banks \u2014 [[Citibank]], [[Chase Bank]] and [[Manufacturers Hanover]] \u2014 started to offer home banking services soon after. Chemical's Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had a similar experience. \n\nSince it first appeared in the United States, online banking has been federally governed by the ''Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978''.<ref>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/efta.pdf \"Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978\"]</ref>\n\n====France====\n\nAfter a test period with 2,500 users starting in 1984, online banking services were launched in 1988,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://histoire.bnpparibas/dossier/le-minitel-larrivee-de-la-banque-a-domicile/# | title=Le minitel, l'arriv\u00e9e de la banque \u00e0 domicile}}</ref> using [[Minitel]] terminals that were distributed freely to the population by the government.\n\nBy 1990, 6.5 million Minitels were installed in households. Online banking was one of the most popular services.\n\nOnline banking services later migrated to Internet.\n\n==== Japan ====\nIn January 1997, the first online banking service was launched by [[The Sumitomo Bank|Sumitomo Bank]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kokusen.go.jp/pdf/n-20001005_3.pdf|title=New banking services for personal customers (\u9280\u884c\u7b49\u306e\u500b\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u65b0\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9)|date=2000-10-05|publisher=National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> By 2010, most major banks implemented online banking services, however, the types of services offered varied.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to a poll conducted by Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) in 2012, 65.2% were the users of personal internet banking<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==== China ====\nIn January 2015, WeBank, the online bank created by [[Tencent]], started 4-month-long online banking trail operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/chinas-first-online-bank-finally-launches/|title=China's First Online Bank Finally Launches|last=PYMNTS|date=2015-01-20|website=PYMNTS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\n==== Australia ====\nIn December 1995, [[Advance Bank]] acquired by [[St.George Bank]], started to provide customers with online banking with the rollout of the C++ Internet banking program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/591137/westpac-group-celebrates-20-years-internet-banking/|title=Westpac Group celebrates 20 years of Internet banking|website=ARN|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\nIn 1998, ICICI Bank introduced internet banking to its customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icicibank.com/aboutus/article.page?identifier=news-icici-bank-completes-20-years-of-digital-banking-journey-the-bank-launches-revamped-imobile-with-many-industryfirst-features-20180612123039494|title=ICICI bank completes 20 years of digital banking|website=ICICI-Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Brazil ====\nIn 1996, Banco Original SA launched its online-only retail banking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazils-first-online-bank-ramps-up-innovation/|title=Brazil's first online bank ramps up innovation|last=Mari|first=Angelica|date=|website=ZDNet|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> In 2019 new banks began to emerge as the [[Conta Simples]], focused only for companies.<ref>{{Citation|last=Werani|first=Thomas|chapter=Business-to-Business-Marketing|pages=3\u201313|publisher=Gabler|isbn=978-3-8349-0346-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-9287-1_1|title=Praxisorientiertes Business-to-Business-Marketing|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n===Banks and the World Wide Web===\nAround 1994, banks saw the rising popularity of the internet as an opportunity to advertise their services. Initially, they used the internet as another brochure, without interaction with the customer. Early sites featured pictures of the bank's officers or buildings, and provided customers with maps of branches and ATM locations, phone numbers to call for further information and simple listings of products.\n\n===Interactive banking on the Web===\nIn 1995, Wells Fargo was the first U.S. bank to add account services to its website, with other banks quickly following suit. That same year, Presidential became the first U.S. bank to open bank accounts over the internet. According to research by Online Banking Report, at the end of 1999 less than 0.4% of households in the U.S. were using online banking. At the beginning of 2004, some 33 million U.S. households (31%) were using some form of online banking. Five years later, 47% of Americans used online banking, according to a survey by Gartner Group. Meanwhile, in the UK online banking grew from 63% to 70% of internet users between 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"huddersfield\">Abdou, Hussein, English, John and Adewunmi, Paul [http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/21250/1/An_investigation_of_risk_management_practices_in_electronic_banking_revised_version_-_Final_accepted_version_-_BBS.pdf ''An investigation of risk management practices in electronic banking: the case of the UK banks''] eprints.hud.ac.uk, University of Huddersfield, July 22, 2014 (PDF; 474 kB)</ref>  By 2018, the number of digital banking users in the U.S. reached approximately 61 percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/946109/digital-banking-users-usa/|title=U.S. digital banking usage 2022|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> The penetration of online banking in Europe has been increased as well.

The credentials for online banking is normally not the same as for [[telephone banking|telephone]] or [[mobile banking]]. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers, whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility. Customer numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because a number of customer accounts can be linked to the one customer number. Technically, the customer number can be linked to any account with the financial institution that the customer controls, though the financial institution may limit the range of accounts that may be accessed to, say, cheque, savings, loan, credit card and similar accounts.\n\nThe customer visits the financial institution's [[HTTPS|secure website]], and enters the online banking facility using the customer number and credentials previously set up. \n\nEach financial institution can determine the types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of recent transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, financing loans and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or another's [[deposit account|account]]s. Most banks set limits on the amounts that may be transacted, and other restrictions. Most banks also enable customers to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop payment on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.\n\n==Features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nOnline banking facilities typically have many features and capabilities in common, but also have some that are application specific. The common features fall broadly into several categories:\n\n* A bank customer can perform non-transactional tasks through online banking, including:\n** Viewing account balances\n** Viewing recent transactions\n** Downloading [[bank statement]]s, for example in [[PDF]] format\n** Viewing images of paid [[cheque]]s\n** Ordering cheque books\n** Download periodic account statements\n** Downloading applications for M-banking, E-banking etc.\n* Bank customers can transact banking tasks through online banking, including:\n** [[Giro|Funds transfers]] between the customer's linked accounts\n** Paying third parties, including [[Electronic bill payment|bill payments]] (see, e.g., [[BPAY]]) and third party [[Electronic fund transfer|fund transfers]] (see, e.g., [[Fast And Secure Transfers|FAST]])\n** Investment purchase or sale\n** Loan applications and transactions, such as repayments of enrollments\n** Credit card applications\n** Register utility billers and make bill payments\n* Financial institution administration\n* Management of multiple users having varying levels of authority\n* Transaction approval process\n\nSome financial institutions offer special internet banking services, for example:\n* Personal financial management support, such as importing data into personal accounting software. Some online banking platforms support [[account aggregation]] to allow the customers to monitor all of their accounts in one place whether they are with their main bank or with other institutions.\n\n==Security==\n[[File:Diff\u00e9rents mod\u00e8les de lecteurs de cartes bancaires.jpg|280px|thumb|Five [[security token]] devices for online banking]]\nSecurity of a customer's financial information is very important, without which online banking could not operate. Similarly the reputational risks to  banks themselves are important.<ref name=\"huddersfield\"/> Financial institutions have set up various security processes to reduce the risk of unauthorized online access to a customer's records, but there is no consistency to the various approaches adopted.\n\nThe use of a [[secure website]] has been almost universally embraced.\n\nThough single [[password]] [[authentication]] is still in use, it by itself is not considered secure enough for online banking in some countries. Basically there are two different security methods in use for online banking:\n* The [[Personal Identification Number|PIN]]/[[Transaction authentication number|TAN]] system where the PIN represents a password, used for the login and TANs representing [[one-time password]]s to authenticate transactions. TANs can be distributed in different ways, the most popular one is to send a list of TANs to the online banking user by postal letter. Another way of using TANs is to generate them by need using a [[security token]]. These token generated TANs depend on the time and a unique secret, stored in the security token ([[two-factor authentication]] or 2FA).\n\n:More advanced TAN generators ([[chipTAN]]) also include the transaction data into the TAN generation process after displaying it on their own screen to allow the user to discover [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s carried out by [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] trying to secretly manipulate the transaction data in the background of the PC.<ref>[https://www.sparkasse-koelnbonn.de/privatkunden/banking/chiptan/vorteile/index.php ''chipTAN (Sicherungsverfahren im Online-Banking)''] sparkasse-koelnbonn.de, Sparkasse K\u00f6lnBonn (A\u00f6R), Retrieved on April 10, 2014.</ref>\n\n:Another way to provide TANs to an online banking user is to send the TAN of the current bank transaction to the user's (GSM) mobile phone via SMS. The SMS text usually quotes the transaction amount and details, the TAN is only valid for a short period of time. Especially in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands many banks have adopted this [[MTAN|\"SMS TAN\"]] service.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 July 2014|title=THE PRAGMATIC REVIEW ON INTERNET BANKING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES IN INDIA|url=https://www.ijccr.com/July2014/20.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computing and Corporate Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There is also \"[[PhotoTAN]]\" service, where the bank generates and sends a QR code image to a smartphone device of the online banking user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/TAN-transaction-authentication-number|title=What is TAN (transaction authentication number)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|website=SearchSecurity|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> \n:Usually online banking with PIN/TAN is done via a web browser using SSL secured connections, so that there is no additional encryption needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.solidpass.com/solutions/online-banking-security.html|title=Online Banking Security|website=www.solidpass.com|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\n* Signature based online banking where all transactions are signed and encrypted digitally. The Keys for the signature generation and encryption can be stored on smartcards or any memory medium, depending on the concrete implementation (see, e.g., the Spanish [[Identification card|ID card]] ''DNI electr\u00f3nico''<ref>[http://www.dnielectronico.es/ DNI electr\u00f3nico de Espa\u00f1a/Spanish ID-card]</ref>).\n\n===Attacks===\nAttacks on online banking used today are based on deceiving the user to steal login data and valid TANs. Two well known examples for those attacks are [[phishing]] and [[pharming]]. [[Cross-site scripting]] and [[keylogger]]/[[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] can also be used to steal login information.\n\nA method to attack signature based online banking methods is to manipulate the used software in a way, that correct transactions are shown on the screen and faked transactions are signed in the background.\n\nA 2008 U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] Technology Incident Report, compiled from suspicious activity reports banks file quarterly, lists 536 cases of computer intrusion, with an average loss per incident of $30,000. That adds up to a nearly $16-million loss in the second quarter of 2007. Computer intrusions increased by 150 percent between the first quarter of 2007 and the second. In 80 percent of the cases, the source of the intrusion is unknown but it occurred during online banking, the report states.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542848/ Security Flaws in Online

[[man-in-the-browser]] attack, a variation of the man-in-the-middle attack where a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] permits a remote attacker to secretly modify the destination account number and also the amount in the web browser.\n\nAs a reaction to advanced security processes allowing the user to cross-check the transaction data on a secure device there are also combined attacks using [[malware]] and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to persuade the user himself to transfer money to the fraudsters on the ground of false claims (like the claim the bank would require a \"test transfer\" or the claim a company had falsely transferred money to the user's account and he should \"send it back\").<ref>[http://www.trusteer.com/blog/tatanga-attack-exposes-chiptan-weaknesses ''Tatanga Attack Exposes chipTAN Weaknesses''] trusteer.com, September 4,

therefore never perform bank transfers they have not initiated themselves.\n\n===Countermeasures===\nThere exist several countermeasures which try to avoid attacks. \n\nWhatever [[operating system]] is used<ref>[https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/online-banking-with-the-most-secure-endpoint-device/ Online banking with the most secure endpoint]</ref>, it is advised that the operating system

consider the PC systems of their users being infected by [[malware]] by default and therefore use security processes where the user can cross-check the transaction data against manipulations like for example (provided the security of the mobile phone holds up) [[MTAN|SMS TAN]] where the transaction data is sent along with the TAN number or standalone smartcard readers with an own screen including the transaction data into the TAN generation process while displaying it beforehand to the user (see [[chipTAN]]) to counter [[man-in-the-middle

Though many talents are limited in scope (called the \"spot-on-a-wall\" variety), the series focuses mainly on individuals with \"Magician\" caliber abilities (one of the criteria for serving as King of Xanth).\n\nIn addition to the human characters, Xanth is populated by [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s, and other fictional beasts. Though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters, some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series.\n\nAs the series progresses, some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents. The centaurs of the primary centaur community, [[Centaur Isle]], exile any centaurs who demonstrate a magical talent (although some centaur communities are more lenient about possession of talent); however, they tolerate talents in \"lesser\" races such as humans. Goblins and harpies are shown to have the potential to possess half-talents, the complementary half existing in a member of the other species, (i.e., a goblin must team with a harpy for them to utilize their talent); the hostility between goblins and harpies proved a major obstacle to any serious effort by them to work together to develop these potential talents. Other non-human species are also known to possess talents, for example: Sesame Serpent and Claire Voyant.  Visitors from other dimensions with talents retain their talents after arriving in Xanth.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nGeographically, modern Xanth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/gap_chasm/mapof.html|title=The Map of Xanth|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> resembles the state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major example of this is the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, [[Lake Okeechobee|Lake Ogre-Chobee]] and the [[Kissimmee River|Kiss-Mee River]]). The [[Florida Keys]] also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual [[key (lock)|key]]s. Other punning feature names include the Isle of View (\"I love you\"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The [[moon]] is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and [[honey]]ish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled [[cheese]], due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear [[fruit]] of all descriptions (pie trees and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the [[Man-eating tree|tangle trees]]), making travel in Xanth risky.\n\nXanth has a connection with the normal world, which is referred to as \"Mundania\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moongadget.com/xanth/index.html|title=Xanthmaker - Piers Anthony Interview - Jitterbug Fantasia|website=moongadget.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> its people are called \"Mundanes\". Although any citizen of Xanth can enter Mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest, Mundanes enter the isthmus in Xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history. In other words, Xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world; and the timeline between Xanth and Mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards. For example, within the lifetime of a normal citizen of Xanth, an American Mundane from {{CURRENTYEAR}} and an Egyptian Mundane from 3000 BC could both walk across the isthmus. However, Mundanes seem to have trouble finding Xanth on a consistent basis, making any travel to Xanth a somewhat rare occurrence. Despite these seeming difficulties, Xanth was colonized in several waves by groups of invaders and nomads from Mundania over the course of several centuries. The series ties these colonization events to actual historical events on [[Earth]], most notably the [[Punic wars]].\n\n===Adult Conspiracy===\n\nFirst mentioned in ''[[Crewel Lye]]'', the Adult Conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the Xanth world. In an interview with Moira Allen, Piers Anthony referred to the \"Adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children\" as a literary device \"parodying current societal conventions\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writing-world.com/sf/anthony.shtml|title=Master of Punmanship: An Interview with Piers Anthony|website=Writing-World.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Nearly all subsequent books contain references to the Conspiracy and its effects, particularly those novels in which the main characters are children.\n\nAt its core, the Adult Conspiracy seeks to protect [[child]]ren from knowledge that could bring them to great harm. The precise age for entering into the world of [[adults]] is age 18, corresponding to the [[age of majority]] in most places. The primary principle that inducts children into the Conspiracy is the understanding of the secret of \"[[Sexual reproduction|summoning the stork]]\". In Xanthian terms, \"summoning the stork\" literally means to put out a call to summon a stork which will deliver to the couple a child. In [[Isle of View]], it is revealed that summoning the stork will release an \"[[ellipsis]]\" (...) into the air to fly off to the stork. This is a play on the joke that all the \"adult\" things happen after a paragraph ends in an ellipsis. Most inductees actually discover the specifics of the act \"by accident\" after marriage, or under the influence of a love spring (a magical spring which causes two drinkers, not necessarily human, or even of the same species, to fall madly, and lustfully, in love with one another at first sight).\n\nOther faculties of the Adult Conspiracy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://litrpgreads.com/blog/piers-anthony-magic-xanth|title=Piers Anthony: The Magic of Xanth - LitRPG Reads|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> include:\n*[[Censorship]] of [[Profanity|foul language]] &ndash; All foul words contain the ability to cause various effects (the wilting of plants (negative), removal of curse burrs (positive), etc.). These are automatically [[Thomas Bowdler|bleeped]] when said in the presence of someone who has yet to be inducted.\n*Visual access to underwear &ndash; Because [[underwear]] is so closely tied to [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (even more so than nudity in Xanth), men become automatically \"freaked out\" when they view panties. This is made a common joke, most prominently in the novel ''[[The Color of Her Panties]]'', and is often used by women to gain advantage over men. Panties only carry their effects when worn, but because of their nature, they are forbidden to be shown to children.\n*Inability to have childish fun &ndash; Children believe that once they join the Adult Conspiracy, they will no longer have pillow fights, eat sweets and drink \"tsoda popka\" ([[Soft drink|soda pop]]), or want to have [[fun]]. While this belief is exaggerated, the entry to the Conspiracy does cause the couple to lose their bed monster, inadvertently creating the appearance of losing all childhood spirit under the responsibility of Adulthood.\n\nIt is important to note that there have been occasions when children gained access to the Adult Conspiracy prematurely. Jenny Elf, Che Centaur, and Gwenny Goblin had to be given access to the Adult Conspiracy when Gwenny received a pair of [[contact lens]]es that corrected her poor [[eyesight]] while giving her the ability to see others' [[dream]]s (some of which could contain Conspiracy material). In one rare instance, a little girl was born with the magic talent of immunity to the magical censorship of Adult Conspiracy, causing her family much distress. This was remedied with magician Sherlock's talent of reversal and a vial of [[lethe]] water which erased her [[memory]].\n\n===Mundania===\nWhenever Xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of Xanth, called Mundania, its natives (Mundanes) speak what sounds like gibberish to the Xanth characters. The gibberish can be translated by a simple replacement [[cipher]], depending on the Mundane language being spoken. Often the language is a simple shift in the alphabet, a letter or two forwards or backwards (see [[Caesar cipher]]).\n\n=== Curse fiends ===\n\nCurse fiends, who call themselves \"curse friends,\" are known for their talent to throw curses at their enemies. They are believed to be the primary cause of several different settings in Xanth: 1) the land of Air, 2) the land of Earth, 3) the land of Fire, 4) the land of Water (also called the Water Wing), and 5) the Void. The story about how these regions were created is described in ''[[Demons Don't Dream]]''.\n\nThe curse fiends in the present day Xanth stay close to their own community where they put on plays. Because of this, they are widely known for their acting skills.\n\n==Related works==\n*''Encyclopedia of Xanth'' (1987, by [[Jody Lynn Nye]]) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' (1988, by Jody Lynn Nye) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth'' (1989, with Jody Lynn Nye)\n* \"Xanth\" Board Game (1991, created by Mayfair Games, a board game for 1-6 players set in the Xanth Universe)\n*''[[Companions of Xanth]]'' (a 1993 [[video game]] described in and following the plot of ''Demons Don't Dream'')\n*''[[Letters to Jenny]]'' (1993, nonfiction)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/bibliography.html Piers Anthony's Bibliography List]\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' ({{ISBN|0-8125-6450-2}}) (1988) by Jody Lyn Nye (A Crossroads Adventure in the World of Piers Anthony's Xanth)\n*''Bio of an Ogre'' ({{ISBN|0-441-06225-3}}) (1988) by Piers Anthony (Xanth: Part Five: Number 4 p.&nbsp;213)\n{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/xanth.html Xanth on Hipiers.com]\n* The [http://us.macmillan.com/series/Xanth Xanth] series page at [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (parent company of [[Tor Books]])\n*{{isfdb series|id=581|title=Xanth}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050429183315/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/12/07/xanth/index.html ''I was a captive of Xanth''] a review of the long-lived series from [[Salon.com|Salon]] (December 7, 2000)\n*[http://www.piers-anthony.com/xanthtimeline.html The timeline of Xanth]\n\n{{Xanth}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Xanth| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional countries]]\n[[Category:Zombies and revenants in popular culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox fictional location\n| name         = Xanth\n| image        =\n| image_size   =\n| alt          =\n| caption      =\n| source       = ''The Magic of Xanth''\n| alt_name     =\n| first        = ''[[A Spell for Chameleon]]''\n| last         = ''[[Fire Sail]]''\n| creator      = [[Piers Anthony]]\n| genre        = fantasy\n| type         = [[fantasy world]]\n| located_in   =\n| ruler        = [[Magician Trent]]\n| locations    =\n| ethnic_group =\n| races        = [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s\n| characters   =\n| population   =\n}}\n'''Xanth''' ({{IPAc-en|'|z|\u00e6|n|\u03b8}} {{respell|ZANTH|'}}) is a [[fantasy world]] created by author [[Piers Anthony]] for his ''Xanth'' series of novels, also known as ''The Magic of Xanth''.

Though many talents are limited in scope (called the \"spot-on-a-wall\" variety), the series focuses mainly on individuals with \"Magician\" caliber abilities (one of the criteria for serving as King of Xanth).\n\nIn addition to the human characters, Xanth is populated by [[Elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[demon]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[faun]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[golem]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[merfolk (disambiguation)|merfolk]], [[naga (mythology)|naga]], [[nymph]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[Xanth#Curse_Fiends|curse fiend]]s, and other fictional beasts. Though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters, some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series.\n\nAs the series progresses, some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents. The centaurs of the primary centaur community, [[Centaur Isle]], exile any centaurs who demonstrate a magical talent (although some centaur communities are more lenient about possession of talent); however, they tolerate talents in \"lesser\" races such as humans. Goblins and harpies are shown to have the potential to possess half-talents, the complementary half existing in a member of the other species, (i.e., a goblin must team with a harpy for them to utilize their talent); the hostility between goblins and harpies proved a major obstacle to any serious effort by them to work together to develop these potential talents. Other non-human species are also known to possess talents, for example: Sesame Serpent and Claire Voyant.  Visitors from other dimensions with talents retain their talents after arriving in Xanth.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nGeographically, modern Xanth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/gap_chasm/mapof.html|title=The Map of Xanth|website=members.tripod.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> resembles the state of Florida in the United States in shape, but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world. One major example of this is the Gap Chasm, an enormous canyon a mile wide which completely bisects the country, paralleling the DMZ of the Korean Peninsula. The position of the Chasm could also correspond with the [[Cross Florida Barge Canal]], which, similar to the chasm, is generally forgotten except for those who stumble upon it. The Gap is guarded by a resident dragon, known as Stanley Steamer, and is crossed by means of treacherous bridges. Many of Xanth's other geographical features are puns on those of Florida (for example, [[Lake Okeechobee|Lake Ogre-Chobee]] and the [[Kissimmee River|Kiss-Mee River]]). The [[Florida Keys]] also exist, though they are, in Xanth, actual [[key (lock)|key]]s. Other punning feature names include the Isle of View (\"I love you\"), Mount Ever-Rest (Mount Everest) and the Centaur Aisle (center aisle) created by a magician from the Centaur Isle. The [[moon]] is close enough that flying creatures may land there; the back side is sweet and [[honey]]ish, the visible side has turned sour and become curdled [[cheese]], due to observing what has happened on Earth and Xanth. Plants may bear [[fruit]] of all descriptions (pie trees and shoe trees are common) or they may be carnivorous (such as the [[Man-eating tree|tangle trees]]), making travel in Xanth risky.\n\nXanth has a connection with the normal world, which is referred to as \"Mundania\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moongadget.com/xanth/index.html|title=Xanthmaker - Piers Anthony Interview - Jitterbug Fantasia|website=moongadget.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> its people are called \"Mundanes\". Although any citizen of Xanth can enter Mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest, Mundanes enter the isthmus in Xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history. In other words, Xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world; and the timeline between Xanth and Mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards. For example, within the lifetime of a normal citizen of Xanth, an American Mundane from {{CURRENTYEAR}} and an Egyptian Mundane from 3000 BC could both walk across the isthmus. However, Mundanes seem to have trouble finding Xanth on a consistent basis, making any travel to Xanth a somewhat rare occurrence. Despite these seeming difficulties, Xanth was colonized in several waves by groups of invaders and nomads from Mundania over the course of several centuries. The series ties these colonization events to actual historical events on [[Earth]], most notably the [[Punic wars]].\n\n===Adult Conspiracy===\n\nFirst mentioned in ''[[Crewel Lye]]'', the Adult Conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the Xanth world. In an interview with Moira Allen, Piers Anthony referred to the \"Adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children\" as a literary device \"parodying current societal conventions\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writing-world.com/sf/anthony.shtml|title=Master of Punmanship: An Interview with Piers Anthony|website=Writing-World.com|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Nearly all subsequent books contain references to the Conspiracy and its effects, particularly those novels in which the main characters are children.\n\nAt its core, the Adult Conspiracy seeks to protect [[child]]ren from knowledge that could bring them to great harm. The precise age for entering into the world of [[adults]] is age 18, corresponding to the [[age of majority]] in most places. The primary principle that inducts children into the Conspiracy is the understanding of the secret of \"[[Sexual reproduction|summoning the stork]]\". In Xanthian terms, \"summoning the stork\" literally means to put out a call to summon a stork which will deliver to the couple a child. In [[Isle of View]], it is revealed that summoning the stork will release an \"[[ellipsis]]\" (...) into the air to fly off to the stork. This is a play on the joke that all the \"adult\" things happen after a paragraph ends in an ellipsis. Most inductees actually discover the specifics of the act \"by accident\" after marriage, or under the influence of a love spring (a magical spring which causes two drinkers, not necessarily human, or even of the same species, to fall madly, and lustfully, in love with one another at first sight).\n\nOther faculties of the Adult Conspiracy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://litrpgreads.com/blog/piers-anthony-magic-xanth|title=Piers Anthony: The Magic of Xanth - LitRPG Reads|date=13 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> include:\n*[[Censorship]] of [[Profanity|foul language]] &ndash; All foul words contain the ability to cause various effects (the wilting of plants (negative), removal of curse burrs (positive), etc.). These are automatically [[Thomas Bowdler|bleeped]] when said in the presence of someone who has yet to be inducted.\n*Visual access to underwear &ndash; Because [[underwear]] is so closely tied to [[human sexuality|sexuality]] (even more so than nudity in Xanth), men become automatically \"freaked out\" when they view panties. This is made a common joke, most prominently in the novel ''[[The Color of Her Panties]]'', and is often used by women to gain advantage over men. Panties only carry their effects when worn, but because of their nature, they are forbidden to be shown to children.\n*Inability to have childish fun &ndash; Children believe that once they join the Adult Conspiracy, they will no longer have pillow fights, eat sweets and drink \"tsoda popka\" ([[Soft drink|soda pop]]), or want to have [[fun]]. While this belief is exaggerated, the entry to the Conspiracy does cause the couple to lose their bed monster, inadvertently creating the appearance of losing all childhood spirit under the responsibility of Adulthood.\n\nIt is important to note that there have been occasions when children gained access to the Adult Conspiracy prematurely. Jenny Elf, Che Centaur, and Gwenny Goblin had to be given access to the Adult Conspiracy when Gwenny received a pair of [[contact lens]]es that corrected her poor [[eyesight]] while giving her the ability to see others' [[dream]]s (some of which could contain Conspiracy material). In one rare instance, a little girl was born with the magic talent of immunity to the magical censorship of Adult Conspiracy, causing her family much distress. This was remedied with magician Sherlock's talent of reversal and a vial of [[lethe]] water which erased her [[memory]].\n\n===Mundania===\nWhenever Xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of Xanth, called Mundania, its natives (Mundanes) speak what sounds like gibberish to the Xanth characters. The gibberish can be translated by a simple replacement [[cipher]], depending on the Mundane language being spoken. Often the language is a simple shift in the alphabet, a letter or two forwards or backwards (see [[Caesar cipher]]).\n\n=== Curse fiends ===\n\nCurse fiends, who call themselves \"curse friends,\" are known for their talent to throw curses at their enemies. They are believed to be the primary cause of several different settings in Xanth: 1) the land of Air, 2) the land of Earth, 3) the land of Fire, 4) the land of Water (also called the Water Wing), and 5) the Void. The story about how these regions were created is described in ''[[Demons Don't Dream]]''.\n\nThe curse fiends in the present day Xanth stay close to their own community where they put on plays. Because of this, they are widely known for their acting skills.\n\n==Related works==\n*''Encyclopedia of Xanth'' (1987, by [[Jody Lynn Nye]]) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' (1988, by Jody Lynn Nye) a Crossroads Adventure role-playing game book\n*''Piers Anthony's Visual Guide to Xanth'' (1989, with Jody Lynn Nye)\n* \"Xanth\" Board Game (1991, created by Mayfair Games, a board game for 1-6 players set in the Xanth Universe)\n*''[[Companions of Xanth]]'' (a 1993 [[video game]] described in and following the plot of ''Demons Don't Dream'')\n*''[[Letters to Jenny]]'' (1993, nonfiction)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/bibliography.html Piers Anthony's Bibliography List]\n*''Ghost of a Chance'' ({{ISBN|0-8125-6450-2}}) (1988) by Jody Lyn Nye (A Crossroads Adventure in the World of Piers Anthony's Xanth)\n*''Bio of an Ogre'' ({{ISBN|0-441-06225-3}}) (1988) by Piers Anthony (Xanth: Part Five: Number 4 p.&nbsp;213)\n{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hipiers.com/xanth.html Xanth on Hipiers.com]\n* The [http://us.macmillan.com/series/Xanth Xanth] series page at [[Tor Books]]\n*{{isfdb series|id=581|title=Xanth}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050429183315/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/12/07/xanth/index.html ''I was a captive of Xanth''] a review of the long-lived series from [[Salon.com|Salon]] (December 7, 2000)\n*[http://www.piers-anthony.com/xanthtimeline.html The timeline of Xanth]\n\n{{Xanth}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Xanth| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional countries]]\n[[Category:Zombies and revenants in popular culture]]\n", "name_user": "DeNoel", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Corrected link description based on accessdate=18 April 2020.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth"}
