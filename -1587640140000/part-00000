While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

After two seasons there, he was hired in 1973 by the [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] to become its head coach. Vitale took [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|Detroit]] to the 32-team NCAA tournament in [[1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]]. Vitale had a 78\u201330 record during his tenure at Detroit, which included a 21-game winning streak during the 1977 season. During that streak the Titans defeated the eventual champion [[1976\u201377 Marquette Warriors men's basketball team|Marquette]], [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena|on the road]], in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. Following the 1977 season, his fourth as Detroit head coach, Vitale was named the university's [[athletic director]].\n\n===NBA coaching===\nVitale coached the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] for the 1978\u201379 season, leading them to a 30\u201352 (.366) record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pistons Coaching Records |url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/alltime_coaching_records.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202135250/http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/alltime_coaching_records.html |archivedate=2009-12-02 }}</ref> On November 8, 1979, Pistons owner [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|Bill Davidson]] came to Vitale's house and told him that the Pistons were making a coaching change. It was twelve games into the 1979\u201380 season, after the Pistons struggled to a 4\u20138 start. The primary reason for Vitale's downfall with the Pistons was the maneuver that brought [[Bob McAdoo]] to Detroit. [[M.L. Carr]]'s decision to sign with [[Boston Celtics|Boston]] as a free agent in 1979 spawned a transaction in which the Pistons, entitled to compensation for Carr, demanded Bob McAdoo, whom the Celtics were looking to unload due to injuries. The Pistons sent two 1980 first-round draft picks (in addition to Carr) to the Celtics in exchange for McAdoo in a combination free agent signing/trade. The Pistons would have the worst season in franchise history in 1979\u201380, and their pick would become the first overall pick in the [[1980 NBA Draft|1980 draft]]. Boston then traded the two picks to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] (who selected [[Joe Barry Carroll]] with the #1 pick and [[Rickey Brown]] with the #13 pick) in exchange for [[Robert Parish]] and the #3 pick ([[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nVitale married Lorraine McGrath in 1971.

His first reaction to the job of broadcaster was \"Absolutely no way. I know nothing about TV. I want to get back to where I belong and my spirit belongs.\" He was reluctant to accept the position but his wife Lorraine told him to \"go on TV and have some fun,\" so Vitale accepted on a temporary basis until another coaching job became available. He called ESPN's first [[college basketball]] game on December 5, 1979, when [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] defeated [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] 90\u201377.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vitale's first broadcast| url = http://www.jsonline.com/sports/39534602.html}}</ref> His first play-by-play partner was Joe Boyle.\n\nVitale was not a natural at first for broadcasting. He missed his first-ever production meeting when he was walking the streets of [[Chicago]]. Also, he would talk while the producers were talking to him through his earpiece, during commercials, and while the play-by-play man was talking. Vitale himself was not sure if broadcasting would fit him. Connal, who had hired him, told him, \"You have a quality we can't teach.\" Vitale did not understand this until many people wanted his autograph at the 1983 Final Four. He credits a lot of his success to working with [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] at the beginning of his career.\n\nIn 1985, after the [[American Broadcasting Company]] acquired ESPN, Vitale also began doing broadcasts on the ABC network.\n\nIn 1999, Vitale was featured in a series of thirty-second promo shorts for \"Hoops Malone\".  The shorts, which aired in heavy rotation on ESPN, were presented as a sitcom featuring Vitale, [[George Gervin]] and others, including a puppet called \"O'Hoolix\".  ESPN promoted \"Hoops\" with banners and other marketing premiums, with the idea of generating buzz about the show, but no actual episodes were ever produced.  Though this led to an offer for Vitale to do an actual sitcom, he turned down the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2002, Vitale called a [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School|St. Vincent \u2013 St. Mary's]]\u2013[[Oak Hill Academy (Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] prep game, featuring then high school phenom [[LeBron James]]. He announced the game with [[Brad Nessler]] and NBA great [[Bill Walton]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://usatoday.com/sports/columnist/martzke/2002-12-04-martzke_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Packer vexed at Vitale for doing prep star's game | date=December 4, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 2004\u201305 season, Vitale was doing approximately 40 games a year.<ref>{{cite web| title=TV/RADIO: Hoops boosts Vitale's vitality| url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml| access-date=2009-03-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706091318/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml#| archive-date=2015-07-06| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nVitale is signed with ESPN through the 2021\u201322 college basketball season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Vitale agrees to contract extension with ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13044327/dick-vitale-agrees-contract-extension-espn|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=2015-06-09}}</ref> Vitale was recruited to do color in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament by [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS]] but ESPN would not allow it. However, ESPN's analysts [[Jay Bilas]] and [[Len Elmore]] were allowed to provide color for CBS's tournament coverage, teaming with play-by-play announcers [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]]. However, this is slightly misleading as Elmore continues to call games for both CBS and ESPN during the college basketball season; in Bilas' case he was loaned to CBS for the tournament only in 2003 and from 2005\u20132010.\n\nIn February 2015, ESPN removed Vitale from covering [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]-[[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|UNC]] basketball. He had covered every Duke-UNC game televised by ESPN since 1979.<ref> http://www.diehardsport.com/college-basketball/espn-taken-dick-vitale-off-broadcast-unc-duke-game/</ref>\n\nVitale is a voter on the [[Associated Press|AP]] Top 25 men's basketball polls, the annual [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] and the [[John Wooden Award]].\n\nVitale called his first NBA game on television since the 1984 NBA playoffs, along with [[Dan Shulman]], on January 7, 2009 when the Miami Heat played the Denver Nuggets as ESPN swapped its NBA and NCAA crews. During ESPN's first incarnation covering the NBA, he regularly covered games.\n\n===Broadcasting partners===\nAs of 2009, Vitale had called close to a thousand games. Vitale, a [[color commentator]], is primarily paired with play-by-play announcers [[Mike Patrick]], primarily those in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] games; and [[Dan Shulman]] for [[Saturday Primetime]] and other non-ACC games. During the postseason, he appears as an in-studio analyst with host [[Rece Davis]] and fellow analysts [[Jay Bilas]], [[Digger Phelps]], [[Hubert Davis]], and [[Bob Knight]].

After two seasons there, he was hired in 1973 by the [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] to become its head coach. Vitale took [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|Detroit]] to the 32-team NCAA tournament in [[1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]]. Vitale had a 78\u201330 record during his tenure at Detroit, which included a 21-game winning streak during the 1977 season.

It was twelve games into the 1979\u201380 season, after the Pistons struggled to a 4\u20138 start. The primary reason for Vitale's downfall with the Pistons was the maneuver that brought [[Bob McAdoo]] to Detroit. [[M.L. Carr]]'s decision to sign with [[Boston Celtics|Boston]] as a free agent in 1979 spawned a transaction in which the Pistons, entitled to compensation for Carr, demanded Bob McAdoo, whom the Celtics were looking to unload due to injuries. The Pistons sent two 1980 first-round draft picks (in addition to Carr) to the Celtics in exchange for McAdoo in a combination free agent signing/trade. The Pistons would have the worst season in franchise history in 1979\u201380, and their pick would become the first overall pick in the [[1980 NBA Draft|1980 draft]]. Boston then traded the two picks to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] (who selected [[Joe Barry Carroll]] with the #1 pick and [[Rickey Brown]] with the #13 pick) in exchange for [[Robert Parish]] and the #3 pick ([[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]).\n\n==Personal life==\n\nVitale married Lorraine McGrath in 1971.

His first reaction to the job of broadcaster was \"Absolutely no way. I know nothing about TV. I want to get back to where I belong and my spirit belongs.\" He was reluctant to accept the position but his wife Lorraine told him to \"go on TV and have some fun,\" so Vitale accepted on a temporary basis until another coaching job became available. He called ESPN's first [[college basketball]] game on December 5, 1979, when [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] defeated [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] 90\u201377.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vitale's first broadcast| url = http://www.jsonline.com/sports/39534602.html}}</ref> His first play-by-play partner was Joe Boyle.\n\nVitale was not a natural at first for broadcasting. He missed his first-ever production meeting when he was walking the streets of [[Chicago]]. Also, he would talk while the producers were talking to him through his earpiece, during commercials, and while the play-by-play man was talking. Vitale himself was not sure if broadcasting would fit him. Connal, who had hired him, told him, \"You have a quality we can't teach.\" Vitale did not understand this until many people wanted his autograph at the 1983 Final Four. He credits a lot of his success to working with [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] at the beginning of his career.\n\nIn 1985, after the [[American Broadcasting Company]] acquired ESPN, Vitale also began doing broadcasts on the ABC network.\n\nIn 1999, Vitale was featured in a series of thirty-second promo shorts for \"Hoops Malone\".  The shorts, which aired in heavy rotation on ESPN, were presented as a sitcom featuring Vitale, [[George Gervin]] and others, including a puppet called \"O'Hoolix\".  ESPN promoted \"Hoops\" with banners and other marketing premiums, with the idea of generating buzz about the show, but no actual episodes were ever produced.  Though this led to an offer for Vitale to do an actual sitcom, he turned down the opportunity.\n\nIn December 2002, Vitale called a [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School|St. Vincent \u2013 St. Mary's]]\u2013[[Oak Hill Academy (Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] prep game, featuring then high school phenom [[LeBron James]]. He announced the game with [[Brad Nessler]] and NBA great [[Bill Walton]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://usatoday.com/sports/columnist/martzke/2002-12-04-martzke_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Packer vexed at Vitale for doing prep star's game | date=December 4, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 2004\u201305 season, Vitale was doing approximately 40 games a year.<ref>{{cite web| title=TV/RADIO: Hoops boosts Vitale's vitality| url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml| access-date=2009-03-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706091318/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml#| archive-date=2015-07-06| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nVitale is signed with ESPN through the 2021\u201322 college basketball season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Vitale agrees to contract extension with ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13044327/dick-vitale-agrees-contract-extension-espn|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=2015-06-09}}</ref> Vitale was recruited to do color in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament by [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS]] but ESPN would not allow it. However, ESPN's analysts [[Jay Bilas]] and [[Len Elmore]] were allowed to provide color for CBS's tournament coverage, teaming with play-by-play announcers [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]]. However, this is slightly misleading as Elmore continues to call games for both CBS and ESPN during the college basketball season; in Bilas' case he was loaned to CBS for the tournament only in 2003 and from 2005\u20132010.\n\nIn February 2015, ESPN removed Vitale from covering [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]-[[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|UNC]] basketball. He had covered every Duke-UNC game televised by ESPN since 1979.<ref> http://www.diehardsport.com/college-basketball/espn-taken-dick-vitale-off-broadcast-unc-duke-game/</ref>\n\nVitale is a voter on the [[Associated Press|AP]] Top 25 men's basketball polls, the annual [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] and the [[John Wooden Award]].\n\nVitale called his first NBA game on television since the 1984 NBA playoffs, along with [[Dan Shulman]], on January 7, 2009 when the Miami Heat played the Denver Nuggets as ESPN swapped its NBA and NCAA crews. During ESPN's first incarnation covering the NBA, he regularly covered games.\n\n===Broadcasting partners===\nAs of 2009, Vitale had called close to a thousand games. Vitale, a [[color commentator]], is primarily paired with play-by-play announcers [[Mike Patrick]], primarily those in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] games; and [[Dan Shulman]] for [[Saturday Primetime]] and other non-ACC games. During the postseason, he appears as an in-studio analyst with host [[Rece Davis]] and fellow analysts [[Jay Bilas]], [[Digger Phelps]], [[Hubert Davis]], and [[Bob Knight]].

It is Japan's [[List of Japanese cities by population|fourth-largest incorporated city]] and the third-most-populous urban area. It is located on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast on central [[Honshu]]. It is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Aichi Prefecture]] and is one of Japan's major [[seaport|port]]s along with those of [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Kobe]], [[Yokohama]], [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], and [[Kitakyushu]].

One possible origin is the adjective {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b|nagoyaka}}, meaning 'peaceful'. [http://chimei-allguide.com/23/100.html]\n\nThe name {{Nihongo3||\u4e2d\u4eac|Ch\u016bky\u014d}}, consisting of ''ch\u016b'' (middle) + ''ky\u014d'' (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area]], [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area]], [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting]], [[Chukyo University]] and the [[Chukyo Racecourse]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Nagoya}}\n\n=== Origin ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n[[Oda Nobunaga]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of [[Owari Province]] from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers ({{convert|7|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\n\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the [[Battle of Okehazama]] took place in Dengakuhazama, [[Owari Province]] which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, [[Oda Nobunaga]] defeated [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]] and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>A Military History of Japan by John Kuehn p. 102</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Atsuta Shrine.jpg|The Great [[Atsuta Shrine]], which dates back to c. 100 AD and houses the holy sword [[Kusanagi]], one of the imperial regalia of Japan\nFile:Osu_Kannon_panorama.jpg|[[\u014csu Kannon]] is a Buddhist temple, originally built in 1333\nFile:Bish\u016b Okehazama-gassen.jpg|[[Battle of Okehazama]] (May\u2013June, 1560)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period [[Nagoya Castle]] was constructed, built partly from materials taken from [[Kiyosu Castle]]. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kiyosu Castle |url=http://www.city.kiyosu.aichi.jp/en/sightseeing01.html |accessdate=2007-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209191819/http://www.city.kiyosu.aichi.jp/en/sightseeing01.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 }}</ref> Around the same time, the nearby ancient [[Atsuta Shrine]] was designated as a [[:wikt:waystation|waystation]], called Miya (the Shrine), on the important [[T\u014dkaid\u014d (road)|T\u014dkaid\u014d]] road, which linked the two capitals of [[Kyoto]] and [[Edo]] (now Tokyo).

Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]].\n\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]] towns of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname]], [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]] and [[Seto, Aichi|Seto]], as well as [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], one of the only places where [[gunpowder]] was produced under the [[shogunate]]. Other industries included [[cotton]] and complex mechanical dolls called ''[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]''.\n\n[[Mitsubishi Aircraft Company]] was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Nagoya Station 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Nagoya Station]] in 1886\nFile:Nagoya-Hirokoji_in_the_Meiji_era.JPG|Hirokoji in Nagoya during the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]]\nFile:\u5fa1\u5927\u5178\u5949\u795d\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a \u6b63\u9580.jpg|thumb|Main Gate of the Nagoya Expo in [[Tsuruma Park]], 1928\nFile:Nagoya map circa 1930.PNG|thumb|Nagoya map circa 1930\nFile:Toyota Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Toyota]] Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938\nFile:TBCN Kakunai Line.JPG|Nagoya in the [[Showa period]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of [[Bombing of Nagoya in World War II|US air raids]] during [[World War II]]. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of [[Kakamigahara, Gifu|Kagamigahara]]. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during [[World War II]].\n\nAir raids began on [[April 18, 1942]], with an [[Doolittle Raid|attack]] on a [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant.<ref>''The First Heroes'' by Craig Nelson</ref> The [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II|bombing]]<nowiki/> continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale [[firebombing]]. Nagoya was the target of two of [[Bomber Command]]\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated {{convert|5.9|mi2|1|abbr=out|order=flip}} . The [[XXI Bomber Command]] established a new [[U.S. Army Air Force]] record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries.

The city was built on low-level [[plateau]]s to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The [[Kiso River]] flows to the west along the city border, and the [[Sh\u014dnai River]] comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made [[Hori River (Nagoya)|Hori River]] was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\n\nThe city's location and its position in the [[Ch\u016bbu region|centre of Japan]] allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n=== Wards ===\n[[File:Nagoya_City_Hall_2011-10-28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nagoya City Hall]]]]\n\nNagoya has 16 [[Wards of Japan|wards]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Wards of Nagoya\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!Map of Nagoya \n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!Population\n!''Land area in km<sup>2</sup>''\n!Pop. density\nper km2\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya|Atsuta-ku]]\n|\u71b1\u7530\u533a\n|Blue\n|66,318\n|8.20\n|8,088\n| rowspan=\"16\" |[[File:Nagoya_Wards.png|center|border|400px|A map of Nagoya's Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Chikusa-ku, Nagoya|Chikusa-ku]]\n| \u5343\u7a2e\u533a\n|Brown\n|165,863\n|18.18\n|9,123\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Higashi-ku, Nagoya|Higashi-ku]]\n| \u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|82,939\n|7.71\n|10,757\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita-ku]]\n| \u5317\u533a\n|Purple\n|163,555\n|17.53\n|9,330\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Meit\u014d-ku, Nagoya|Meit\u014d-ku]]\n| \u540d\u6771\u533a\n|Dark blue\n|165,287\n|19.45\n|8,498\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Midori-ku, Nagoya|Midori-ku]]\n| \u7dd1\u533a\n|Light red\n|247,475\n|37.91\n|6,528\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Minami-ku, Nagoya|Minami-ku]]\n| \u5357\u533a\n|Orange\n|136,015\n|18.46\n|7,368\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Minato-ku, Nagoya|Minato-ku]]\n| \u6e2f\u533a\n|Intense Green\n|143,913\n|45.64\n|3,153\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Mizuho-ku, Nagoya|Mizuho-ku]]\n|\u745e\u7a42\u533a\n|Dark purple\n|107,622\n|11.22\n|9,592\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[Moriyama-ku, Nagoya|Moriyama-ku]]\n|\u5b88\u5c71\u533a\n|Light green\n|176,298\n|34.01\n|5,184\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 11\n|[[Naka-ku, Nagoya|Naka-ku]] - administrative center\n|\u4e2d\u533a\n|Green\n|90,918\n|9.38\n|9,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 12\n|[[Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya|Nakagawa-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u5ddd\u533a\n|Pink\n|220,782\n|32.02\n|6,895\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 13\n|[[Nakamura-ku, Nagoya|Nakamura-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u6751\u533a\n|Light blue\n|135,134\n|16.30\n|8,290\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 14\n|[[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]]\n|\u897f\u533a\n|Dark orange\n|150,480\n|17.93\n|8,393\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 15\n|[[Sh\u014dwa-ku, Nagoya|Sh\u014dwa-ku]]\n|\u662d\u548c\u533a\n|Yellow\n|110,436\n|10.94\n|10,095\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 16\n|[[Tenpaku-ku]]\n|\u5929\u767d\u533a\n|Cyan\n|164,522\n|21.58\n|7,624\n|}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Meieki_from_Heiwa_Park_Aqua_Tower.jpg|Nagoya City skyline seen from Heiwa Koen Aqua Tower\nFile:Nagoya_(2015-11-03).JPG|Nagoya in 2015\nFile:Nagoya 2017 (34159008173).jpg|Nagoya city night view\nFile:2016 Japan Nagoya 81 (33038233234).jpg|[[Sakae, Nagoya|Downtown of Sakae Town]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters.

Before and during the [[Edo period]] there were two main kilns in the region: [[Seto ware|Seto]] and [[Tokoname ware|Tokoname]]. In Nagoya Castle a type of ''oniwa-yaki'' (literally \"garden ware\") called [[Ofukei ware]] was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own ''oniwa-yaki'', also to have gifts made. In the town itself [[Toyoraku ware]] and [[Sasashima ware]] [[Japanese tea utensils]] were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord [[Tokugawa Yoshinao]] and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the [[Edo period]]. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as [[Hirasawa Kur\u014d]] and [[Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d]], who made their own pieces.\n\nToyoraku ware continued on until the [[Taish\u014d era]] under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\n\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white [[Kawana ware]]. With the advent of industrialisation during the [[Meiji era]] of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old [[Noritake]], also ''Nagoya E-tsuke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8}}) became popular.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214810/http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |archive-date=2018-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nProduction of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as [[INAX]], [[NGK]], and [[NGK Insulators]].\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]\", are a traditional craft from the area.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially [[Tokugawa Muneharu]], the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\n\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the ''[[Shoin-zukuri]]'' architecture of the feudal era. [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated [[national Treasures of Japan]], including some of the oldest scrolls of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamasa.org's Tokugawa Art Museum page |url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/aichi/tokugawa_artmuseum.html}}</ref> The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of [[Noh theatre]]. The [[Nagoya City Museum]] showcases the history of the town.\n\n[[Y\u014dki-s\u014d]] is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of [[Matsuzakaya]].\n\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the [[Nagoya City Art Museum]]. Modern art is displayed at the [[Aichi Arts Center]]. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], a sister museum to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\n\nThe art of [[porcelain]] and ceramics can be seen at the [[Noritake Garden]]. Toyota has two museums in the city, the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] which shows vintage cars, and the [[Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]], which showcases company history, including its start as a [[textile mill]].\n\nThe [[Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum]] has trams and subway cars, as well as the [[Nagoya City Science Museum]]. The [[SCMaglev and Railway Park]] opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.\n\nOther art museums in Aichi prefecture are the [[Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum]] and the [[Toyota Municipal Museum of Art]]. [[Meiji Mura]] is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the [[Mandolin Melodies Museum]].\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[International Design Centre Nagoya]], the [[Japan Spinning Top Museum]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum]].\n\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"[[Cultural Path]]\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n=== Theatres ===\n[[Noh]] theatre and [[Ky\u014dgen]] date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The [[Nagoya Noh Theater]] at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\n\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's ''[[kabuki]]'' grand stages is [[Misono-za]], which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\n\nIn 1912, the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the [[Nagoya harp]] music instrument.\n\nIn 1992, the large, modern [[Aichi Arts Center]] was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for [[performing art]]s, featuring a main hall that can be used for [[opera]] and theatre and a concert hall. The [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] and holidays, other [[festivals in Nagoya]] are unique to the city/region.\n\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the {{Nihongo|''Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri''|\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d|Street Performer's Festival}} in \u014csu.\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe {{nihongo|[[Nagoya dialect]]|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01|Nagoya-ben}} is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called {{Nihongo|Owari dialect|\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01|Owari-ben}}. The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to [[Japanese language#Official status|standard Japanese]] and to the [[Kansai dialect]], differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of [[Japanese handicrafts]] in the city is centuries old.\n* Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from [[Bungo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\n* ''[[Geta (footwear)|Geta]]'' [[Clog (shoe)|clog]] straps: wooden clogs called ''geta'' were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\n* ''Shippo'': the technique for [[enamelware]] called ''shippo'' arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\n* Candles: [[wax]] is taken from a [[wax tree]] and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (''[[washi]]'') over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the [[Candle wick|wick]] tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\n* ''Yuzen'': the art of [[silk]] dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\n* ''Sekku Ningyo'': festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\n* The city also gave its name to a type of ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', the sash that is used to tie a ''[[kimono]]''. The term ''Nagoya obi'' can refer to an older type of ''obi'' used centuries ago. This type was cord-like.<ref name=\"yoshino\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |title=Kimono |author=Yoshino Antiques |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326233826/http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 }}</ref> The current {{Nihongo3||\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|Nagoya obi}} \u2013 or to differentiate from the ''fukuro Nagoya obi'', also called {{Nihongo3||\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi|extra=\"nine-inch nagoya obi\"}} \u2013 is the most-used ''obi'' type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The ''Nagoya obi'' was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear.

One possible origin is the adjective {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b|nagoyaka}}, meaning 'peaceful'.

In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of [[Owari Province]] from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers ({{convert|7|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\n\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the [[Battle of Okehazama]] took place in Dengakuhazama, [[Owari Province]] which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, [[Oda Nobunaga]] defeated [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]] and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>A Military History of Japan by John Kuehn p. 102</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Atsuta Shrine.jpg|The Great [[Atsuta Shrine]], which dates back to c. 100 AD and houses the holy sword [[Kusanagi]], one of the imperial regalia of Japan\nFile:Osu_Kannon_panorama.jpg|[[\u014csu Kannon]] is a Buddhist temple, originally built in 1333\nFile:Bish\u016b Okehazama-gassen.jpg|[[Battle of Okehazama]] (May\u2013June, 1560)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period [[Nagoya Castle]] was constructed, built partly from materials taken from [[Kiyosu Castle]].

Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]].\n\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]] towns of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname]], [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]] and [[Seto, Aichi|Seto]], as well as [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], one of the only places where [[gunpowder]] was produced under the [[shogunate]]. Other industries included [[cotton]] and complex mechanical dolls called ''[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]''.\n\n[[Mitsubishi Aircraft Company]] was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Nagoya Station 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Nagoya Station]] in 1886\nFile:Nagoya-Hirokoji_in_the_Meiji_era.JPG|Hirokoji in Nagoya during the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]]\nFile:\u5fa1\u5927\u5178\u5949\u795d\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a \u6b63\u9580.jpg|thumb|Main Gate of the Nagoya Expo in [[Tsuruma Park]], 1928\nFile:Nagoya map circa 1930.PNG|thumb|Nagoya map circa 1930\nFile:Toyota Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Toyota]] Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938\nFile:TBCN Kakunai Line.JPG|Nagoya in the [[Showa period]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of [[Bombing of Nagoya in World War II|US air raids]] during [[World War II]].

It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of [[Kakamigahara, Gifu|Kagamigahara]]. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during [[World War II]].\n\nAir raids began on [[April 18, 1942]], with an [[Doolittle Raid|attack]] on a [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant.<ref>''The First Heroes'' by Craig Nelson</ref> The [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II|bombing]]<nowiki/> continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale [[firebombing]].

The city was built on low-level [[plateau]]s to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The [[Kiso River]] flows to the west along the city border, and the [[Sh\u014dnai River]] comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made [[Hori River (Nagoya)|Hori River]] was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\n\nThe city's location and its position in the [[Ch\u016bbu region|centre of Japan]] allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n=== Wards ===\n[[File:Nagoya_City_Hall_2011-10-28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nagoya City Hall]]]]\n\nNagoya has 16 [[Wards of Japan|wards]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Wards of Nagoya\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!Map of Nagoya \n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!Population\n!''Land area in km<sup>2</sup>''\n!Pop. density\nper km2\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya|Atsuta-ku]]\n|\u71b1\u7530\u533a\n|Blue\n|66,318\n|8.20\n|8,088\n| rowspan=\"16\" |[[File:Nagoya_Wards.png|center|border|400px|A map of Nagoya's Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Chikusa-ku, Nagoya|Chikusa-ku]]\n| \u5343\u7a2e\u533a\n|Brown\n|165,863\n|18.18\n|9,123\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Higashi-ku, Nagoya|Higashi-ku]]\n| \u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|82,939\n|7.71\n|10,757\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita-ku]]\n| \u5317\u533a\n|Purple\n|163,555\n|17.53\n|9,330\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Meit\u014d-ku, Nagoya|Meit\u014d-ku]]\n| \u540d\u6771\u533a\n|Dark blue\n|165,287\n|19.45\n|8,498\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Midori-ku, Nagoya|Midori-ku]]\n| \u7dd1\u533a\n|Light red\n|247,475\n|37.91\n|6,528\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Minami-ku, Nagoya|Minami-ku]]\n| \u5357\u533a\n|Orange\n|136,015\n|18.46\n|7,368\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Minato-ku, Nagoya|Minato-ku]]\n| \u6e2f\u533a\n|Intense Green\n|143,913\n|45.64\n|3,153\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Mizuho-ku, Nagoya|Mizuho-ku]]\n|\u745e\u7a42\u533a\n|Dark purple\n|107,622\n|11.22\n|9,592\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[Moriyama-ku, Nagoya|Moriyama-ku]]\n|\u5b88\u5c71\u533a\n|Light green\n|176,298\n|34.01\n|5,184\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 11\n|[[Naka-ku, Nagoya|Naka-ku]] - administrative center\n|\u4e2d\u533a\n|Green\n|90,918\n|9.38\n|9,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 12\n|[[Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya|Nakagawa-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u5ddd\u533a\n|Pink\n|220,782\n|32.02\n|6,895\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 13\n|[[Nakamura-ku, Nagoya|Nakamura-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u6751\u533a\n|Light blue\n|135,134\n|16.30\n|8,290\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 14\n|[[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]]\n|\u897f\u533a\n|Dark orange\n|150,480\n|17.93\n|8,393\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 15\n|[[Sh\u014dwa-ku, Nagoya|Sh\u014dwa-ku]]\n|\u662d\u548c\u533a\n|Yellow\n|110,436\n|10.94\n|10,095\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 16\n|[[Tenpaku-ku]]\n|\u5929\u767d\u533a\n|Cyan\n|164,522\n|21.58\n|7,624\n|}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Meieki_from_Heiwa_Park_Aqua_Tower.jpg|Nagoya City skyline seen from Heiwa Koen Aqua Tower\nFile:Nagoya_(2015-11-03).JPG|Nagoya in 2015\nFile:Nagoya 2017 (34159008173).jpg|Nagoya city night view\nFile:2016 Japan Nagoya 81 (33038233234).jpg|[[Sakae, Nagoya|Downtown of Sakae Town]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters.

Before and during the [[Edo period]] there were two main kilns in the region: [[Seto ware|Seto]] and [[Tokoname ware|Tokoname]]. In Nagoya Castle a type of ''oniwa-yaki'' (literally \"garden ware\") called [[Ofukei ware]] was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own ''oniwa-yaki'', also to have gifts made. In the town itself [[Toyoraku ware]] and [[Sasashima ware]] [[Japanese tea utensils]] were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord [[Tokugawa Yoshinao]] and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the [[Edo period]]. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as [[Hirasawa Kur\u014d]] and [[Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d]], who made their own pieces.\n\nToyoraku ware continued on until the [[Taish\u014d era]] under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\n\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white [[Kawana ware]]. With the advent of industrialisation during the [[Meiji era]] of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old [[Noritake]], also ''Nagoya E-tsuke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8}}) became popular.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214810/http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |archive-date=2018-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nProduction of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as [[INAX]], [[NGK]], and [[NGK Insulators]].\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]\", are a traditional craft from the area.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially [[Tokugawa Muneharu]], the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\n\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the ''[[Shoin-zukuri]]'' architecture of the feudal era. [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated [[national Treasures of Japan]], including some of the oldest scrolls of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamasa.org's Tokugawa Art Museum page |url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/aichi/tokugawa_artmuseum.html}}</ref> The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of [[Noh theatre]]. The [[Nagoya City Museum]] showcases the history of the town.\n\n[[Y\u014dki-s\u014d]] is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of [[Matsuzakaya]].\n\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the [[Nagoya City Art Museum]]. Modern art is displayed at the [[Aichi Arts Center]]. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], a sister museum to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\n\nThe art of [[porcelain]] and ceramics can be seen at the [[Noritake Garden]]. Toyota has two museums in the city, the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] which shows vintage cars, and the [[Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]], which showcases company history, including its start as a [[textile mill]].\n\nThe [[Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum]] has trams and subway cars, as well as the [[Nagoya City Science Museum]]. The [[SCMaglev and Railway Park]] opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.\n\nOther art museums in Aichi prefecture are the [[Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum]] and the [[Toyota Municipal Museum of Art]]. [[Meiji Mura]] is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the [[Mandolin Melodies Museum]].\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[International Design Centre Nagoya]], the [[Japan Spinning Top Museum]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum]].\n\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"[[Cultural Path]]\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n=== Theatres ===\n[[Noh]] theatre and [[Ky\u014dgen]] date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The [[Nagoya Noh Theater]] at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\n\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's ''[[kabuki]]'' grand stages is [[Misono-za]], which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\n\nIn 1912 the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the [[Nagoya harp]] music instrument.\n\nIn 1992, the large, modern [[Aichi Arts Center]] was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for [[performing art]]s, featuring a main hall that can be used for [[opera]] and theatre and a concert hall. The [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] and holidays, other [[festivals in Nagoya]] are unique to the city/region.\n\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the {{Nihongo|''Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri''|\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d|Street Performer's Festival}} in \u014csu.\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe {{nihongo|[[Nagoya dialect]]|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01|Nagoya-ben}} is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called {{Nihongo|Owari dialect|\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01|Owari-ben}}. The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to [[Japanese language#Official status|standard Japanese]] and to the [[Kansai dialect]], differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of [[Japanese handicrafts]] in the city is centuries old.\n* Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from [[Bungo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\n* ''[[Geta (footwear)|Geta]]'' [[Clog (shoe)|clog]] straps: wooden clogs called ''geta'' were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\n* ''Shippo'': the technique for [[enamelware]] called ''shippo'' arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\n* Candles: [[wax]] is taken from a [[wax tree]] and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (''[[washi]]'') over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the [[Candle wick|wick]] tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\n* ''Yuzen'': the art of [[silk]] dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\n* ''Sekku Ningyo'': festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\n* The city also gave its name to a type of ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', the sash that is used to tie a ''[[kimono]]''. The term ''Nagoya obi'' can refer to an older type of ''obi'' used centuries ago. This type was cord-like.<ref name=\"yoshino\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |title=Kimono |author=Yoshino Antiques |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326233826/http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 }}</ref> The current {{Nihongo3||\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|Nagoya obi}} \u2013 or to differentiate from the ''fukuro Nagoya obi'', also called {{Nihongo3||\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi|extra=\"nine-inch nagoya obi\"}} \u2013 is the most-used ''obi'' type today.

Denmark defended the capital with these ships and bastions on both sides of the harbour inlet, [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|''Kastellet'']], [[Trekroner Fort|''Trekroner'']], ''Lynetten'' (which all still exist) as well as ''Quintus'', ''Sixtus'' and ''Strickers''.<ref name=\"part Det danske s\u00f8forsvar at\">[http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/slaget-paa-reden-1801/ part \"Det danske s\u00f8forsvar\" at]</ref> It was the second attempt by the British to scare Denmark, as the British had already entered [[\u00d8resund]] with a navy in August 1800, in order to force Denmark to sign an alliance with Britain. Now Britain would have Denmark's entire navy and merchant fleet, so it would not fall into the hands of the French. The British were not aware that the modern Royal Danish Navy and many merchant ships were well hidden in the [[Roskilde fjord]]{{Citation needed|reason=Cited sources does not mention this|date=March 2018}}, a bluff which was never called by the British.<ref name=\"part Det danske s\u00f8forsvar at\"/>\n\n==Background==\nThe battle was the result of multiple failures of [[diplomacy]] in the latter half of the 18th century. At the beginning of 1801, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s principal advantage over [[France]] was its naval superiority. The Royal Navy searched neutral ships trading with French ports, seizing their cargoes if they were deemed to be trading with France.<ref>Pocock, p. 229</ref> It was in the British interest to guarantee its naval supremacy and all trade advantages that resulted from it. The Russian Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], having been a British ally, arranged a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] comprising [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Prussia]], and [[Russia]], to enforce free trade with France.  The British viewed the League to be very much in the French interest and a serious threat. The League was hostile to the British blockade and, according to the British, its existence threatened the supply of timber and naval stores from Scandinavia.\n\nIn early 1801, the British government assembled a fleet off [[Great Yarmouth]] at [[Yarmouth Roads]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Norfolk Record Office Information Leaflet 20 Key dates in the history of Great Yarmouth|url=https://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/local-history/great-yarmouth-history/key-dates-for-great-yarmouth|website=www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk|publisher=Norfolk County Council, Records Office|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>, with the goal of breaking up the League. The British needed to act before the [[Baltic Sea]] thawed and released the Russian fleet from its bases at [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]] and [[Reval]] (now [[Tallinn]]). If the Russian fleet joined with the Swedish and Danish fleets, the combined fleets would form a formidable force of up to 123 [[ship-of-the-line|ships-of-the-line]]. The British fleet was under the command of [[Admiral Hyde Parker]], with [[Vice Admiral]] [[Horatio Nelson]] as second-in-command.\n\nFrustrated by the delay, Nelson sent a letter to Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]], a friend and a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty.<ref>Pocock, p. 231</ref> This prompted the [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl of St Vincent]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]) to send a private note, which resulted in the fleet sailing from Yarmouth on 12 March.<ref name= \"autogenerated5\">Roger.</ref> Orders were sent to Parker to go to Copenhagen and detach Denmark from the League by 'amicable arrangement or by actual hostilities', to be followed by 'an immediate and vigorous attack' on the Russians at Reval and then Kronstadt.<ref>Pocock, p. 232</ref>  The British fleet reached the [[Skagen|Skaw]] (Danish: ''Skagen'') on 19 March, where they met a British diplomat, [[Nicholas Vansittart]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pocock, p. 233</ref> who told them that the Danes had rejected an ultimatum.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:Nelson Forcing the Passage of the Sound, 30 March 1801, prior to the Battle of Copenhagen RMG BHC0522.tiff|thumb|''Nelson Forcing the Passage of the Sound'', 30 March 1801]]\nAlthough the [[Admiralty]] had instructed Parker to frustrate the League, by force if necessary, he was a naturally cautious person and moved slowly. He wanted to blockade the Baltic despite the danger of the combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from [[Karlskrona]], in Sweden, did not arrive perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast to put themselves as far from the Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAttacking the Danish fleet would have been difficult as Parker's delay in sailing had allowed the Danes to prepare their positions well. Most of the Danish ships were not fitted for sea but were moored along the shore with old ships (hulks), no longer fit for service at sea, but still powerfully armed, as a line of [[Floating battery|floating batteries]] off the eastern coast of the island of [[Amager]], in front of the city in the King's Channel. The northern end of the line terminated at the [[Trekroner Fort|Tre Kroner]] (''Three Crowns'' \u2014 Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, referring to the [[Kalmar Union]]) forts armed with 68 guns (equal to twice the broadside of a  ship-of-the-line). North of the fort, in the entrance to Copenhagen harbour, were two ships-of-the-line, a large frigate, and two brigs, all rigged for sea, and two more hulks. Batteries covered the water between the Danish line and the shore, and further out to sea a large shoal, the Middle Ground, constricted the channel. The British had no reliable charts or pilots, so Captain [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] spent most of the night of 31 March taking soundings in the channel up to the Danish line.

As the foremost ship drew alongside a Danish ship, it would anchor and engage that ship. The remainder of the line would pass outside the engagement until the next British ship drew alongside the next Danish ship, and so on. The frigate {{HMS|Desir\u00e9e|1800|6}}, together with small gun-brigs, would rake the Danish line from the south, and a force of frigates, commanded by Captain [[Edward Riou]] of {{HMS|Amazon|1799|6}}, would attack the northern end of the line.

The British ships anchored by the stern about a [[cable length|cable]] from the line of Danish ships and batteries, which was relatively long range, and the two exchanged broadsides until a ship ceased firing. The British encountered heavy resistance, partly because they had not spotted the low-lying floating batteries, and partly because of the courage with which the Danes fought. The northern Danish ships, which were rigged and manned, did not enter the battle but remained on station as reserve units, even though the wind direction forced Parker's squadron to approach only slowly.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\n[[File:The Battle of Copenhagen 1801 by Christian M\u00f8lsted.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Copenhagen''.

I hastened down the fore ladder to the lower deck and felt really relieved to find someone alive.' Pocock, p. 236</ref>\n\n===Signal to retreat===\nAdmiral Parker could see little of the battle owing to gun smoke, but could see the [[Flag signals|signals]] on the three grounded British ships, with {{HMS|Bellona|1760|3=2}} and {{HMS|Russell|1764|3=2}} flying signals of distress and {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|3=2}} a signal of inability to proceed.<ref>Clarke and McArthur, p. 607</ref> Thinking that Nelson might have fought to a stand-still but might be unable to retreat without orders (the [[Articles of War (Royal Navy)|Articles of War]] demanded that all ranks 'do their utmost' against the enemy in battle), at 1:30pm Parker told his [[flag captain]]:<blockquote>I will make the signal of recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in condition to continue the action, he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be imputed to him.<ref>Pocock, p. 236</ref></blockquote>Nelson ordered that the signal be acknowledged, but not repeated. He turned to his [[flag captain]], [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]], and said \"You know, Foley, I only have one eye \u2014 I have the right to be blind sometimes,\" and then, holding his telescope [[turning a blind eye|to his blind eye]], said \"I really do not see the signal!\"<ref>Pocock, p. 237</ref> Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson's 'close action' signal at his masthead. Of Nelson's captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson's flagship {{HMS|Elephant|1786|6}}, followed Parker's signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the ''Tre Kroner'' fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire that killed him.\n\n===End of the Battle===\n[[File:Christian M\u00f8lsted - Slaget p\u00e5 Rheden.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''The Battle of Copenhagen'' by Christian M\u00f8lsted.

The guns of the dozen southernmost Danish ships had started to fall silent owing to the damage they had sustained, and the fighting moved northward. According to British eyewitness accounts, much of the Danish line had fallen silent by 2 pm.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Clarke and McArthur, p. 608</ref><ref group=note>Some Danish historians{{who|date=April 2014}} contest the timing, stating that the entire Danish-Norwegian line continued to resist until 2:30 pm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}</ref> The cessation of firing left the way open for the British bomb vessels to approach Copenhagen. In addition, the reinforcements of the ships from the shore batteries were causing the latter to become ineffective.\n\n''Nyborg'' tried to leave the line with ''Aggershuus'' in tow, but both sank. The most northerly ship, the frigate ''Hj\u00e6lperen'', successfully withdrew. The Danish commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Olfert Fischer]], moved from ''Dannebrog'' at 11:30 am, when it caught fire, to ''Holsteen''. When ''Indf\u00f8dsretten'', immediately north of ''Holsteen'', struck its colours at about 2:30 pm, he moved on to the ''Tre Kroner'' fortress. There he engaged three of Parker's ships,{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}<!-- A word missing here - one, two or all ? --> which had lost their manoeuvrability after being badly damaged and had drifted within range. ''Indf\u00f8dsretten''  resumed firing after Captain Schrodersee was ferried to it and took command of the ship.<ref group=note>Schrodersee fell during the battle, and the Crown Prince honoured his sacrifice by later erecting a \"broken shipmast\" at the spot where Schrodersee was ordered to take command of ''Indf\u00f8dsretten''.</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of inexperienced crews, several Danish ships fired on British boats sent out to them after their officers had signalled their surrender. Nelson said that he \"must either send on shore and stop this irregular proceeding, or send in our fire ships and burn them\" and went to his cabin to write a note to the Danes. He sent it with a Danish-speaking officer, Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger, under a flag of truce to the Danish-Norwegian regent, [[Crown Prince]] [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederik]], who had been watching the battle from the ramparts of the Citadel.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The note read:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nTo the Brothers of Englishmen, the Danes\nLord Nelson has directions to spare Denmark when she is no longer resisting, but if firing is continued on the part of Denmark, Lord Nelson will be obliged to set on fire the floating batteries he has taken, without having the power of saving the brave Danes who have defended them.</poem>|Nelson|<ref>[http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1801_1814/Englandskrigene_nelsonbr_PO.htm Danish Naval History website \u2013 Nelson's letter of 2 April 1801] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816205044/http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1801_1814/Englandskrigene_nelsonbr_PO.htm |date=16 August 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nSome British and Danish officers{{who|date=April 2014}} thought the offer of a truce a skilful ''[[ruse de guerre]]'', and some historians{{who|date=April 2014}} have suggested that the battle would have been lost if it had not been adopted.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} Many of the British ships, like many of the Danish ships in the battle, could not carry on fighting much longer. Furthermore, neither side had deployed the ships which they both held in reserve, of which the Danish reserve was arguably the larger, and the truce effectually prevented this deployment at a moment where the British fleet was exposed.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} Though the British had lost no ships, most were severely damaged, just like the Danish ships. Three British ships of the line had lost all their manoeuvrability and had at the time of the truce drifted within the range of ''Tre Kroner''{{'}}s heavy guns which, like the other fortresses, had until then been out of range of the British ships.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} All action ceased when Crown Prince Frederick sent his Adjutant General, Hans Lindholm (a Danish member of parliament), asking for the reason for Nelson's letter. He{{who|date=April 2014}}<!-- Frederick or Lindholm? --> was asked to put it in writing, which he did, in English, while making the joke:\n{{quote|If your guns are not better pointed than your pens, then you will make little impression on Copenhagen.|-|<ref>Pocock, pp. 237\u201338</ref>}}\n\nIn reply, Nelson wrote a note:\n{{quote|<poem>Lord Nelson's object in sending the Flag of Truce was humanity; he therefore consents that hostilities shall cease, and that the wounded Danes may be taken on shore. And Lord Nelson will take his prisoners out of the Vessels, and burn and carry off his prizes as he shall see fit.\n\nLord Nelson, with humble duty to His Royal Highness the Prince of Denmark, will consider this the greatest victory he has ever gained, if it may be the cause of a happy reconciliation and union between his own most gracious Sovereign, and His Majesty the King of Denmark.</poem>|Nelson|{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}}}\n\nwhich was sent back to the Crown Prince. He then referred Lindholm to Parker on {{HMS|London|1766|6}}. Following him there at 4 pm,{{clarify|date=April 2014}} a twenty-four-hour ceasefire was agreed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Clarke and McArthur, p. 609</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter fighting had ended, the Danish flagship ''Dannebrog'' exploded at 4:30 pm, killing 250 men. By the end of the afternoon, three more badly-damaged British ships ran aground, including  {{HMS|Elephant|1786|3=2}}. The Danish-Norwegian ships had been partly manned by volunteers, many having little or no naval experience, and as they were not all listed after the battle, it is uncertain what the exact Danish-Norwegian losses were. Estimates vary between 1,135 and 2,215 captured, killed or wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The official report by Olfert Fischer estimated the Danish-Norwegian casualties to be between 1,600 and 1,800 captured, killed or wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} According to the official returns recorded by each British ship, and repeated in dispatches from Nelson and forwarded by Parker to the Admiralty, British casualties were 963 killed and wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOf the Danish ships engaged in the battle, two had sunk, one had exploded, and twelve had been captured. The British could not spare men for manning [[Prize (law)|prizes]] as they feared that further battles were to come. They burned eleven of the captured ships, and only one, ''Holsteen'', was sailed to England with the wounded under surgeon [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]].<ref>Clarke and McArthur, p. 611</ref> ''Holsteen'' was then taken into service with the Royal Navy and renamed {{HMS|Holstein||6}} (later {{HMS|Nassau|1805|6}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Subsequent events===\n[[File:The Battle of Copenhagen, 2 April 1801 RMG BHC0526.tiff|thumb|left|Another view of The Battle of Copenhagen]]\n\nThe next day, Nelson landed in Copenhagen to open negotiations. Colonel Stewart reported that \"the population showed an admixture of admiration, curiosity and displeasure\".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In a two-hour meeting with the Crown Prince (who spoke English),<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> Nelson was able to secure an indefinite armistice. He then tried to convince first Fischer (whom he had known in the [[West Indies]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> and then the Prince, of British protection against the Russians. Negotiations continued by letter and on 8 April Nelson returned in person with a formal agreement.\n\nThe one sticking point out of the seven articles was a sixteen-week armistice to allow action against the Russians.<ref>Pocock, p. 239</ref> At this point Stewart claims that one of the Danes turned to another and said in French that disagreement might lead to a renewal of hostilities. \"Renew hostilities!\" responded Nelson, and turning to his interpreter said \"Tell him that we are ready in a moment; ready to bombard this very night!\" Hurried apologies followed (the British fleet now occupied positions that would allow the bombardment of Copenhagen) and agreement was reached and signed the next day.<ref>Pocock, pp. 239\u2013240</ref> The armistice was reduced to fourteen weeks, but during it Armed Neutrality would be suspended and the British were to have free access to Copenhagen. Danish prisoners were also paroled. In the final hour of negotiations, the Danes found out (but not the British) that Tsar Paul had been assassinated. This made the end of the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] very likely and freed the Danes from the fear of Russian reprisals against them, allowing them to easily come to agreement. The final peace agreement was then signed on 23 October 1801.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOn 12 April, Parker sailed to [[Karlskrona]] and on the British approach, the Swedish fleet returned to the port where Parker attempted to persuade them to also leave the League.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Pocock, p. 241</ref> Parker refused to sail into the eastern Baltic and instead returned to Copenhagen, where he found that news of his lack of vigour had reached London. On 5 May, he was recalled and ordered to hand his command over to Nelson. Nelson sailed eastwards again and, leaving six ships-of-the-line at Karlskrona, he arrived at Reval on 14 May to find that the ice had melted and the Russian fleet had departed for Kronstadt. He also found out that negotiations for ending the Armed Neutrality had started and so withdrew on 17 May.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" /> As a result of the battle, Lord Nelson was created [[Viscount]] Nelson of the Nile.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThis was not to be the end of the Danish-Norwegian conflict with the British.

It could have been hazardous for the Royal Navy to sail into the fjord, which is very narrow]]\n\nThe '''Battle of Copenhagen of 1801''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Slaget p\u00e5 Reden'') was a [[Naval warfare|naval battle]] in which a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet fought a large force of the [[Royal Danish Navy|Dano\u2013Norwegian Navy]] anchored near [[Copenhagen]] on 2 April 1801.\n\nAs the British ships attempted to enter the harbour of the Danish fleet, stationed in the city's inlet, formed a blockade.<!-- I'm at this point; rewrite fullwise, emphasizing events and including unraveling and outcome --> The Danes mainly used older ships not meant to sail in the sea as blockades. Denmark defended the capital with these ships and bastions on both sides of the harbour inlet, [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|''Kastellet'']], [[Trekroner Fort|''Trekroner'']], ''Lynetten'' (which all still exist) as well as ''Quintus'', ''Sixtus'' and ''Strickers''.<ref name=\"part Det danske s\u00f8forsvar at\">[http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/slaget-paa-reden-1801/ part \"Det danske s\u00f8forsvar\" at]</ref> It was the second attempt by the British to scare Denmark, as the British had already entered [[\u00d8resund]] with a navy in August 1800, in order to force Denmark to sign an alliance with Britain. Now Britain would have Denmark's entire navy and merchant fleet, so it would not fall into the hands of the French. The British were not aware that the modern Royal Danish Navy and many merchant ships were well hidden in the [[Roskilde fjord]]{{Citation needed|reason=Cited sources does not mention this|date=March 2018}}, a bluff which was never called by the British.<ref name=\"part Det danske s\u00f8forsvar at\"/>\n\n==Background==\nThe battle was the result of multiple failures of [[diplomacy]] in the latter half of the 18th century. At the beginning of 1801, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s principal advantage over [[France]] was its naval superiority. The Royal Navy searched neutral ships trading with French ports, seizing their cargoes if they were deemed to be trading with France.<ref>Pocock, p. 229</ref> It was in the British interest to guarantee its naval supremacy and all trade advantages that resulted from it. The Russian Tsar [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], having been a British ally, arranged a [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] comprising [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Prussia]], and [[Russia]], to enforce free trade with France.  The British viewed the League to be very much in the French interest and a serious threat. The League was hostile to the British blockade and, according to the British, its existence threatened the supply of timber and naval stores from Scandinavia.\n\nIn early 1801, the British government assembled a fleet off [[Great Yarmouth]] at [[Yarmouth Roads]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Norfolk Record Office Information Leaflet 20 Key dates in the history of Great Yarmouth|url=https://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/local-history/great-yarmouth-history/key-dates-for-great-yarmouth|website=www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk|publisher=Norfolk County Council, Records Office|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>, with the goal of breaking up the League. The British needed to act before the [[Baltic Sea]] thawed and released the Russian fleet from its bases at [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]] and [[Reval]] (now [[Tallinn]]). If the Russian fleet joined with the Swedish and Danish fleets, the combined fleets would form a formidable force of up to 123 [[ship-of-the-line|ships-of-the-line]]. The British fleet was under the command of [[Admiral Hyde Parker]], with [[Vice Admiral]] [[Horatio Nelson]] as second-in-command.\n\nFrustrated by the delay, Nelson sent a letter to Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]], a friend and a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty.<ref>Pocock, p. 231</ref> This prompted the [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl of St Vincent]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]) to send a private note, which resulted in the fleet sailing from Yarmouth on 12 March.<ref name= \"autogenerated5\">Roger.</ref> Orders were sent to Parker to go to Copenhagen and detach Denmark from the League by 'amicable arrangement or by actual hostilities', to be followed by 'an immediate and vigorous attack' on the Russians at Reval and then Kronstadt.<ref>Pocock, p. 232</ref>  The British fleet reached the [[Skagen|Skaw]] (Danish: ''Skagen'') on 19 March, where they met a British diplomat, [[Nicholas Vansittart]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pocock, p. 233</ref> who told them that the Danes had rejected an ultimatum.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:Nelson Forcing the Passage of the Sound, 30 March 1801, prior to the Battle of Copenhagen RMG BHC0522.tiff|thumb|''Nelson Forcing the Passage of the Sound'', 30 March 1801]]\nAlthough the [[Admiralty]] had instructed Parker to frustrate the League, by force if necessary, he was a naturally cautious person and moved slowly. He wanted to blockade the Baltic despite the danger of the combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from [[Karlskrona]], in Sweden, did not arrive perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast to put themselves as far from the Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAttacking the Danish fleet would have been difficult as Parker's delay in sailing had allowed the Danes to prepare their positions well. Most of the Danish ships were not fitted for sea but were moored along the shore with old ships (hulks), no longer fit for service at sea, but still powerfully armed, as a line of [[Floating battery|floating batteries]] off the eastern coast of the island of [[Amager]], in front of the city in the King's Channel. The northern end of the line terminated at the [[Trekroner Fort|Tre Kroner]] (''Three Crowns'' \u2014 Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, referring to the [[Kalmar Union]]) forts armed with 68 guns (equal to twice the broadside of a  ship-of-the-line). North of the fort, in the entrance to Copenhagen harbour, were two ships-of-the-line, a large frigate, and two brigs, all rigged for sea, and two more hulks. Batteries covered the water between the Danish line and the shore, and further out to sea a large shoal, the Middle Ground, constricted the channel. The British had no reliable charts or pilots, so Captain [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] spent most of the night of 31 March taking soundings in the channel up to the Danish line. Even so, the British ships were not able to locate the deepest part of the channel properly and so kept too far to seaward.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Copenhagen (1801).jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of the battle]]\n\n===Preparations===\nParker gave Nelson the twelve [[ships-of-the-line]] with the shallowest drafts, and all the smaller ships in the fleet.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Parker himself stayed to the north-east of the battle with the heavier ships \u2013 whose deeper drafts did not allow them to safely enter the channel \u2013 screening Nelson from possible external interference and moving towards Copenhagen to engage the northern defences.<ref group=note>[[William Bligh]], of ''Bounty'' fame, commanded ''Glatton'', one of Nelson's ships.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}</ref> Nelson transferred his command from the large 98-gun {{HMS|St George|1785|6}} to the shallower 74-gun {{HMS|Elephant|1786|6}} for this reason.\n\nOn 30 March Nelson, and his second-in-command, Rear Admiral [[Thomas Graves (admiral)|Thomas Graves]], accompanied by Captain Domett and the commanding officer of the troops{{who|date=April 2014}}, sailed in the [[Hired armed lugger Lark|hired lugger ''Lark'']] to reconnoitre the Danish defences at Copenhagen.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 3, pp. 65\u201366</ref> They found the defences to be strong and so spent the evening discussing the plan. Fixed batteries had a significant advantage over ship borne cannon owing to their greater stability and larger guns,<ref name= \"autogenerated5\" /> and the Danes could  reinforce their ships during the battle.<ref group=note>Danish reinforcement included the replacement of a captain at one point.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}</ref> On the other hand, their ships were a motley collection, many of them small, and out-gunned if engaged by the whole of Nelson's force.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Copenhagen, April 2nd 1801 RMG F3841.tiff|thumb|Period map of the battle]]\nNelson's plan was for the British ships to approach the weaker, southern end of the Danish defences in a line parallel to the Danish one. As the foremost ship drew alongside a Danish ship, it would anchor and engage that ship. The remainder of the line would pass outside the engagement until the next British ship drew alongside the next Danish ship, and so on. The frigate {{HMS|Desir\u00e9e|1800|6}}, together with small gun-brigs, would rake the Danish line from the south, and a force of frigates, commanded by Captain [[Edward Riou]] of {{HMS|Amazon|1799|6}}, would attack the northern end of the line. Troops would land and assault the ''Tre Kroner'' fortress once the fleet had subdued the Danish line of ships.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Pocock, p. 235</ref> [[Bomb vessel]]s would sit outside the British line and bombard the Danes by firing over it.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> Should the British be unable to subdue the stronger, northern defences, the destruction of the southern ships would be enough to allow the bomb vessels to approach within range of the city and force negotiations to prevent the bombardment of the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Action===\n[[File:The Battle of Copenhagen, 2 April 1801 RMG BHC0528.tiff|thumb|The picture is viewed from the south end of the King's Deep and shows the British fleet flying the blue ensign.

Then {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}} and {{HMS|Bellona|1760|6}} ran aground on the Middle Ground, severely restricting their role in the battle.

The British ships anchored by the stern about a [[cable length|cable]] from the line of Danish ships and batteries, which was relatively long range, and the two exchanged broadsides until a ship ceased firing. The British encountered heavy resistance, partly because they had not spotted the low-lying floating batteries, and partly because of the courage with which the Danes fought. The northern Danish ships, which were rigged and manned, did not enter the battle but remained on station as reserve units, even though the wind direction forced Parker's squadron to approach only slowly.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\n[[File:The Battle of Copenhagen 1801 by Christian M\u00f8lsted.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Copenhagen''.

I hastened down the fore ladder to the lower deck and felt really relieved to find someone alive.' Pocock, p. 236</ref>\n\n===Signal to retreat===\nAdmiral Parker could see little of the battle owing to gun smoke, but could see the [[Flag signals|signals]] on the three grounded British ships, with {{HMS|Bellona|1760|3=2}} and {{HMS|Russell|1764|3=2}} flying signals of distress and {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|3=2}} a signal of inability to proceed.<ref>Clarke and McArthur, p. 607</ref> Thinking that Nelson might have fought to a stand-still but might be unable to retreat without orders (the [[Articles of War (Royal Navy)|Articles of War]] demanded that all ranks 'do their utmost' against the enemy in battle), at 1:30pm Parker told his [[flag captain]]:<blockquote>I will make the signal of recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in condition to continue the action, he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be imputed to him.<ref>Pocock, p. 236</ref></blockquote>Nelson ordered that the signal be acknowledged, but not repeated. He turned to his [[flag captain]], [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]], and said \"You know, Foley, I only have one eye \u2014 I have the right to be blind sometimes,\" and then, holding his telescope [[turning a blind eye|to his blind eye]], said \"I really do not see the signal!\"<ref>Pocock, p. 237</ref> Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson's 'close action' signal at his masthead. Of Nelson's captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson's flagship {{HMS|Elephant|1786|6}}, followed Parker's signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the ''Tre Kroner'' fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire that killed him.\n\n===End of the Battle===\n[[File:Christian M\u00f8lsted - Slaget p\u00e5 Rheden.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''The Battle of Copenhagen'' by Christian M\u00f8lsted.

The guns of the dozen southernmost Danish ships had started to fall silent owing to the damage they had sustained, and the fighting moved northward. According to British eyewitness accounts, much of the Danish line had fallen silent by 2 pm.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Clarke and McArthur, p. 608</ref><ref group=note>Some Danish historians{{who|date=April 2014}} contest the timing, stating that the entire Danish-Norwegian line continued to resist until 2:30 pm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}</ref> The cessation of firing left the way open for the British bomb vessels to approach Copenhagen. In addition, the reinforcements of the ships from the shore batteries were causing the latter to become ineffective.\n\n''Nyborg'' tried to leave the line with ''Aggershuus'' in tow, but both sank. The most northerly ship, the frigate ''Hj\u00e6lperen'', successfully withdrew. The Danish commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Olfert Fischer]], moved from ''Dannebrog'' at 11:30 am, when it caught fire, to ''Holsteen''. When ''Indf\u00f8dsretten'', immediately north of ''Holsteen'', struck its colours at about 2:30 pm, he moved on to the ''Tre Kroner'' fortress. There he engaged three of Parker's ships,{{Clarify|date=May 2009}}<!-- A word missing here - one, two or all ? --> which had lost their manoeuvrability after being badly damaged and had drifted within range. ''Indf\u00f8dsretten''  resumed firing after Captain Schrodersee was ferried to it and took command of the ship.<ref group=note>Schrodersee fell during the battle, and the Crown Prince honoured his sacrifice by later erecting a \"broken shipmast\" at the spot where Schrodersee was ordered to take command of ''Indf\u00f8dsretten''.</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of inexperienced crews, several Danish ships fired on British boats sent out to them after their officers had signalled their surrender. Nelson said that he \"must either send on shore and stop this irregular proceeding, or send in our fire ships and burn them\" and went to his cabin to write a note to the Danes. He sent it with a Danish-speaking officer, Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger, under a flag of truce to the Danish-Norwegian regent, [[Crown Prince]] [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederik]], who had been watching the battle from the ramparts of the Citadel.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The note read:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nTo the Brothers of Englishmen, the Danes\nLord Nelson has directions to spare Denmark when she is no longer resisting, but if firing is continued on the part of Denmark, Lord Nelson will be obliged to set on fire the floating batteries he has taken, without having the power of saving the brave Danes who have defended them.</poem>|Nelson|<ref>[http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1801_1814/Englandskrigene_nelsonbr_PO.htm Danish Naval History website \u2013 Nelson's letter of 2 April 1801] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816205044/http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1801_1814/Englandskrigene_nelsonbr_PO.htm |date=16 August 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nSome British and Danish officers{{who|date=April 2014}} thought the offer of a truce a skilful ''[[ruse de guerre]]'', and some historians{{who|date=April 2014}} have suggested that the battle would have been lost if it had not been adopted.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} Many of the British ships, like many of the Danish ships in the battle, could not carry on fighting much longer. Furthermore, neither side had deployed the ships which they both held in reserve, of which the Danish reserve was arguably the larger, and the truce effectually prevented this deployment at a moment where the British fleet was exposed.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} Though the British had lost no ships, most were severely damaged, just like the Danish ships. Three British ships of the line had lost all their manoeuvrability and had at the time of the truce drifted within the range of ''Tre Kroner''{{'}}s heavy guns which, like the other fortresses, had until then been out of range of the British ships.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=June 2016}} All action ceased when Crown Prince Frederick sent his Adjutant General, Hans Lindholm (a Danish member of parliament), asking for the reason for Nelson's letter. He{{who|date=April 2014}}<!-- Frederick or Lindholm? --> was asked to put it in writing, which he did, in English, while making the joke:\n{{quote|If your guns are not better pointed than your pens, then you will make little impression on Copenhagen.|-|<ref>Pocock, pp. 237\u201338</ref>}}\n\nIn reply, Nelson wrote a note:\n{{quote|<poem>Lord Nelson's object in sending the Flag of Truce was humanity; he therefore consents that hostilities shall cease, and that the wounded Danes may be taken on shore. And Lord Nelson will take his prisoners out of the Vessels, and burn and carry off his prizes as he shall see fit.\n\nLord Nelson, with humble duty to His Royal Highness the Prince of Denmark, will consider this the greatest victory he has ever gained, if it may be the cause of a happy reconciliation and union between his own most gracious Sovereign, and His Majesty the King of Denmark.</poem>|Nelson|{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}}}\n\nwhich was sent back to the Crown Prince. He then referred Lindholm to Parker on {{HMS|London|1766|6}}. Following him there at 4 pm,{{clarify|date=April 2014}} a twenty-four-hour ceasefire was agreed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Clarke and McArthur, p. 609</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter fighting had ended, the Danish flagship ''Dannebrog'' exploded at 4:30 pm, killing 250 men. By the end of the afternoon, three more badly-damaged British ships ran aground, including  {{HMS|Elephant|1786|3=2}}. The Danish-Norwegian ships had been partly manned by volunteers, many having little or no naval experience, and as they were not all listed after the battle, it is uncertain what the exact Danish-Norwegian losses were. Estimates vary between 1,135 and 2,215 captured, killed or wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The official report by Olfert Fischer estimated the Danish-Norwegian casualties to be between 1,600 and 1,800 captured, killed or wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} According to the official returns recorded by each British ship, and repeated in dispatches from Nelson and forwarded by Parker to the Admiralty, British casualties were 963 killed and wounded.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOf the Danish ships engaged in the battle, two had sunk, one had exploded, and twelve had been captured. The British could not spare men for manning [[Prize (law)|prizes]] as they feared that further battles were to come. They burned eleven of the captured ships, and only one, ''Holsteen'', was sailed to England with the wounded under surgeon [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]].<ref>Clarke and McArthur, p. 611</ref> ''Holsteen'' was then taken into service with the Royal Navy and renamed {{HMS|Holstein||6}} (later {{HMS|Nassau|1805|6}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Subsequent events===\n[[File:The Battle of Copenhagen, 2 April 1801 RMG BHC0526.tiff|thumb|left|Another view of The Battle of Copenhagen]]\n\nThe next day, Nelson landed in Copenhagen to open negotiations. Colonel Stewart reported that \"the population showed an admixture of admiration, curiosity and displeasure\".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In a two-hour meeting with the Crown Prince (who spoke English),<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> Nelson was able to secure an indefinite armistice. He then tried to convince first Fischer (whom he had known in the [[West Indies]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> and then the Prince, of British protection against the Russians. Negotiations continued by letter and on 8 April Nelson returned in person with a formal agreement.\n\nThe one sticking point out of the seven articles was a sixteen-week armistice to allow action against the Russians.<ref>Pocock, p. 239</ref> At this point Stewart claims that one of the Danes turned to another and said in French that disagreement might lead to a renewal of hostilities. \"Renew hostilities!\" responded Nelson, and turning to his interpreter said \"Tell him that we are ready in a moment; ready to bombard this very night!\" Hurried apologies followed (the British fleet now occupied positions that would allow the bombardment of Copenhagen) and agreement was reached and signed the next day.<ref>Pocock, pp. 239\u2013240</ref> The armistice was reduced to fourteen weeks, but during it Armed Neutrality would be suspended and the British were to have free access to Copenhagen. Danish prisoners were also paroled. In the final hour of negotiations, the Danes found out (but not the British) that Tsar Paul had been assassinated. This made the end of the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] very likely and freed the Danes from the fear of Russian reprisals against them, allowing them to easily come to agreement. The final peace agreement was then signed on 23 October 1801.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOn 12 April, Parker sailed to [[Karlskrona]] and on the British approach, the Swedish fleet returned to the port where Parker attempted to persuade them to also leave the League.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Pocock, p. 241</ref> Parker refused to sail into the eastern Baltic and instead returned to Copenhagen, where he found that news of his lack of vigour had reached London. On 5 May, he was recalled and ordered to hand his command over to Nelson. Nelson sailed eastwards again and, leaving six ships-of-the-line at Karlskrona, he arrived at Reval on 14 May to find that the ice had melted and the Russian fleet had departed for Kronstadt. He also found out that negotiations for ending the Armed Neutrality had started and so withdrew on 17 May.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" /> As a result of the battle, Lord Nelson was created [[Viscount]] Nelson of the Nile.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThis was not to be the end of the Danish-Norwegian conflict with the British. In 1807, similar circumstances led to another British attack, in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]].\n\n==Ships involved==\n<!-- Assume numbers to be crew, remove 'Captain' from the first and include Captain column in a table created for this mess -->\n===United Kingdom===\n;Nelson's squadron\n* [[HMS Polyphemus (1782)|''Polyphemus'']] 64 (Captain [[John Lawford]])\n* [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] 50 (Captain [[James Walker (Royal Navy officer)|James Walker]])\n* [[HMS Edgar (1779)|''Edgar'']] 74 (Captain [[George Murray (Royal Navy officer)|George Murray]])\n* [[HMS Ardent (1796)|''Ardent'']] 64 (Captain [[Thomas Bertie]])\n* [[HMS Glatton (1795)|''Glatton'']] 54/56 (Captain [[William Bligh]])\n* [[HMS Elephant (1786)|''Elephant'']] 74 (flag of Vice-Adm.

It was founded in 1922 by Ernest Bevin and James Flowers with Bevin serving as its first [[general secretary]].\n\nIn 2007, it merged with [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] to form [[Unite the Union]].\n\n==History==\nAt the time of its creation in 1922, the TGWU was the largest and most ambitious amalgamation brought about within trade unionism. Its structure combined regional organisation, based on Districts and Areas, with committee organisation by occupation, based on six broad Trade Groups. Trade groups were not closely linked to trades, but were elected by activists. Officials of the union were grouped by region, and could be asked to serve each or any trade group.\n\n===Docks Group===\nThe Docks Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union|Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[South Side Labour Protection League|Labour Protection League]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Coal Porters' Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]] (Cardiff, est. 1889)\n*[[North of England Trimmers' and Teemers' Association]] (est. 1871)\n\nThe group originally had a subsection for coal shipping.<ref name=\"eaton\">{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Jack|last2=Gill|first2=Colin|title=The Trade Union Directory|date=1981|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0861043502|pages=54-68}}</ref>  In 1928, it had 96,000 members, but over time, membership of the group declined along with employment on the docks, dropping to 56,000 in 1966, and had 51,153 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last1=Hyman |first1=Richard |title=The Workers' Union |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Waterways Group===\nThe Waterways Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the [[Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen]].

From the 1960s it was generally known as ACTS (Administrative, Clerical, Technical and Supervisory) but also sometimes as the ACTSS (Association of Clerical, Technical and Supervisory Staff) and enamel union badges bearing both sets of initials were produced for members.

These decisions were made at the Biennial Delegate Conference, and although there were many applications to form new trade groups, most were unsuccessful.

Some of these unions retained a great deal of autonomy and in many ways effectively functioned as separate unions, even being registered separately with the [[Registrar of Friendly Societies]].

On 14 June 2006 the GMB Conference voted not to continue with discussions although the other two unions are proceeding, with delegates approving the proposed 'Instrument of Amalgamation' at a special conference on 18 December 2006.  The ballot of both unions' membership during February and early March 2007, also approved the merger.  The result of the ballot was announced on 8 March 2007: 86.4 per cent of T&G members and 70.1 per cent of Amicus members voted to support the merger, from a turnout of 27%.  The press release announced that the resulting union had the working title \"New Union\" and the name would be decided by a ballot of the membership.<ref>{{cite web

It was founded in 1922 by Ernest Bevin and [[James Flowers]] with Bevin serving as its first [[general secretary]].\n\nIn 2007, it merged with [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] to form [[Unite the Union]].\n\n==History==\nAt the time of its creation in 1922, the TGWU was the largest and most ambitious amalgamation brought about within trade unionism. Its structure combined regional organisation, based on Districts and Areas, with committee organisation by occupation, based on six broad Trade Groups. Trade groups were not closely linked to trades, but were elected by activists. Officials of the union were grouped by region, and could be asked to serve each or any trade group.\n\n===Docks Group===\nThe Docks Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union|Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[South Side Labour Protection League|Labour Protection League]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Coal Porters' Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]] (Cardiff, est. 1889)\n*[[North of England Trimmers' and Teemers' Association]] (est. 1871)\n\nThe group originally had a subsection for coal shipping.<ref name=\"eaton\">{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Jack|last2=Gill|first2=Colin|title=The Trade Union Directory|date=1981|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0861043502|pages=54-68}}</ref>  In 1928, it had 96,000 members, but over time, membership of the group declined along with employment on the docks, dropping to 56,000 in 1966, and had 51,153 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last1=Hyman |first1=Richard |title=The Workers' Union |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Waterways Group===\nThe Waterways Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the [[Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen]].

This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name=\"CollisPage 149\">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>\n\nHis lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"<ref name=\"CollisPage12\">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>\n\nMorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: \"I write from a different place.
