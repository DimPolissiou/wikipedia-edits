There are four tracks and three [[island platform]]s with the outer two in revenue service.\n\nSouth of the station, trains can either continue on Eighth Avenue or diverge east to the [[Seventh Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Seventh Avenue]] station via the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]. North of the station are [[crossover (rail)|crossover]]s in both directions, and the northbound tracks cross over the southbound tracks to form a two-level configuration to [[103rd Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|103rd Street]]. The next express station to the north, [[125th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|125th Street]], is 3.35 miles (5.391&nbsp;km) away with seven local stations in between. This is the longest distance between two express stops in the system.\n\nAt the middle of each open platform, there are two staircases and one elevator that connect with the northbound platform of [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]]. There is also one staircase from each platform at the north end leading to the same area. A single staircase at the extreme south end connects to the southbound IRT platform. There are two newsstands, one each at the center of both platforms.\n\nThis station formerly had a 1992 artwork called ''Hello Columbus'', made by various [[New York City]] artists and public school students. [[Sol LeWitt]] created tile work on the stairway from the IND platforms to the uptown IRT platform entitled ''Whirls and Twirls'', installed in 2009.<ref name=\"MTA-ReviewAC-2015\" /> Large white \"59\"s are placed over the blue stripes\u2013similar to the \"42\"s at [[42nd Street\u2013Port Authority Bus Terminal (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|42nd Street\u2013Port Authority]].\n\n===History===\n[[File:59th Street - Columbus Circle Middle Platform.JPG|thumb|left|Passageway between the two IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line platforms via the center IND platform.]]\n[[File:59 Street 2008 vc.jpg|thumb|left|The unused center platform during renovation]]\n\nWhen the IND Eighth Avenue Line was being built, the station was originally planned to be located at 57th Street, with entrances extending up to 61st Street. This station, along with the IRT station, was designed as a major transit hub under Columbus Circle.<ref>{{cite web | title=PLAN HUGE CENTRE OF SUBWAY TRAFFIC; Transit Lines Will Build Dual Station at Columbus Circle Four Blocks in Length. 16 ENTRANCES PROPOSED Growth of Section From 1905 to 1926 Is Indicated by Rise of 7,167,592 Fares. | website=The New York Times | date=April 24, 1927 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/04/24/archives/plan-huge-centre-of-subway-traffic-transit-lines-will-build-dual.html | access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> The station opened on September 8, 1932, along of majority of the Eighth Avenue Line from [[Chambers Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] north to [[Inwood\u2013207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|207th Street]].<ref name=\"Chambers\"/>\n\nThe center platform was originally built along with the other platforms, but was first used in passenger service in 1959. It served the purpose of a [[Spanish solution]], allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides. Newer subway cars' door controls made it more difficult to open doors on both sides of the train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007\u20132010, it was converted to a crossunder between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected to keep people away from the edges.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Nearby points of interest==\n*[[Church of St. Paul the Apostle (New York City)|Church of St. Paul the Apostle]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Museum of Arts &amp; Design]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[New York Institute of Technology]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Professional Children's School]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Fordham University]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book | last=Stookey | first=Lee | title=Subway ceramics : a history and iconography of mosaic and bas relief signs and plaques in the New York City subway system | publisher=L.

The circular staircase was expected to be reconstructed to provide more direct access The 61st Street exit was operated part-time, closing at nights, consisted of a high exit turnstile and was used by 2400 daily passengers. It was located in a remote unmonitored portion of the station, making safety an added consideration for its closure.

There are four tracks and three [[island platform]]s with the outer two in revenue service.\n\nSouth of the station, trains can either continue on Eighth Avenue or diverge east to the [[Seventh Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Seventh Avenue]] station via the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]]. North of the station are [[crossover (rail)|crossover]]s in both directions, and the northbound tracks cross over the southbound tracks to form a two-level configuration to [[103rd Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|103rd Street]]. The next express station to the north, [[125th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|125th Street]], is 3.35 miles (5.391&nbsp;km) away with seven local stations in between. This is the longest distance between two express stops in the system.\n\nAt the middle of each open platform, there are two staircases and one elevator that connect with the northbound platform of [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]]. There is also one staircase from each platform at the north end leading to the same area. A single staircase at the extreme south end connects to the southbound IRT platform. There are two newsstands, one each at the center of both platforms.\n\nThis station formerly had a 1992 artwork called ''Hello Columbus'', made by various [[New York City]] artists and public school students. [[Sol LeWitt]] created tile work on the stairway from the IND platforms to the uptown IRT platform entitled ''Whirls and Twirls'', installed in 2009.<ref name=\"MTA-ReviewAC-2015\" /> Large white \"59\"s are placed over the blue stripes\u2013similar to the \"42\"s at [[42nd Street\u2013Port Authority Bus Terminal (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|42nd Street\u2013Port Authority]].\n\n===History===\n[[File:59th Street - Columbus Circle Middle Platform.JPG|thumb|left|Passageway between the two IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line platforms via the center IND platform.]]\n[[File:59 Street 2008 vc.jpg|thumb|left|The unused center platform during renovation]]\n\nWhen the IND Eighth Avenue Line was being built, the station was originally planned to be located at 57th Street, with entrances extending up to 61st Street. This station, along with the IRT station, was designed as a major transit hub under Columbus Circle.<ref>{{cite web | title=PLAN HUGE CENTRE OF SUBWAY TRAFFIC; Transit Lines Will Build Dual Station at Columbus Circle Four Blocks in Length. 16 ENTRANCES PROPOSED Growth of Section From 1905 to 1926 Is Indicated by Rise of 7,167,592 Fares. | website=The New York Times | date=April 24, 1927 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/04/24/archives/plan-huge-centre-of-subway-traffic-transit-lines-will-build-dual.html | access-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> The station opened on September 8, 1932, along of majority of the Eighth Avenue Line from [[Chambers Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] north to [[Inwood\u2013207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|207th Street]].<ref name=\"Chambers\"/>\n\nThe center platform was originally built along with the other platforms, but was first used in passenger service in 1959. It served the purpose of a [[Spanish solution]], allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides. Newer subway cars' door controls made it more difficult to open doors on both sides of the train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007\u20132010, it was converted to a crossunder between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected to keep people away from the edges.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Nearby points of interest==\n*[[Church of St. Paul the Apostle (New York City)|Church of St. Paul the Apostle]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Museum of Arts &amp; Design]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[New York Institute of Technology]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Professional Children's School]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n*[[Fordham University]]<ref name=MTAMaps-2015/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book | last=Stookey | first=Lee | title=Subway ceramics : a history and iconography of mosaic and bas relief signs and plaques in the New York City subway system | publisher=L.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skene|first=Norman L.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8TFHPwbgNgC&printsec=frontcover|title=Elements of Yacht Design|date=2001|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-134-2|language=en}}</ref> In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[File:Destination 644.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht, ''Destination'', with roller furled jibs and mainsail in 2014]]\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n=== Styling ===\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's ''sheer line'' (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the ''bow'' (convex curve), ''destroyer'' or ''vertical'' (near vertical), and ''knuckle'' or ''raked'' (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include ''raked aft'' or ''counter'' (slight outward angle), ''straight'' (up and down),  ''reverse angle'' (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Killing|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GliCdk2exrgC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PT58&dq=racing+yacht+design|title=Yacht Design Explained: A Sailor's Guide to the Principles and Practice of Design|last2=Hunter|first2=Douglas|date=1998|publisher=W.

High-performance rigs and hulls receive the bulk of the investment to achieve this. Underwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast.<ref name=\":8\" /> On some racing yachts, a [[canting keel]] shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideway tilt), while other underwater foils take care of [[leeway]] (sideways motion).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Slooff|first=J.

A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of [[jib]] and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and [[trysail]] (in place of the [[mainsail]]).

Except for the [[.244 H&H Magnum]] and [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]], it is the smallest caliber factory cartridge derived from the {{convert|2.85|in|mm|abbr=on}} Holland & Holland belted magnum case. It was introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the [[.338 Winchester Magnum]] and the [[.458 Winchester Magnum]] as one of a family of short-cased {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[belted magnum]] cartridges developed by [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] based on the [[.375 Holland & Holland]] parent case. It was officially introduced to the public by [[Winchester Repeating Arms|Winchester]] in 1959. After many years of dwindling use it began enjoying a mild resurgence in popularity in the mid-2000s among long range rifle enthusiasts and reloaders due to the high ballistic coefficient of the heavier 6.5mm bullets and increasing popularity of cartridges such as [[6.5mm Creedmoor]], [[.260 Remington]], [[6.5 Grendel]], benchrest and [[wildcat cartridge]]s in 6.5mm.\n\n==Design & specifications==\nWinchester had been manufacturing the shortened Holland & Holland cases under a contract for [[Weatherby]] for use in their [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]], [[.270 Weatherby Magnum]] and [[7mm Weatherby Magnum]] cartridges. The Weatherby cases had been based on Winchester's [[.300 H&H Magnum|.30 Super]] cartridge. This new series of shortened Holland & Holland cases was based on the [[.375 Holland & Holland]] case. The advantages of the shortened case were twofold: the cartridge could function through the standard length rifle action as used by the popular [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[.270 Winchester]]. It was also close to the efficiency limitations of powders available at the time given the case capacity of the cartridge. The longer, full length .375 H&H case would not have resulted in a great performance improvement due the powders available at that time. It was similar to the reasoning behind the shortened cases used by Weatherby as DuPont's IMR 4350 was the slowest burning powder available then.\n\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum is a cartridge which was standardized by SAAMI, which published recommended specifications for the cartridge. SAAMI recommends a six groove barrel with a rate of twist of one revolution in {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}}, a bore diameter of {{convert|.256|in|mm|abbr=on}} and a groove diameter of {{convert|.264|in|mm|abbr=on}} with each groove having a width of {{convert|0.090|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The recommended maximum pressure for the cartridge (piezo) is {{convert|64000|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Performance==\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum gained a reputation as a very flat shooting cartridge. When introduced, it was first chambered in the Winchester Model 70 Westerner rifle, which was intended for longer range shooting more common in the Western United States.\n\nAt present Remington, Winchester, HSM, and DoubleTap Ammunition produce ammunition for this cartridge. Manufacturers offer a {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on}} bullet at {{convert|3030|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This ammunition has a [[Point-blank range|maximum point blank range]] of {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} when sighted in at {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Some ammunition offers premium {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on}} Nosler Partition and {{convert|125|gr|g|abbr=on}} Accubond bullets driven at {{convert|3100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3250|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} through a {{convert|24|inch|mm|adj=on}} barrel.\n\nWhile readily available factory ammunition for the cartridge is for the most part fairly basic, handloaders can gain a step up in performance with bullets with better ballistic coefficients and weights to extend the performance of the cartridge. For this reason, this cartridge is better suited for shooters who are willing to make their own ammunition rather than those who purchase over the counter ammunition.\n\n==Reception==\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum main competition comes from the various 7mm cartridges such as the [[7mm Remington Magnum]], [[7mm Weatherby Magnum]], the [[.270 Winchester Short Magnum]], [[.270 Weatherby Magnum]], [[6.5mm Remington Magnum]] and the [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]] cartridges in North America and the cartridges such as the [[6.5\u00d768mm]] in Europe. Due to the over crowded nature of the market in which the cartridge competes, popularity has been on the wane. In particular, the 7mm Remington Magnum release in 1962 led to the cartridge's poor reception by the shooting public. The 7mm Remington Magnum shoots almost as flat as the .264 Winchester Magnum but launches a larger diameter, heavier bullet generating more energy than the .264 Winchester Magnum. Furthermore, the 7mm Remington Magnum benefits from a vast range of compatible bullets due in large part to the popularity of the 7mm caliber while the .264 was something of an oddity and a rather new caliber in North America.\n\nBallistically it is almost identical to the 6.5\u00d768mm (also known incorrectly as the 6.5\u00d768 RWS, 6.5\u00d768 Sch\u00fcler or the 6.5\u00d768 Express Vom Hofe) and the [[9.3\u00d764mm_Brenneke#The 9.3\u00d764mm Brenneke as parent case|6.5\u00d763 Messner Magnum]].\n\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum is an excellent, potentially accurate, very flat-shooting cartridge capable of taking any game in the lower 48 US states, and one of the most powerful of all {{convert|.264|in|mm|abbr=on}} cartridges. When loaded with {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on|lk=in}} bullets at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|3,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} it is an adequate round for deer out to beyond {{convert|500|yd|m}} provided that the hunter is capable of such longer shots.\n\n==Background==\nThe .264 Win. Mag., like many magnum rounds, can wear out barrel throats more rapidly than lower pressure and lower velocity non-magnum cartridges, especially when fired rapidly, which heats up the steel and hastens throat erosion. Throat erosion is greater in higher [[chamber pressure]] [[overbore]] cartridges.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Edward A. Matunas; Ed Matunas\n| title = Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair\n| publisher = Woods N Water Inc\n| location = \n| year = 2003\n| pages = \n| isbn = 0-9722804-2-1\n| oclc = \n| doi = \n| accessdate = \n}}\n</ref> This was particularly true in the 1950s to early 1960s, with the [[chrome moly]] steels almost universally used for barrels then. But recent advances with stainless steel barrels, especially with [[cryogenic treatment]], have extended barrel life considerably with the .264 Win. Mag. and many other cartridges.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nWhile very few production line riflemakers currently offer the .264 Win.

More likely is the fact that hunters had more confidence in the game-getting ability of heavier 7&nbsp;mm (.284\") 150 to 175 grain spitzer-shaped projectiles on big game, as compared to 140 grains being the upper end of pointed .264 bullets.\n\nConversely, Winchester marketed the .264 as a long range, combination varmint and deer round, although suited for harvesting elk or moose. Unfortunately, the recoil it generates, plus the expense of the sheer quantity of ammo that may be used to shoot pests at long range (compared to pure varmint cartridges like the .222 Remington and the .220 Swift, or the smaller varmint / deer rounds, like the .243 Winchester) inhibited its popularity further. The result was more sportsmen opting for the bigger Remington 7&nbsp;mm round because it was seen as more effective on a wider variety of big game; rather than a compromise round  that could be used for varmints, worked well on whitetail and mule deer, but was borderline for the largest North American big game when the need arose.\n\nIn Europe, two of the .264 Win. Mag.'s champions were George Swenson of John Wilkes gunmakers, London, and [[David Lloyd (riflemaker and sportsman)|David Lloyd]] of Northampton, England.  Lloyd built a number of his deluxe [[Lloyd rifle]]s in .264 Win Mag, mainly for sportsmen seeking a cartridge that would give high velocity performance with bullets heavier than the 100 grains fired by the [[.244 H&H Magnum]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rifle cartridges]]\n* [[6 mm caliber]]\n* [[7 mm caliber]]\n\n==References==\n<div class=\"small\">\n{{reflist|2}}\n* [http://www.chuckhawks.com/subscribers/rifle_cartridge_page/264mag.htm The Westerner: .264 Winchester Magnum by Chuck Hawks]\n* [http://www.chuckhawks.com/264mag.htm The .264 Winchester Magnum by Chuck Hawks]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928231350/http://www.gunnersden.com/index.htm.264winchester-magnum.html Gunners' Den]\n<div>\n\n{{Winchester Cartridges Firearms}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:264 Winchester Magnum}}\n[[Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges]]\n[[Category:Winchester Magnum rifle cartridges]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox firearm cartridge\n| name = .264 Winchester Magnum\n| image = 264WinMag.JPG\n| caption = .264 Winchester Magnum\n| origin = United States\n| type = Rifle\n<!-- Service history -->\n| service = \n| used_by = \n| wars = \n<!-- Production history -->\n| designer = [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]]\n| design_date = 1959\n| manufacturer = Winchester\n| production_date = \n| number = \n| variants = \n<!-- Specifications -->\n| is_SI_specs = \n| parent = \n| case type = Rimless, bottleneck\n| bullet = .264\n| neck = .299\n| shoulder = .491\n| base = .515\n| rim_dia = .532\n| rim_thick = \n| case_length = 2.5\n| length = 3.34\n| case_capacity = \n| rifling = 1:9\n| primer = Large rifle\n| max_pressure = 64000\n| max_cup = \n<!-- Ballistic performance -->\n| is_SI_ballistics = \n| bw1 = 100\n| btype1 = Nosler Ballistic Tip\n| vel1 = 3510\n| en1 = 2735\n| bw2 = 125\n| btype2 = Nosler Partition\n| vel2 = 3180\n| en2 = 2806\n| bw3 = 140\n| btype3 = BTSP\n| vel3 = 3200\n| en3 = 3183\n| bw4 = \n| btype4 = \n| vel4 = \n| en4 = \n| bw5 = \n| btype5 = \n| vel5 = \n| en5 = \n| test_barrel_length = \n| balsrc = 26\" test barrel, Terminal Ballistics Research <ref>[http://www.ballisticstudies.com/Knowledgebase/.264+Winchester+Magnum.html Terminal Ballistics Research]</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''.264 Winchester Magnum''' is a belted, bottlenecked rifle [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. Except for the [[.244 H&H Magnum]] and [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]], it is the smallest caliber factory cartridge derived from the {{convert|2.85|in|mm|abbr=on}} Holland & Holland belted magnum case. It was introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the [[.338 Winchester Magnum]] and the [[.458 Winchester Magnum]] as one of a family of short-cased {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[belted magnum]] cartridges developed by [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] based on the [[.375 Holland & Holland]] parent case. It was officially introduced to the public by [[Winchester Repeating Arms|Winchester]] in 1959. After many years of dwindling use it began enjoying a mild resurgence in popularity in the mid-2000s among long range rifle enthusiasts and reloaders due to the high ballistic coefficient of the heavier 6.5mm bullets and increasing popularity of cartridges such as [[6.5mm Creedmoor]], [[.260 Remington]], [[6.5 Grendel]], benchrest and [[wildcat cartridge]]s in 6.5mm.\n\n==Design & specifications==\nWinchester had been manufacturing the shortened Holland & Holland cases under a contract for [[Weatherby]] for use in their [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]], [[.270 Weatherby Magnum]] and [[7mm Weatherby Magnum]] cartridges. The Weatherby cases had been based on Winchester's [[.300 H&H Magnum|.30 Super]] cartridge. This new series of shortened Holland & Holland cases was based on the [[.375 Holland & Holland]] case. The advantages of the shortened case were twofold: the cartridge could function through the standard length rifle action as used by the popular [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[.270 Winchester]]. It was also close to the efficiency limitations of powders available at the time given the case capacity of the cartridge. The longer, full length .375 H&H case would not have resulted in a great performance improvement due the powders available at that time. It was similar to the reasoning behind the shortened cases used by Weatherby as DuPont's IMR 4350 was the slowest burning powder available then.\n\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum is a cartridge which was standardized by SAAMI, which published recommended specifications for the cartridge. SAAMI recommends a six groove barrel with a rate of twist of one revolution in {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}}, a bore diameter of {{convert|.256|in|mm|abbr=on}} and a groove diameter of {{convert|.264|in|mm|abbr=on}} with each groove having a width of {{convert|0.090|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The recommended maximum pressure for the cartridge (piezo) is {{convert|64000|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Performance==\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum gained a reputation as a very flat shooting cartridge. When introduced, it was first chambered in the Winchester Model 70 Westerner rifle, which was intended for longer range shooting more common in the Western United States.\n\nAt present Remington, Winchester, HSM, and DoubleTap Ammunition produce ammunition for this cartridge. Manufacturers offer a {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on}} bullet at {{convert|3030|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This ammunition has a [[Point-blank range|maximum point blank range]] of {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} when sighted in at {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Some ammunition offers premium {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on}} Nosler Partition and {{convert|125|gr|g|abbr=on}} Accubond bullets driven at {{convert|3100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3250|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} through a {{convert|24|inch|mm|adj=on}} barrel.\n\nWhile readily available factory ammunition for the cartridge is for the most part fairly basic, handloaders can gain a step up in performance with bullets with better ballistic coefficients and weights to extend the performance of the cartridge. For this reason, this cartridge is better suited for shooters who are willing to make their own ammunition rather than those who purchase over the counter ammunition.\n\n==Reception==\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum main competition comes from the various 7mm cartridges such as the [[7mm Remington Magnum]], [[7mm Weatherby Magnum]], the [[.270 Winchester Short Magnum]], [[.270 Weatherby Magnum]], [[6.5mm Remington Magnum]] and the [[.257 Weatherby Magnum]] cartridges in North America and the cartridges such as the [[6.5\u00d768mm]] in Europe. Due to the over crowded nature of the market in which the cartridge competes, popularity has been on the wane. In particular, the 7mm Remington Magnum release in 1962 led to the cartridge's poor reception by the shooting public. The 7mm Remington Magnum shoots almost as flat as the .264 Winchester Magnum but launches a larger diameter, heavier bullet generating more energy than the .264 Winchester Magnum. Furthermore, the 7mm Remington Magnum benefits from a vast range of compatible bullets due in large part to the popularity of the 7mm caliber while the .264 was something of an oddity and a rather new caliber in North America.\n\nBallistically it is almost identical to the 6.5\u00d768mm (also known incorrectly as the 6.5\u00d768 RWS, 6.5\u00d768 Sch\u00fcler or the 6.5\u00d768 Express Vom Hofe) and the [[9.3\u00d764mm_Brenneke#The 9.3\u00d764mm Brenneke as parent case|6.5\u00d763 Messner Magnum]].\n\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum is an excellent, potentially accurate, very flat-shooting cartridge capable of taking any game in the lower 48 US states, and one of the most powerful of all {{convert|.264|in|mm|abbr=on}} cartridges. When loaded with {{convert|140|gr|g|abbr=on|lk=in}} bullets at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|3,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} it is an adequate round for deer out to beyond {{convert|500|yd|m}} provided that the hunter is capable of such longer shots.\n\n==Background==\nThe .264 Win. Mag., like many magnum rounds, can wear out barrel throats more rapidly than lower pressure and lower velocity non-magnum cartridges, especially when fired rapidly, which heats up the steel and hastens throat erosion. Throat erosion is greater in higher [[chamber pressure]] [[overbore]] cartridges.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Edward A. Matunas; Ed Matunas\n| title = Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair\n| publisher = Woods N Water Inc\n| location = \n| year = 2003\n| pages = \n| isbn = 0-9722804-2-1\n| oclc = \n| doi = \n| accessdate = \n}}\n</ref> This was particularly true in the 1950s to early 1960s, with the [[chrome moly]] steels almost universally used for barrels then.

He was quite politically devout, eventually joining in the CCP's Youth League. At the age of eleven, he was chosen by [[Madame Mao]]'s cultural advisors to attend the [[Beijing Dance Academy]], where students had to undergo 16-hour-a-day training. He attended the Academy for seven years. The regime in Beijing Dance was harsh, starting each morning at 5:30. Li performed well in the politics class,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mao's Last Dancer|author=Li Cunxin|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_b_697605|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> but did badly in ballet.

He was held in the Chinese Consulate in Houston, his defection creating headlines in America. He had begun a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey, and in 1981, they married so that Li could avoid deportation.

He often had to support his extremely poor family. Li's early life coincided with Mao Zedong's rule over the new Communist nation. Li had a strong desire to serve China's Communist Party. He was quite politically devout, eventually joining in the CCP's Youth League. At the age of eleven, he was chosen by [[Madame Mao]]'s cultural advisors to attend the [[Beijing Dance Academy]], where students had to undergo 16-hour-a-day training. He attended the Academy for seven years. The regime in Beijing Dance was harsh, starting each morning at 5:30. Li performed well in the politics class,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mao's Last Dancer|author=Li Cunxin|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/post_b_697605|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> but did badly in ballet.

He was held in the Chinese Consulate in Houston, his defection creating headlines in America. He had begun a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey, and in 1981, they married so that Li could avoid deportation. After 21 hours of negotiations, and intervention by George Bush Sr. (U.S. Vice President at the time), Li was allowed to stay in the US as a free man, but his Chinese citizenship was revoked.<ref name=\"LCH\"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Taylor, Christie|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0514/p15s01-almo.html|title='Mao's last dancer' tells his story|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=14 May 2004|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nLi subsequently danced with the Houston Ballet for sixteen years, during which he won two silver and a bronze medal at International Ballet Competitions.

The only way for Bradford, \u00a313 million into debt, to move forward was to going into administration to try and save the club and find a buyer. Cuts had to be made, the most drastic being the cancelling of the contracts of sixteen members of the professional squad, leaving manager Nicky Law with five professionals with a handful of senior appearances among them and sixteen scholars.\n\nAfter a summer of uncertainty, on 1 August the administrators managed to get creditors to accept a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, which would reschedule debts and reinstate the players, who had gone unpaid since April. One player not to return was Benito Carbone, who sacrificed a large chunk of the money owed to him on his contract and moved back to Italy. Chairman Richmond resigned from the board of directors on 10 August, after a reign of eight years. He was replaced as chairman by theme park magnate and new co-owner [[Gordon Gibb]], who, along with [[Julian Rhodes]], had completed a take-over of the club at the 11th hour before Bradford were due to lose their Football League status.<ref>http://origin-www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10266~91553,00.html{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, agreement was finally reached with the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] over payment owed to the players. With agreement having already been made with the creditors, this now allowed the Football League to return Bradford City's share in the League, effectively bringing the club out of administration.\n\nWith a transfer embargo in place, manager Nicky Law had to show an eye for a bargain and unearthed some raw talent. Youngsters [[Danny Forrest]] and [[Simon Francis (footballer)|Simon Francis]] emerged while Law worked the loan system to cope with an horrific list of injuries.\n\nBradford eventually finished the season in 19th place; given all that had happened off the field, this was to be considered a success.<ref>http://origin-www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10266~264594,00.html{{Dead

Division]].\n\n==Season summary==\nJust after the end of the previous season, Bradford had been placed into administration, as a result of the collapse of [[ITV Digital]], \"six weeks of madness\" in the transfer market in 2000 and the collapse of the sale of [[Benito Carbone]] (on weekly wages of \u00a340,000) to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. The only way for Bradford, \u00a313 million into debt, to move forward was to going into administration to try and save the club and find a buyer. Cuts had to be made, the most drastic being the cancelling of the contracts of sixteen members of the professional squad, leaving manager Nicky Law with five professionals with a handful of senior appearances among them and sixteen scholars.\n\nAfter a summer of uncertainty, on 1 August the administrators managed to get creditors to accept a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, which would reschedule debts and reinstate the players, who had gone unpaid since April. One player not to return was Benito Carbone, who sacrificed a large chunk of the money owed to him on his contract and moved back to Italy. Chairman Richmond resigned from the board of directors on 10 August, after a reign of eight years. He was replaced as chairman by theme park magnate and new co-owner [[Gordon Gibb]], who, along with [[Julian Rhodes]], had completed a take-over of the club at the 11th hour before Bradford were due to lose their Football League status.<ref>http://origin-www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10266~91553,00.html{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, agreement was finally reached with the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] over payment owed to the players. With agreement having already been made with the creditors, this now allowed the Football League to return Bradford City's share in the League, effectively bringing the club out of administration.\n\nWith a transfer embargo in place, manager Nicky Law had to show an eye for a bargain and unearthed some raw talent. Youngsters [[Danny Forrest]] and [[Simon Francis (footballer)|Simon Francis]] emerged while Law worked the loan system to cope with an horrific list of injuries.\n\nBradford eventually finished the season in 19th place; given all that had happened off the field, this was to be considered a success.<ref>http://origin-www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10266~264594,00.html{{Dead

It diffuses the jet of air, so that the hair is not blown around while it dries. The hair dries more slowly, at a cooler temperature, and with less physical disturbance. This makes it so that the hair is less likely to frizz and it gives the hair more volume.\n* An airflow concentrator does the opposite of a diffuser. It makes the end of the blow dryer narrower and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot to make it dry rapidly.\n* The comb nozzle attachment is the same as the airflow concentrator, but it ends with comb-like teeth so that the user can dry the hair using the dryer without a brush or comb.\n\nHair dryers have been cited as an effective treatment for [[head lice]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Atkin|first2=J.

Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hair-hood-dryer.htm//|title=What is a hair hood dryer?|publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Hair dryer brush ===\nA hair dryer brush (also called \"hot air brush\" and \"round brush hair dryer\" and \"hair styler\"<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/official-charcoal-infused-hair-styler-175723337.html</ref>) has the shape of a brush and it is used as a volumizer too.<ref>https://www.insider.com/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-review</ref>\n\nThere are two types of round brush hair dryers \u2013 rotating and static.

His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his [[hair salon]] in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/28/fashion/history-hair-dryers/s/28HAIRDRYERS-slide-KVQ5.html|title=A Lot of Hot Air|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Armenian American]] inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.<ref>Kazanjiadl \"Hair-Drier\" {{US Patent|994259}}, assigned on 6 June 1911</ref>\n\nAround 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zIYLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=91MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5997,3157234|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately {{convert|2|lb|1}}, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of [[thermal shock|overheating]] and [[electrocution]]. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100&nbsp;watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000&nbsp;watts of heat).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Hair-Dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = MadeHow.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when [[Green Electronics Council|GEC]] changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071004071952/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hairdryers.html Electric Hair Dryers]. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Excelsior hair dryer 1962.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1962]]\nThe bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\" />\n\n[[File:Bonnet-hood hair dryer, 1965.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1965]]\n[[File:Bonnet_hair_dryer,_circa_early_1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Bonnet hair dryer, circa early 1970s]]\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture.

It diffuses the jet of air, so that the hair is not blown around while it dries. The hair dries more slowly, at a cooler temperature, and with less physical disturbance. This makes it so that the hair is less likely to frizz and it gives the hair more volume.\n* An airflow concentrator does the opposite of a diffuser. It makes the end of the blow dryer narrower and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot to make it dry rapidly.\n* The comb nozzle attachment is the same as the airflow concentrator, but it ends with comb-like teeth so that the user can dry the hair using the dryer without a brush or comb.\n\nHair dryers have been cited as an effective treatment for [[head lice]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Atkin|first2=J.

Hot air is blown out through tiny openings around the inside of the dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hair-hood-dryer.htm//|title=What is a hair hood dryer?|publisher=WiseGeek|accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Hair dryer brush ===\nA hair dryer brush (also called \"hot air brush\" and \"round brush hair dryer\" and \"hair styler\"<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/official-charcoal-infused-hair-styler-175723337.html</ref>) has the shape of a brush and it is used as a volumizer too.<ref>https://www.insider.com/revlon-one-step-hair-dryer-review</ref>\n\nThere are two types of round brush hair dryers \u2013 rotating and static.

His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his [[hair salon]] in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/28/fashion/history-hair-dryers/s/28HAIRDRYERS-slide-KVQ5.html|title=A Lot of Hot Air|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-05|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Armenian American]] inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911.<ref>Kazanjiadl \"Hair-Drier\" {{US Patent|994259}}, assigned on 6 June 1911</ref>\n\nAround 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zIYLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=91MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5997,3157234|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately {{convert|2|lb|1}}, and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of [[thermal shock|overheating]] and [[electrocution]]. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100&nbsp;watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000&nbsp;watts of heat).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Hair-Dryer.html|title = Hair Dryer|accessdate = 2015-10-26|website = MadeHow.com}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when [[Green Electronics Council|GEC]] changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071004071952/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hairdryers.html Electric Hair Dryers]. ntlworld.com</ref>\n\n[[File:Excelsior hair dryer 1962.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1962]]\nThe bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person's head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.\n\nThe 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person's head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.<ref name=\"homepage.ntlworld.com\" />\n\n[[File:Bonnet-hood hair dryer, 1965.jpg|thumb|Bonnet hair dryer, 1965]]\n[[File:Bonnet_hair_dryer,_circa_early_1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Bonnet hair dryer, circa early 1970s]]\nIn the 1970s, the U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture.

In 1806, he published his first collection of poetry, entitled ''Pesme za poku\u0161ino'' (Poems for Sampling).

In 1809, he wrote a poem, called ''Ilirija o\u017eivljena'' (\"[[Illyria]] Reborn\"), in which he praised [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] for having established the [[Illyrian Provinces]].
