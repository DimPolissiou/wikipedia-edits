It is the sequel to ''[[Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent]]''.  It was released on June 30, 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike the first game, the game structure resembles a linear [[adventure game]] - the player doesn't have an inventory, but can traverse into [[dialog tree]]s with other characters. Some items or choices of dialog result in puzzles to be solved, although in some cases the puzzle has no consequence in the game's progress. The types of puzzles vary from [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw]] through [[mathematical puzzle|math]]s to [[logic puzzle]]s. Each of them has a basic short description about the objective of the puzzle, while some have a basic set of rules and conditions that help the player deduce the solution. The player can request three hints for each puzzle, and each hint costs the player a piece of chewing gum - gum is on shortage in the town, as the hotel clerk explains, but Nelson can collect pieces of used gum he finds at each location. The puzzles don't automatically approve the players solution, even if the player provides the correct answer - Nelson must send the answer back to HQ where it is either approved or rejected. If the solution is approved, the player is given a score depending on how many hints he used and how many failed attempts he had (the latter is represented in taxpayer dollars), and an optional further explanation is provided on how the puzzle can be solved.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=May 2012}}\nWhile on vacation, Tethers appears to be disturbed by the unresolved Scoggins case, noting that the FBI appears to be trying to cover it up. Deciding to go on an unofficial investigation, Tethers leaves his colleague and admirer Jim Ingraham to look after his files before heading back to Scoggins.\n \nUpon arrival, Tethers attempts to check in at Valda's Inn, the local hotel, but receives some hostility from Martha Garret, the owner, who attempts to push him into leaving. Tethers eventually manages to rent out a room, but experiences a dream at night in which he is visited by an astronaut, just like his dream before he first went to Scoggins, this time leaving a note on the floor. Also like the previous dream, Tethers wakes up to find that he was dreaming, but the note on the floor is still there, reading \"Isaac Davner does not exist\" on one side while having a puzzle on the other side. The puzzle consists of the names of a number of unknown people, arranged into a jumbled order, prompting Tethers to find out more about the names mentioned so that he can solve it.\n \nOutside the hotel, Tethers learns from Darryl Boutin, a resident previously seen in the Moose Ear Diner, that the names in the puzzle refer to past residents who have mysteriously disappeared into Sasimy Woods across the past several years, one of them being Darryl's brother, Darrel. Tethers travels to the local campsite, the Wallows, to meet with Alfred Versteckt, an anthropologist whose student, Will Medlock, is also mentioned in the puzzle. Alfred, who is not native to Scoggins and is therefore quickly deemed by Tethers as being \"helpful\", believes that the disappearances may be related to Scoggins' folklore, namely the [[Hulduf\u00f3lk|Hidden People]]. Tethers next heads to the Moose Ear Diner to meet with Sheriff Bahg, and requests access to his files on the 'missing persons' cases, but Bahg, as hostile as ever, quickly denies him. However, Glori Davner, despite previously attempting to kill Tethers, offers to distract Bahg while Tethers breaks into his office if he will promise to find her husband, Isaac. Glori claims that Isaac was being \"troubled\" by something, and the Brotherhood of Scoggins, led by Bjorn, had offered to take him in and help him. However, they had then locked him away in the eraser factory and given him to the Hidden People, simply telling Glori that he had been \"chosen\" when she questioned them. As there has been no news on Isaac's whereabouts since he was stolen away into the woods after Tethers found him, Glori has become distrustful of the Brotherhood, now believing that they are behind the many disappearances.\n \nTethers sneaks into Bahg's office and is able to retrieve the Missing Persons files, despite being caught in the act by Bahg. Using the files, Tethers is able to complete the puzzle on the note, which then leads him to Melkorka Teterdottir, or 'Korka' for short, a puzzle-obsessed woman not unlike himself. Korka explains that she had posted the note under his door at night in an attempt to summon him, as she wishes to partner with him to solve the case. Korka herself has made a remarkable discovery concerning Isaac: his true identity is Ed Davis, a test pilot who had apparently been killed after his craft crashed into Sasimy Woods. Korka believes that the alias of Davner was forged so that Ed Davis could be declared dead, but he is actually residing in the woods as a serial killer, and is therefore responsible for the disappearances. Having become obsessed with taking down Isaac after her lover, Halldor Magnusson, had disappeared many years ago, Korka has devoted her recent years to tracking him, and now wishes to use Tethers to hunt him. Korka sends Tethers out into Sasimy Woods to find Isaac.\n \nIn the woods, Tethers finds no sign of Isaac but instead finds Edvard, a member of the Brotherhood, sneaking around. Tethers follows him through the woods, but loses him and tumbles down a slope. Beneath a tree at the base of the slope, Tethers discovers the crumpled body of an astronaut, but before he can look closer, a group of Hidden People spook him and he flees, eventually ending up back at Korka's house. However, Korka quickly dismisses his findings as nonsense, believing that the Hidden People are nothing more than an urban myth. With no other leads, Tethers heads to the Brotherhood lodge to directly interrogate Bjorn, but finds that he too appears to be troubled by the disappearances, and is innocent. Bjorn reveals that the Brotherhood itself has been shrinking as its members have been vanishing into Sasimy Woods. Edvard, who Tethers had seen in the woods, had been searching for Skjoldr, another Brotherhood member who had gone missing not long ago. Bjorn also states that the Hidden People have been \"angered\" by something nearby, which may have something to do with their \"choosing\" of Isaac. Begging Tethers to find the missing people and restore the Brotherhood, Bjorn directs Tethers to the cabin of Olav Welhaven, another past member who was one of Bjorn's best friends.\n \nTethers reaches Olav's cabin and finds that the man was a dedicated astropsychologist who had invented a complex formula linking lunacy to the phases of the Moon, most notably lunar eclipses. A set of tape recordings reveal that Olav had sent his research to NASA. Tethers realises that Olav's game-changing discovery, as well as his contact with NASA, must play an important role in the mysteries surrounding Scoggins, such as the astronaut body and the Hidden People, and revisits Korka to show her his findings. However, Korka is revealed to be an obsessive lunatic when Tethers discovers that she believes that the entire mystery revolves around the 'Kitimat Incident' - the rumoured discovery of a Sasquatch in Sasimy Woods.\n \nBelieving that Alfred is the only competent person in Scoggins, Tethers returns to the Wallows to show him his findings. Alfred appears to be amazed by Olav's research, noting that when placed besides his own research into the Hidden People, it will pinpoint the creatures' home. Alfred accompanies Tethers into the woods to look for the Hidden People, but before long he disappears; Tethers searches for him and stumbles across a campsite in a large clearing. The campsite appears to have been built around a crashed lunar lander, branded as the 'Hermes II', and is occupied by a pair of astronauts. Tethers spots the remains of a skier nearby, but before he can react, the astronauts grab hold of him and sedate him.\n \nTethers wakes up once again in Valda's Inn, but learns from a call from Ingraham that the FBI has discovered Tethers' findings involving the body of the astronaut, and a task force of Men in Black are en route to Scoggins. Tethers confronts FBI Director Jennings in the Moose Ear Diner and voices his concern that the astronauts in the woods have been murdering people, and are responsible for the disappearances, but Jennings simply warns him to back away from the case and leave Scoggins before he learns too much. Refusing to abandon the case, Tethers returns to the astronaut's body he discovered in the woods and finds that it is not really a body, but an empty suit. To his surprise, Isaac Davner appears behind him and reveals that the suit belonged to him. Isaac explains that, previously known as Ed Davis, he was in the team of astronauts who were sent to the Moon on the Hermes II mission, a secret operation in response to Olav Welhaven's research in which the team were ordered to plant a device called the 'Lunar Ray' on the surface. However, the mission had gone awry; a lunar eclipse had occurred before the team had reached the surface, causing the two astronauts on the outside of the craft to instantly go insane. With the Lunar Ray still attached to the lander, Isaac had piloted the craft back towards Earth, where it crashed into Sasimy Woods - directly on top of the Hidden People's home. The Lunar Ray had formed a barrier around the area which repelled the Hidden People, forcing them out of their habitat. Isaac had fled the crash site upon impact, running from the two insane astronauts, and had created the new identity of Isaac Davner in an attempt to forget the mission and start a new life. From there, he had settled down with Glori and begun a peaceful career as the eraser factory foreman, but the astronauts continued to haunt him in his dreams so he went to Bjorn for help. The Hidden People, who were aware that Isaac had been involved in the Hermes II mission, had \"chosen\" him so that Bjorn would hand him over, and they had whispered to him in an attempt to brainwash him into destroying the Ray. When Tethers had found him in the factory, and he had been dragged away into the woods, the Hidden People had actually taken him back to the lander, but he had been unable to stop the Ray and had fled back into the woods, where he has been hiding ever since.\n \nNow understanding that the Hidden People are simply being disturbed by the Ray, Tethers agrees to assist Isaac in destroying it. The two head to the lander, but find that the Men in Black have got there first, although the insane astronauts have been apprehended. The agents take the pair back to the town, returning Tethers to Valda's Inn while presumably reuniting Isaac with Glori. Tethers receives another phone call from Ingraham, who has been studying Tethers' many recordings throughout his two visits to Scoggins. Ingraham points out that there is a strange melody in the background of Olav Welhaven's recording. Realising that Olav must have had direct contact with the Hidden People in order to reach his bizarre conclusion, Tethers deduces that the melody was used to summon the Hidden People to the cabin. Tethers heads back to the cabin and replays the recording, causing a large crowd of Hidden People to enter, one of them climbing onto a stool and whispering into Tethers' ear.\n \nAs a result of the whispers, Tethers experiences a strange illusion in which he contacts the Hidden People in space, apparently agreeing to assist them in destroying the Ray. When he snaps back into consciousness, he is already at the lander in his underwear, surrounded by agents. Tethers is able to sabotage the Ray, but it goes haywire and begins to zap the agents, turning them insane, Tethers is also hit by the ray and he goes insane as well. He then rushes away from the lander with the Ray, moving the barrier blocking the Hidden People away from the campsite and allowing them to return home. Tethers carries the Ray to Lake Svenz and attempts to throw it into the water, but the thick layer of ice on the surface prevents it from falling through. However, the Sasquatch which Korka had theorised about suddenly emerges from the trees near the lake and splits the ice, sinking the Ray to the bottom and finally ending its reign of lunacy over Scoggins.\n \nDespite going against his orders from Director Jennings, Tethers is allowed to return to the FBI, although Ingraham is relocated as he had assisted Tethers despite still being on shifts. Tethers receives a postcard from Isaac and Glori, who have happily reunited and are on vacation in Bermuda. The game ends as Tethers questions their safety, clearly concerned about the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n==Reception==\n''Puzzle Agent 2'' was the first runner up for \"Best Mobile Game\" in the [[1UP.com]] Best of E3 awards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/features/best-of-e3 | title = 1UP's Best Games of E3 2011 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | date = 2011-06-10 | accessdate = 2012-01-06}}</ref>  It was also the first runner up for \"Best iPhone/iPad Game\" and the second runner up for \"Best Puzzle Game\" in the [[IGN]] Best of E3 awards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://games.ign.com/articles/116/1165247p1.html | title = E3 2011: Best of E3 Awards | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2011-06-10 | accessdate = 2012-01-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official|https://telltale.com/series/puzzle-agent-2/}}\n\n{{Telltale Games}}\n\n[[Category:2011 video games]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:Telltale Games games]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games based on comics]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jared Emerson-Johnson]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title     = Puzzle Agent 2\n| image     = Puzzle Agent 2 cover.png\n| developer = [[Telltale Games]]\n| publisher = Telltale Games\n| director  = Jonathan Sgro\n| designer  = [[Graham Annable]]\n| writer    = Graham Annable<br>[[Chuck Jordan (game designer)|Chuck Jordan]]<br>[[Sean Vanaman]]\n| programmer= Tulley Rafferty\n| engine    = [[Telltale Tool]]\n| composer  = [[Jared Emerson-Johnson]]<br />Rich Vreeland<br />Nick Mastroianni\n| released  = June 30, 2011\n| genre     = [[Adventure game|Adventure]]/[[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]\n| modes     = [[Single-player]]\n| platforms = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]]\n}}\n'''''Puzzle Agent 2''''' is an adventure/puzzle game by [[Telltale Games]], in collaboration with [[Graham Annable]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent]]''.  It was released on June 30, 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\nLike the first game, the game structure resembles a linear [[adventure game]] - the player doesn't have an inventory, but can traverse into [[dialog tree]]s with other characters. Some items or choices of dialog result in puzzles to be solved, although in some cases the puzzle has no consequence in the game's progress. The types of puzzles vary from [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw]] through [[mathematical puzzle|math]]s to [[logic puzzle]]s. Each of them has a basic short description about the objective of the puzzle, while some have a basic set of rules and conditions that help the player deduce the solution. The player can request three hints for each puzzle, and each hint costs the player a piece of chewing gum - gum is on shortage in the town, as the hotel clerk explains, but Nelson can collect pieces of used gum he finds at each location. The puzzles don't automatically approve the players solution, even if the player provides the correct answer - Nelson must send the answer back to HQ where it is either approved or rejected. If the solution is approved, the player is given a score depending on how many hints he used and how many failed attempts he had (the latter is represented in taxpayer dollars), and an optional further explanation is provided on how the puzzle can be solved.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=May 2012}}\nWhile on vacation, Tethers appears to be disturbed by the unresolved Scoggins case, noting that the FBI appears to be trying to cover it up. Deciding to go on an unofficial investigation, Tethers leaves his colleague and admirer Jim Ingraham to look after his files before heading back to Scoggins.\n \nUpon arrival, Tethers attempts to check in at Valda's Inn, the local hotel, but receives some hostility from Martha Garret, the owner, who attempts to push him into leaving. Tethers eventually manages to rent out a room, but experiences a dream at night in which he is visited by an astronaut, just like his dream before he first went to Scoggins, this time leaving a note on the floor. Also like the previous dream, Tethers wakes up to find that he was dreaming, but the note on the floor is still there, reading \"Isaac Davner does not exist\" on one side while having a puzzle on the other side. The puzzle consists of the names of a number of unknown people, arranged into a jumbled order, prompting Tethers to find out more about the names mentioned so that he can solve it.\n \nOutside the hotel, Tethers learns from Darryl Boutin, a resident previously seen in the Moose Ear Diner, that the names in the puzzle refer to past residents who have mysteriously disappeared into Sasimy Woods across the past several years, one of them being Darryl's brother, Darrel. Tethers travels to the local campsite, the Wallows, to meet with Alfred Versteckt, an anthropologist whose student, Will Medlock, is also mentioned in the puzzle. Alfred, who is not native to Scoggins and is therefore quickly deemed by Tethers as being \"helpful\", believes that the disappearances may be related to Scoggins' folklore, namely the [[Hulduf\u00f3lk|Hidden People]]. Tethers next heads to the Moose Ear Diner to meet with Sheriff Bahg, and requests access to his files on the 'missing persons' cases, but Bahg, as hostile as ever, quickly denies him. However, Glori Davner, despite previously attempting to kill Tethers, offers to distract Bahg while Tethers breaks into his office if he will promise to find her husband, Isaac. Glori claims that Isaac was being \"troubled\" by something, and the Brotherhood of Scoggins, led by Bjorn, had offered to take him in and help him. However, they had then locked him away in the eraser factory and given him to the Hidden People, simply telling Glori that he had been \"chosen\" when she questioned them. As there has been no news on Isaac's whereabouts since he was stolen away into the woods after Tethers found him, Glori has become distrustful of the Brotherhood, now believing that they are behind the many disappearances.\n \nTethers sneaks into Bahg's office and is able to retrieve the Missing Persons files, despite being caught in the act by Bahg. Using the files, Tethers is able to complete the puzzle on the note, which then leads him to Melkorka Teterdottir, or 'Korka' for short, a puzzle-obsessed woman not unlike himself. Korka explains that she had posted the note under his door at night in an attempt to summon him, as she wishes to partner with him to solve the case. Korka herself has made a remarkable discovery concerning Isaac: his true identity is Ed Davis, a test pilot who had apparently been killed after his craft crashed into Sasimy Woods. Korka believes that the alias of Davner was forged so that Ed Davis could be declared dead, but he is actually residing in the woods as a serial killer, and is therefore responsible for the disappearances. Having become obsessed with taking down Isaac after her lover, Halldor Magnusson, had disappeared many years ago, Korka has devoted her recent years to tracking him, and now wishes to use Tethers to hunt him. Korka sends Tethers out into Sasimy Woods to find Isaac.\n \nIn the woods, Tethers finds no sign of Isaac but instead finds Edvard, a member of the Brotherhood, sneaking around. Tethers follows him through the woods, but loses him and tumbles down a slope. Beneath a tree at the base of the slope, Tethers discovers the crumpled body of an astronaut, but before he can look closer, a group of Hidden People spook him and he flees, eventually ending up back at Korka's house. However, Korka quickly dismisses his findings as nonsense, believing that the Hidden People are nothing more than an urban myth. With no other leads, Tethers heads to the Brotherhood lodge to directly interrogate Bjorn, but finds that he too appears to be troubled by the disappearances, and is innocent. Bjorn reveals that the Brotherhood itself has been shrinking as its members have been vanishing into Sasimy Woods. Edvard, who Tethers had seen in the woods, had been searching for Skjoldr, another Brotherhood member who had gone missing not long ago. Bjorn also states that the Hidden People have been \"angered\" by something nearby, which may have something to do with their \"choosing\" of Isaac. Begging Tethers to find the missing people and restore the Brotherhood, Bjorn directs Tethers to the cabin of Olav Welhaven, another past member who was one of Bjorn's best friends.\n \nTethers reaches Olav's cabin and finds that the man was a dedicated astropsychologist who had invented a complex formula linking lunacy to the phases of the Moon, most notably lunar eclipses.

VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network ([[VTVCab]]) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 ([[VIE Gi\u1ea3i Tr\u00ed]] ), VTVCab2 ([[Phim Vi\u1ec7t]]), VTVCab3 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV]]), VTVCab4 ([[V\u0103n Ho\u00e1/LOVE]]), VTVCab5 ([[E Channel]]), [[VTVCab6]] (Hay TV), VTVCab7 ([[O2TV]]), VTVCab8 ([[BiBi]]), VTVCab9 ([[Info TV]]), VTVCab10 ([[VIE Dramas]]), VTVCab11 ([[TV Shopping]], now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 ([[Style TV]]), VTVCab14 ([[Lotte \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t Homeshopping]], now VShopping), VTVCab15 ([[UM Channel]]), VTVCab16 ([[B\u00f3ng \u0110\u00e1 TV]]), VTVCab17 ([[Yeah1 TV]]), VTVCab 18 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV HD Tin t\u1ee9c]]), VTVCab19 ([[Film]]), VTVCab20 ([[V Family]]), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 ([[Life TV]]), VTVCab 23 ([[Golf TV]]) & about 45 local & international channels.\n[[File:VTC logo 2018.svg|right|frameless|293x293px]]\n\n===Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC)===\n\n{{Main|Vietnam Multimedia Corporation}}\n\nVTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.  VTC's DTT service is a subscription service though unauthorized cloning of the signal is rampant.\n\nVTC is a Vietnamese state-owned corporation under Ministry of Post and Telematics (currently the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]])  . It has 4 FTA channels, which is VTC1 - the generalist and news channel, VTC5 - the entertainment channel, TodayTV-VTC7 - the entertainment and series channel, and VTC9 -the Vietnamese entertainment channel, and a number of subscription channels including [[VTC2]] - the economic & ICT channel, [[VTC3]] - The sport & entertainment channel, [[VTC4]] - the fashion and style channel, [[VTC6]] - the movie channel. Three new channels broadcast for examination in 2008 are [[VTC8]] - the second VTC1, [[VTC13]] the music channel and [[VTC11]] - kids-oriented channel, and finally [[VTC12]] - concurrently the Korean-language channel. Since 2010 VTC also launching three channels under deposit appications from the government, these are [[VTC10 - NETVIET]], the cultural and foreign affairs channel, [[VTC14]], Weather and Natural Disaster, and [[VTC16]] (3NTV) - Agriculture-oriented channel\n\nIn 2006, [[VTC Mobile TV]], one of the world's first subscription TV services for mobile phones, became available using [[DVB-H]]. It is operated by [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation]], owners of VTC.\n\nFrom 1/1/2014, VTC Television Network separated from VTC Corporations and transferred to the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]]. From 27/6/2015 the network was transferred to the Radio the [[ Voice of Vietnam ]] and become the television enterprise agency of the network.\n\n===Local stations===\n{{Main|List of local stations in Vietnam}}\n[[File:Logo of Ho Chi Minh Television.svg|252x252px|right]]\nThese include [[Hanoi Radio Television]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTV). The latter is available over most of the [[Mekong Delta]].\n\n===Other subscription TV===\nSince 1991, hotels, restaurants, clubs, government offices and diplomatic organizations in Vietnam have been permitted under license to install and operate satellite dishes to bring in foreign programming. Nowadays, most of people in large cities (such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) subscribe to a cable network. The largest network is [[VCTV (Vietnam)|VCTV]]/[[VTVCab]] (a division of VTV), follows by that of [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTVC), [[Hanoi TV]] (HCAtv/Hanoicab), and [[Saigontourist Cable Television Company|Saigon Tourist Cable Service]] (SCTV) - a joint venture between VTV and Saigon Tourist company. The latest payTV supplier is K+ which is a joint venture between Vietnam Cable Television (VTVCab) and [[Canal+]], first broadcast in later 2009 via [[Direct To Home]] (DTH), and An Vi\u00ean Television Service, owned by Audio Visual Global JSC, first broadcast in 2011 via both [[DVB-T2]] [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) and [[Direct To Home]] (DTH)\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Vovlogo.png|270x270px|right]]\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nPrior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.\n\nVietnam's national radio station, now called the [[Voice of Vietnam]], started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world:\n* VOV1 (MW and SW) - news, current affairs and music\n* VOV2 (MW and SW) - cultural and social programs\n* VOV3 (FM) - music & entertainment\n* VOV4 (MW) - [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority language]] programming\n* VOV5 (MW) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages\n* VOV6 (MW and SW) - artistic-oriented programs, currently a block on VOV2\n* VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams.\n* VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs\n* VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering\n* VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects\n* VOVTV (Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which aims at delivering update news every 30 minutes per program.\n* VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website\nAs of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, most cities and provinces has their own radio stations.\n* *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193140/http://www.delicest.com/2013/09/radio-stations-viet-nam-nghe-truc-tuyen.html Vietnam Radio Stations Online Full List Updated 2013 ] Listen all Vietnam AM / FM Radio Stations Online\n\n==Newspapers==\nAs Vietnam moves toward a free-market economy with its [[doi moi]] measures, the government has relied on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies. The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]].

During the 1990s, it had a copyright infringement with [[DWKX|103.5 K-Lite]] with its use of the stinger \"it's the true light rock\" and \"light rock with a kick\". Back then, its studios were located at the FEMS Tower 1 in Osme\u00f1a Highway, Manila. They also owned Ultravision 25 (now [[Net 25]], owned by [[Eagle Broadcasting Corporation]]).\n\nDuring the 2000s until its acquisition by MBC, it hosted events and played music that inspired a generation up to October 26, 2008 when its DJ's aired the final edition of \"Lite Rock Favorites of the Week\" with DJs Cherry Bayle (now with [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]]) and Dylan Thomas.<ref>[http://pakshet101.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/goodbye-963-wrock-thanks-for-the-memories/]</ref>\n\nOn October 6, 2008, it has been announced that the Elizalde Group of Companies' Manila Broadcasting Company has purchased WRocK from the Hodreal's ACWS-UBN, for PhP229.6 million.

Some items or choices of dialog result in puzzles to be solved, although in some cases the puzzle has no consequence in the game's progress.

Each of them has a basic short description about the objective of the puzzle, while some have a basic set of rules and conditions that help the player deduce the solution. The player can request three hints for each puzzle, and each hint costs the player a piece of chewing gum - gum is on shortage in the town, as the hotel clerk explains, but Nelson can collect pieces of used gum he finds at each location. The puzzles don't automatically approve the players solution, even if the player provides the correct answer - Nelson must send the answer back to HQ where it is either approved or rejected. If the solution is approved, the player is given a score depending on how many hints he used and how many failed attempts he had (the latter is represented in taxpayer dollars), and an optional further explanation is provided on how the puzzle can be solved.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game begins as Agent Nelson Tethers, the sole member of the Puzzle Research Division of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], is given his first field assignment. The factory that produces the [[eraser]]s used by the [[White House]] has stopped production; any attempts to contact the factory are met with bizarre puzzles. Tethers must visit the factory in Scoggins, [[Minnesota]] and get it running again.\n\nIn Scoggins, Tethers is told that the factory was closed after an unidentified accident, and that the factory's foreman, Isaac Davner, hasn't been seen since. Further investigation is impossible because the factory is sealed by a complex lock requiring three keys.\n\nTethers' search for the keys and for additional clues to Isaac's whereabouts is hindered by mysterious gnome-like creatures called the [[Hulduf\u00f3lk|Hidden People]] by the townspeople. The Hidden People seem to be supported by a local lodge called the Brotherhood of Scoggins. The lodge head, Bjorn, tells Tethers that the Hidden People have \u201cchosen\u201d Isaac, though he is unable to explain exactly what that means. \n\nFinally, Tethers gains entry to the factory. Inside, he finds Isaac, driven mad by puzzles given to him by the Hidden People. Tethers tries to rescue Isaac, but the Hidden People drag Isaac off before he can be saved. The factory starts back up soon afterward. Back in Washington, Tethers is congratulated for his work, and is reminded that the disappearance of Isaac is a matter for local law enforcement.\n\nThe story continues in the sequel, ''[[Puzzle Agent 2]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/995862-puzzle-agent/index.html ''Puzzle Agent''] at [[GameRankings]]\n* [http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/puzzleagent ''Puzzle Agent''] at [[Metacritic]]\n\n{{Telltale Games}}\n\n[[Category:2010 video games]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Wii games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:Telltale Games games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on comics]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jared Emerson-Johnson]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title     = Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent\n| image     = Puzzle Agent cover.jpg\n| caption   = Steam header\n| developer = [[Telltale Games]]\n| publisher = Telltale Games\n| producer  = Matt Hansen\n| designer  = [[Graham Annable]]<br>[[Mark Darin]]\n| writer    = Graham Annable<br>Mark Darin\n| artist    = Jonathan Sgro\n| programmer= Robert Oates\n| engine    = [[Telltale Tool]]\n| composer  = [[Jared Emerson-Johnson]]<br />[[Rich Vreeland]]<br />[[Nick Mastroianni]]\n| released  = June 30, 2010\n| genre     = [[Adventure game|Adventure]]/[[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]\n| modes     =\n| platforms = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation Network]], [[iOS]]\n}}\n'''''Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent''''' (also known simply as '''''Puzzle Agent''''') is an adventure/puzzle game by [[Telltale Games]], in collaboration with [[Graham Annable]].

Galesburg played in the [[Central Association]] (1910\u20131912, 1914), [[Illinois-Missouri League]] (1908\u20131909), Eastern Iowa League (1895), Central Inter-State League (1890) and [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1890). \n\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] (1909) and [[Sam Rice]] (1912) played for Galesburg.\n\n==History==\nProfessional baseball started in Galesburg in 1890, with two teams playing in two leagues. Galesburg first played in the [[Central Interstate League]] League. Galesburg was 6-22, when the team moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] on May 27, 1890. Then, on July 31, 1890, the Sterling Blue Coats of the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] moved to Galesburg. After an 8\u201317 record in Galesburg, the team moved to a third home, in [[Burlington, Iowa]], where the team became the [[Burlington Hawkeyes]]. Burlington folded after a handful of games and a 30-72 overall record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/stats/t-sc14784/y-1890|title=1890 Sterling Blue Coats/Galesburg/Burlington Statistics on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Central_Inter-State_League|title=Central Inter-State League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nProfessional baseball returned  when the '''Galesburg Trotters''' played in the 1895 Eastern Iowa League. 1895 was the only year of existence for the Independent league. The 1895 Eastern Iowa League was composed of the [[Burlington Spiders]] (52\u201339), [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]] (43\u201351), [[Clinton Bridegrooms]] (11\u201326), [[Dubuque Colts]] (66\u201331), Galesburg Trotters (13\u201327), Ottumwa Brownies (49\u201352), [[Rock Island Tri-Cities]] (14\u201318) and Waterloo Indians (21\u201325).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-EIAL/y-1895|title=1895 Eastern Iowa League (EIL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the '''Galesburg Hornets''' were founded and joined the Class D [[Illinois-Missouri League]]. Other charter members of the 1908 league were the Canton Chinks, [[Hannibal Cannibals]], Havana Perfectors, Macomb Potters and [[Monmouth Browns]]. The Galesburg Hornets had four different managers and finished last at 50\u201367.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Illinois-Missouri_League|title=Illinois-Missouri League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nGalesburg remained in the [[Illinois-Missouri League]] in 1909, playing as the '''Galesburg Boosters'''. The team again finished last in the six-team league with a 47\u201383 record. Then known as \"Pete\" Alexander, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] pitched and played some outfield for the 1909 Boosters. At age 22, Alexander was 15\u20138 with a 1.36 ERA and hit .243 in 107 at bats. Alexander was badly injured when he was struck by a throw while baserunning, ending his 1909 season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=1909 Galesburg Boosters Statistics|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref name=\"greatath\">{{cite book |last1=Fiero |first1=John W |editor1-first=Dawn P |editor1-last=Dawson |title=Great Athletes |edition=Revised |volume=1 |year=2002 |origyear=1992 |publisher=Salem Press |isbn=1-58765-008-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatathletes0000unse/page/32 32\u201334] |url=https://archive.org/details/greatathletes0000unse/page/32 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the Galesburg Pavers replaced the [[Waterloo Lulus]] in the eight-team Class D [[Central Association]]. The Pavers finished 69-67 (4th) in 1910; 66-63 (3rd) in 1911 and 61-67 (6th) in 1912. The Pavers folded after the 1912 season along with the [[Hannibal Cannibals]]. Galesburg drew 18,000 fans for the 1912 season, an average of 281 per game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Central_Association|title=Central Association - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/roster/t-gp11666/y-1912|title=1912 Galesburg Pavers Roster on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref name=\"baseball-reference2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/league.cgi?code=CENA&class=D|title=Central Association (D) Encyclopedia and History|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Sam Rice]] began the season with the Galesburg Pavers, playing in exhibition games. However, Rice left the team when his wife, two children, both of his parents and two sisters were killed in a tornado on April 21, 1912.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/593ed95f</ref>[[File:Sam Rice, Washington AL (baseball) LCCN2014701441.tif|thumb|Sam Rice, Washington AL 1916.

When it was decided that both Galesburg and Hannibal would be folded, Galesburg was awarded $500 for its players. Galesburg then made a failed attempt to join the Three-I League.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.galesburg.com/article/20080611/NEWS/306119891|title=WILSON: Life in Galesburg's minor league baseball|first=Tom|last=Wilson|website=The Register-Mail}}</ref>\n\nThe Galesburg Pavers made a brief return to the [[Central Association]] in 1914. The [[Central Association]] member [[Ottumwa Packers]] moved to [[Rock Island, Illinois]] on July 17, 1914 and began play as the [[Rock Island Islanders]]. However, on July 24, 1914, after a few games in Rock Island, the franchise was forced to move to Galesburg to play the remainder of the season after losing a territorial dispute with the [[Three-I League]]. After finishing the 1914 season in 8th place at 49\u201379, the franchise did not return in 1915.

Galesburg played in the [[Central Association]] (1910\u20131912, 1914), [[Illinois-Missouri League]] (1908\u20131909), Eastern Iowa League (1895), Central Inter-State League (1890) and [[Illinois-Iowa League]] (1890). \n\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] (1909) and [[Sam Rice]] (1912) played for Galesburg.\n\n==History==\nProfessional baseball started in Galesburg in 1890, with two teams playing in two leagues. Galesburg first played in the [[Central Interstate League]] League. Galesburg was 6-22, when the team moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] on May 27, 1890. Then, on July 31, 1890, the Sterling Blue Coats of the [[Illinois-Iowa League]] moved to Galesburg. After an 8\u201317 record in Galesburg, the team moved to a third home, in [[Burlington, Iowa]], where the team became the [[Burlington Hawkeyes]]. Burlington folded after a handful of games and a 30-72 overall record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/stats/t-sc14784/y-1890|title=1890 Sterling Blue Coats/Galesburg/Burlington Statistics on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Central_Inter-State_League|title=Central Inter-State League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nProfessional baseball returned  when the '''Galesburg Trotters''' played in the 1895 Eastern Iowa League. 1895 was the only year of existence for the Independent league. The 1895 Eastern Iowa League was composed of the [[Burlington Spiders]] (52\u201339), [[Cedar Rapids Rabbits]] (43\u201351), [[Clinton Bridegrooms]] (11\u201326), [[Dubuque Colts]] (66\u201331), Galesburg Trotters (13\u201327), Ottumwa Brownies (49\u201352), [[Rock Island Tri-Cities]] (14\u201318) and Waterloo Indians (21\u201325).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statscrew.com/minorbaseball/l-EIAL/y-1895|title=1895 Eastern Iowa League (EIL) on StatsCrew.com|website=www.statscrew.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the '''Galesburg Hornets''' were founded and joined the Class D [[Illinois-Missouri League]]. Other charter members of the 1908 league were the Canton Chinks, [[Hannibal Cannibals]], Havana Perfectors, Macomb Potters and [[Monmouth Browns]]. The Galesburg Hornets had four different managers and finished last at 50\u201367.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Illinois-Missouri_League|title=Illinois-Missouri League - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nGalesburg remained in the [[Illinois-Missouri League]] in 1909, playing as the '''Galesburg Boosters'''. The team again finished last in the six-team league with a 47\u201383 record. Then known as \"Pete\" Alexander, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] pitched and played some outfield for the 1909 Boosters. At age 22, Alexander was 15\u20138 with a 1.36 ERA and hit .243 in 107 at bats. Alexander was badly injured when he was struck by a throw while baserunning, ending his 1909 season.<ref name=\"baseball-reference\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi|title=1909 Galesburg Boosters Statistics|website=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref name=\"greatath\">{{cite book |last1=Fiero |first1=John W |editor1-first=Dawn P |editor1-last=Dawson |title=Great Athletes |edition=Revised |volume=1 |year=2002 |origyear=1992 |publisher=Salem Press |isbn=1-58765-008-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatathletes0000unse/page/32 32\u201334] |url=https://archive.org/details/greatathletes0000unse/page/32 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the Galesburg Pavers replaced the [[Waterloo Lulus]] in the eight-team Class D [[Central Association]]. The Pavers finished 69-67 (4th) in 1910; 66-63 (3rd) in 1911 and 61-67 (6th) in 1912. The Pavers folded after the 1912 season along with the [[Hannibal Cannibals]].

However, Rice left the team when his wife, two children, both of his parents and two sisters were killed in a tornado on April 21, 1912.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/593ed95f</ref>[[File:Sam Rice, Washington AL (baseball) LCCN2014701441.tif|thumb|Sam Rice, Washington AL 1916.

When it was decided that both Galesburg and Hannibal would be folded, Galesburg was awarded $500 for its players. Galesburg then made a failed attempt to join the Three-I League.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.galesburg.com/article/20080611/NEWS/306119891|title=WILSON: Life in Galesburg's minor league baseball|first=Tom|last=Wilson|website=The Register-Mail}}</ref>\n\nThe Galesburg Pavers made a brief return to the [[Central Association]] in 1914. The [[Central Association]] member [[Ottumwa Packers]] moved to [[Rock Island, Illinois]] on July 17, 1914 and began play as the [[Rock Island Islanders]]. However, on July 24, 1914, after a few games in Rock Island, the franchise was forced to move to Galesburg to play the remainder of the season after losing a territorial dispute with the [[Three-I League]]. After finishing the 1914 season in 8th place at 49\u201379, the franchise did not return in 1915.

Common types of body decoration include:\n* Belly rings: Belly rings decorate the navel area. This jewelry comes in styles with dangling charms or gemstones as well as fake studs.\n* Monroes: Named after actress Marilyn Monroe's famous beauty mark, monroes are imitation studs that are placed above the upper lip on either the right or left side of the mouth. Some faux monroes are gemstones and others have a design.\n* Lip hoops: Small lip hoops are easy to attach because many simply clip on. They come in traditional silver or gold, and other colors ranging from red to blue.\n* Nipple shields: Nipple shields for a pierced look vary from simple metal shapes to elaborate metal designs. Small stud-like and dangle type designs are also available.\n* Plugs: Cheater plugs look like the real thing without any ear stretching. Many screw on to fit. Some are simply plug designs attached to a stud that requires traditional ear piercing and won't work for non-pierced ears.\n\n== Quality ==\nPierced-look jewelry is available in a range of materials at various price ranges. people can find stainless steel, sterling silver, and titanium jewelry, as well as 14K yellow and white gold pieces. People with metal allergies should look for jewelry labeled as nickel-free or hypoallergenic. Stainless steel jewelry, yellow gold and titanium is sometimes an option for some people with metal allergies, but even these can be an issue for others. Be careful with plated metals, sterling silver and white gold because they may contain nickel.The higher end items tend to have better craftsmanship and last longer. Cheaper clip-on jewelry is typically lower quality and may not be as durable. If possible, examine the jewelry before purchase for overall quality and check to make sure the fasteners don't have sharp edges or loose fittings.\n\n== Tips for trying out ==\n* Here are some tips for trying out non piercing body jewelry: \n* Pick jewelry styles that work with their wardrobe and lifestyle. If people decide to get a piercing, the look should fit their personal style. \n* Be aware of how a temporary jewelry piece fastens and keep it fastened correctly. The magnetic type can be tricky and sometimes dangerous, such as magnetic [[labret]]s for chins that fit between the cheeks and gums. Be careful not to swallow this type of jewelry. \n* Follow the manufacturer's instructions for how to wear the jewelry and care for it. \n* How do others react to their body jewelry?
