In 1137, the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were unified under a single dynasty, creating what modern historians call the [[Crown of Aragon]]; however, Aragon and Catalonia retained their own political structure and legal traditions, developing separate political communities along the next centuries. Under [[Alfons II of Aragon|Alfons I the Troubador]] (reigned 1164\u20131196), Catalonia was regarded as a legal entity for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sesma Mu\u00f1oz |first=Jos\u00e9 Angel |title=La Corona de Arag\u00f3n.

Catalonia contributed to further develop the Crown trade and military, most significantly their navy. Catalan language flourished and expanded as more territories were added to the Crown, including [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Athens]], constituting a [[thalassocracy]] across the Mediterranean. The [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crisis of the 14th century]], the end of the rule of [[House of Barcelona]] (1410) and a [[Catalan Civil War|civil war]] (1462\u20131472) weakened the role of the Principality in Crown and international affairs.\n\nThe marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 laid the foundations of the [[Monarchy of Spain]]. In 1492 the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] began, and political power began to shift away towards [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy, alongside the peasants' revolts provoked the [[Reapers' War]] (1640\u20131659). By the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] the Roussillon was ceded to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon supported the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Habsburg]]. After the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u201314)|surrender of Barcelona in 1714]], king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]], inspired by the French model, imposed [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] and a unifying administration across Spain, and enacted the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] for every realm of the Crown of Aragon, which suppressed the main Catalan, Aragonese, Valencian and Majorcan political institutions and rights and merged them into the Crown of Castile as provinces. However, the Principality of Catalonia remained as an administrative unit until the establishment of the Spanish provincial division of 1833, which divided Catalonia into four provinces.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Catalonia}}\n\n===Origins===\nLike much of the Mediterranean coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it was colonized by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who chose to settle in [[Roses, Girona|Roses]]. Both Greeks and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] interacted with the main [[Iberians|Iberian]] population. After the Carthaginian defeat, it became, along with the rest of [[Hispania]], a part of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Tarraco]] being one of the main Roman posts in the Iberian Peninsula and the capital of the province of [[Tarraconensis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chaytor|1933|pp=5-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Guifred1Barcelonsky.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Wilfred the Hairy, depicted in the ''Genealogy of the Kings of Aragon'', c. 1400]]\nThe [[Goths|Visigoths]] ruled after the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s collapse near the end of the 5th century.

After the defeat of Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqiwas's troops at [[Battle of Tours|Tours]] in 732, the [[Franks]] gradually gained control of the former Visigoth territories north of the Pyrenees, which had been captured by the Muslims or had become allied with them, in what is today Catalonia under French administration. In 795, [[Charlemagne]] created what came to be known by historiography and some Frankish [[Chronicle|chronicles]] as the [[Marca Hispanica]], a [[buffer zone]] beyond the province of [[Septimania]], made up of locally administered separate [[counties]] which served as a defensive barrier between the [[Umayyad]] of Al-Andalus and the [[Frankish Kingdom]].<ref name=Ramos>{{cite book|last=Ramos|first=Luis G-G|title=Las Invasiones Barbaras en Hispania y la Creaci\u00f3n del Reino Visigodo|year=2002|publisher=Ariel|location=Barcelona|isbn=978-84-344-6668-5|pages=3\u201330}}</ref>\n\nA distinctive Catalan culture started to develop in the [[Middle Ages]] stemming from a number of these small counties throughout the northernmost part of Catalonia. The [[List of Counts of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]] were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the Carolingian emperor then the king of the Franks, to whom they were feudatories (801\u2013988). In 878, [[Wilfred the Hairy]], count of Urgell and Cerdanya, was appointed count of Barcelona, Girona and Osona. Since then, these last three counties were always ruled by the same person, becoming the political core of the future Principality of Catalonia. Upon his death in 897 Wilfred made their titles hereditaries and thus founded the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona]], which ruled Catalonia until the death of Martin I, its last ruling member, in 1410.\n\n[[File:Comtats catalans 1035.svg|thumb|left|200px|The County of Barcelona (in blue-grey) at the death of Ramon Berenguer III (1131)]]\nIn 988 count [[Borrell II]] did not recognise the Frankish king [[Hugh Capet]] and his new dynasty, effectively taking Barcelona out of Frankish rule.<ref>Salrach Josep M\u00aa.

At the start of 11th century the Catalan Counties suffer an important process of feudalisation, as the miles formed links of vassalage over this previously independent peasantry. The middle years of the century were characterized by virulent class warfare. Seigniorial violence was unleashed against the peasants, utilizing new military tactics, based on contracting well armed mercenary soldiers mounted on horses. By the end of the century, most of the aloers had been converted into vassals.<ref>Bisson, Thomas No\u00ebl. Tormented voices.

This political entity was part of some composite monarchies or dynastic conglomerates as the Crown of Aragon, the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of France]] (1641\u20131652), being on an equal footing with other political communities of the time, or external in relation to such great empires, as were the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Valencia, [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] or the [[Duchy of Milan]], for example.<ref>{{harvnb|Baydal, Palomo|2020|p=109}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Nueva Planta decrees of 1716 at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714) and the subsequent dismantling of Catalan institutional system, the territory being annexed to Castile became a province of the new and more unified Kingdom of Bourbon Spain, but \"principality\" continued to be the definition of the territory, as witness the Nueva Planta decrees created the [[Royal Audience of Catalonia (Bourbon)|Royal Audience of the Principality of Catalonia]] in 1716. This situation remained until the Kingdom of Spain was transformed permanently, despite several [[Carlist Wars]], into a liberal state in 1833, when Secretary Javier de Burgos eliminated the province of the Principality of Catalonia, dividing the territory in four provinces that still exist. Thus, the term disappeared from the administrative and political reality of the country.\n\nNeither the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]], [[Spanish Constitution]] nor [[French Constitution]], mention this denomination, but, despite most of them being republican, it is moderately popular among [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]]s and [[Catalan independentism|independentist]]s.\n\n==Government and law==\nThe political system of the Principality of Catalonia and the other realms of the Crown of Aragon has been defined by historyography as \"pactism\". It designate the explicit or tacit pact between king and kingdom (in its organic and estamental representation), which decisively limited the royal power.\n\n===Institutions===\n[[File:Cortes Catalanas.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The Catalan Courts (parliament) in the 15th century, presided over by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]]]\n[[File:Segellmajor-generalitat-catalunya.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Seal of the Deputation of the General or Generalitat of Catalonia, showing [[Saint George]], the patron saint of this institution]]\n* ''Cort General de Catalunya'' or ''Corts Catalanes'' ([[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]] or Catalan Courts): parliamentary body and main institution of the Principality, created during the 13th century.

Yellow and brown territories were lordships without a veguer]]\nThe ''[[vegueria]]'' was a territorial organization of Catalonia headed by a ''veguer'' (Latin: ''vigerius''). The origins of the vegueria go back to the era of the Carolingian Empire, when [[vicars]] (Latin: ''vicarii'', singular ''vicarius'') were installed beneath the counts in the Marca Hispanica. The office of a vicar was a vicariate (Latin: ''vicariatus'') and his territory was a vicaria. All these Latin terms of Carolingian administration evolved in the Catalan language.\n\nThe veguer was appointed by the king and was accountable to him. He was the military commander of his vegueria (and thus keeper of the publicly owned castles), the chief justice of the same district, and the man in charge of the public finances (the fisc) of the region entrusted to him. As time wore on, the functions of the veguer became more and more judicial in nature. He held a ''cort'' (court) del veguer or de la vegueria with its own seal. The cort had authority in all matter save those relating to the feudal aristocracy. It commonly heard pleas of the crown, civil, and criminal cases. The veguer did, however, retain some military functions as well: he was the commander of the militia and the superintendent of royal castles. His job was law and order and the maintenance of the king's peace: in many respects an office analogous to that of the sheriff in England.\n\nSome of the larger vegueries included one or more sotsvegueries (subvigueries), which had a large degree of autonomy. At the end of the 12th century in Catalonia, there were 12 vegueries. By the end of the reign of Peter the Great (1285) there were 17, and by the time of James the Just, there were 21. After the French annexion of the vegueries of Perpignan and [[Vilafranca de Conflent]] in 1659, Catalonia retained a division of 15 vegueries, 9 sotsvegueries and the special district of the [[Val d'Aran]]. These administrative divisions remained until 1716 when they were replaced by the Castilian ''[[corregimiento]]s''.<ref>The borders of the corregimientos were originally set by the edict of the [[Captain General of Catalonia]] Francisco P\u00edo de Saboya titled:[https://books.google.es/books?id=0l-HcTfkImIC&printsec=frontcover&hl=ca#v=onepage&q&f=false \"''Edicto, que explica la division y confines de los doze corregimientos del Principado de Cathalu\u00f1a y distrito del Valle de Aran con los puntos tocantes a los salarios de los corregidores y de sus tenientes \u00f3 alcaldes mayores.'']\" signed January 2, 1719</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\nAs state under royal sovereignty, Catalonia, like the other political entities of the period, didn't have an own flag or coat of arms in the modern sense. However, a variety of royal and other symbols were used in order to identify the Principality and its institutions.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Flag of Catalonia.svg|150px]]\n| The [[Senyera]] is one of the oldest flags in Europe to be used in present-day (but not in continuous use).

Barcelona: Edicions Ariel, 1964</ref>\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees. From the 8th century, the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards, conquering territories then occupied by Muslims, bringing their language with them.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}} In the 11th century, feudal documents written in [[macaronic Latin]] begin to show Catalan elements. By the end of the 11th century, documents written completely or mostly in Catalan begin to appear, like the Complaints of Guitard Isarn, Lord of Caboet (ca. 1080\u20131095), or The Oath of peace and truce of count Pere Ramon (1098).{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[File:Llibre-dels-Feyts-XXVIIr.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the oldest existing copy of the ''Llibre dels Fets'' written in the original Catalan, dating from 1343. The scene depicts [[James I of Aragon]] with his lords planned the [[conquest of Majorca]] (1229)]]\nCatalan lived a golden age during the Late Middle Ages, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural plenitude, and expanded territorially as more lands were added to the dominions of the Crown of Aragon.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}} Examples of this can be seen in the works of Majorcan [[Ramon Llull]] (1232\u20131315), [[The Four Great Catalan Chronicles]] (13th-14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry which culminated in [[Ausi\u00e0s March]] (1397\u20131459). Catalan became the language of the Kingdom of Majorca, as well the main language of the Kingdom of Valencia, particularly in coastal areas. It was also extended to Sardinia and it was used as an administrative language in Sicily and Athens. Between the 13th and 15th centuries this language was present all over the [[Mediterranean world]], and it was one of the first basis of the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca|Lingua Franca]]<ref>[http://www.uab.cat/Document/439/403/castellanos_linguafranca2007.pdf La \u00ablingua franca\u00bb, una revoluci\u00f3 ling\u00fc\u00edstica mediterr\u00e0nia amb empremta catalana, Carles Castellanos i Lloren\u00e7]</ref>\n\nThe belief that political splendor was correlated with linguistic consolidation was voiced through the Royal Chancery, which promoted a highly standardized language. By the 15th century, the city of [[Valencia]] had become the center of social and cultural dynamism. The novel of chivalry ''[[Tirant lo Blanc]]'' (1490), by [[Joanot Martorell]], shows the transition from medieval to Renaissance values, something than can also be seen in the works of [[Bernat Metge]] and Andreu Febrer. During this period, Catalan remained as one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe. The first book produced with [[movable type]] in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon (1479), the use of Castilian (Spanish) gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the relative decline of the Catalan. Along the 16th and 17 centuries, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the urban and literary classes became largely bilingual. The defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) Spanish replaced Catalan in legal documentation, becoming the administrative and political language in the Principality of Catalonia and kingdoms of Valencia and Majorca.\n\nToday, Catalan is one of the three official languages of [[autonomous community of Catalonia]], as stated in the [[Catalan Statute of Autonomy]]; the other two are Spanish, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] in its [[Aranese]] variety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.gencat.cat/ca/generalitat/estatut/estatut2006/titol_preliminar/|title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6)}}</ref> Catalan has no official recognition in \"[[Northern Catalonia]]\".

Catalonia contributed to further develop the Crown trade and military, most significantly their navy. Catalan language flourished and expanded as more territories were added to the Crown, including [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Athens]], constituting a [[thalassocracy]] across the Mediterranean. The [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crisis of the 14th century]], the end of the rule of [[House of Barcelona]] (1410) and a [[Catalan Civil War|civil war]] (1462\u20131472) weakened the role of the Principality in Crown and international affairs.\n\nThe marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 laid the foundations of the [[Monarchy of Spain]]. In 1492 the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] began, and political power began to shift away towards [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy, alongside the peasants' revolts provoked the [[Reapers' War]] (1640\u20131659). By the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] the Roussillon was ceded to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), the Crown of Aragon supported the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Habsburg]]. After the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713\u201314)|surrender of Barcelona in 1714]], king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V of Bourbon]], inspired by the French model, imposed [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] and a unifying administration across Spain, and enacted the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] for every realm of the Crown of Aragon, which suppressed the main Catalan, Aragonese, Valencian and Majorcan political institutions and rights and merged them into the Crown of Castile as provinces. However, the Principality of Catalonia remained as an administrative unit until the establishment of the Spanish provincial division of 1833, which divided Catalonia into four provinces.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Catalonia}}\n\n===Origins===\nLike much of the Mediterranean coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it was colonized by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who chose to settle in [[Roses, Girona|Roses]].

In 795, [[Charlemagne]] created what came to be known by historiography and some Frankish [[Chronicle|chronicles]] as the [[Marca Hispanica]], a [[buffer zone]] beyond the province of [[Septimania]], made up of locally administered separate [[counties]] which served as a defensive barrier between the [[Umayyad]] of Al-Andalus and the [[Frankish Kingdom]].<ref name=Ramos>{{cite book|last=Ramos|first=Luis G-G|title=Las Invasiones Barbaras en Hispania y la Creaci\u00f3n del Reino Visigodo|year=2002|publisher=Ariel|location=Barcelona|isbn=978-84-344-6668-5|pages=3\u201330}}</ref>\n\nA distinctive Catalan culture started to develop in the [[Middle Ages]] stemming from a number of these small counties throughout the northernmost part of Catalonia. The [[List of Counts of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]] were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the Carolingian emperor then the king of the Franks, to whom they were feudatories (801\u2013988). In 878, [[Wilfred the Hairy]], count of Urgell and Cerdanya, was appointed count of Barcelona, Girona and Osona. Since then, these last three counties were always ruled by the same person, becoming the political core of the future Principality of Catalonia. Upon his death in 897 Wilfred made their titles hereditaries and thus founded the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona]], which ruled Catalonia until the death of Martin I, its last ruling member, in 1410.\n\n[[File:Comtats catalans 1035.svg|thumb|left|200px|The County of Barcelona (in blue-grey) at the death of Ramon Berenguer III (1131)]]\nIn 988 count [[Borrell II]] did not recognise the Frankish king [[Hugh Capet]] and his new dynasty, effectively taking Barcelona out of Frankish rule.<ref>Salrach Josep M\u00aa.

At the start of 11th century the Catalan Counties suffer an important process of feudalisation, as the miles formed links of vassalage over this previously independent peasantry. The middle years of the century were characterized by virulent class warfare. Seigniorial violence was unleashed against the peasants, utilizing new military tactics, based on contracting well armed mercenary soldiers mounted on horses. By the end of the century, most of the aloers had been converted into vassals.<ref>Bisson, Thomas No\u00ebl. Tormented voices.

The terms Catalonia and catalans were commonly used to refer to the territory in Northeastern Spain and western Mediterranean France, as well as its inhabitants, and not just the County of Barcelona, at least since the beginnings of the 12th century, as shown in the earliest recordings of these names in the [[Liber Maiolichinus]] (around 1117\u20131125).\n\nIn 1931, [[republicanism|Republican]] movements favoured its abandonment because it is historically related to the monarchy.\n\nThe name \"Principality of Catalonia\" is abundant in historical documentation that refers to Catalonia between mid-14th century and early 19th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Baydal, Palomo|2020|p=110}}</ref> According to research carried out in recent decades, is considered to be in the second half of the 12th century when the Catalan counties form a unified and cohesive political entity, -although jurisdictionally divided- called \"Catalonia\". This happens because the counts of Barcelona became the one hand, the majority of sovereigns Catalan Counties and the other hand kings of Aragon, which helped them prevail in the rest of autonomous Catalan counts ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], Urgell and [[County of Emp\u00faries|Emp\u00faries]]) if they were not in their feudal vassals, while also incorporated its extensive domain the Islamic territories of [[Tortosa]] and [[Lleida]]. The political entity resulting from this process since the 13th century, was repeatedly mentioned the term \"kingdom\" as a medieval state, i.e. public domain political regime monarchist government.\n\nHowever, it consolidated this denomination officially, because, for various historical reasons, the rulers of the Kingdom of Aragon never use the title \"King of Catalonia.\" This is where comes in the use of the term \"principality\", since at least since the 12th century, the word was synonymous total term \"kingdom\" which alluded generically political entities which categorize [[Historiography|historiographically]] the expression \"Medieval States\". Yet it was not until the 14th century -specifically, since 1350- that, greetings to work of [[Peter III of Aragon]], the Principality of Catalonia became an official and popular name. This political entity was part of some composite monarchies or dynastic conglomerates as the Crown of Aragon, the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of France]] (1641\u20131652), being on an equal footing with other political communities of the time, or external in relation to such great empires, as were the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Valencia, [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] or the [[Duchy of Milan]], for example.<ref>{{harvnb|Baydal, Palomo|2020|p=109}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Nueva Planta decrees of 1716 at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714) and the subsequent dismantling of Catalan institutional system, the territory being annexed to Castile became a province of the new and more unified Kingdom of Bourbon Spain, but \"principality\" continued to be the definition of the territory, as witness the Nueva Planta decrees created the [[Royal Audience of Catalonia (Bourbon)|Royal Audience of the Principality of Catalonia]] in 1716. This situation remained until the Kingdom of Spain was transformed permanently, despite several [[Carlist Wars]], into a liberal state in 1833, when Secretary Javier de Burgos eliminated the province of the Principality of Catalonia, dividing the territory in four provinces that still exist. Thus, the term disappeared from the administrative and political reality of the country.\n\nNeither the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]], [[Spanish Constitution]] nor [[French Constitution]], mention this denomination, but, despite most of them being republican, it is moderately popular among [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]]s and [[Catalan independentism|independentist]]s.\n\n==Government and law==\nThe political system of the Principality of Catalonia and the other realms of the Crown of Aragon has been defined by historyography as \"pactism\".

Yellow and brown territories were lordships without a veguer]]\nThe ''[[vegueria]]'' was a territorial organization of Catalonia headed by a ''veguer'' (Latin: ''vigerius''). The origins of the vegueria go back to the era of the Carolingian Empire, when [[vicars]] (Latin: ''vicarii'', singular ''vicarius'') were installed beneath the counts in the Marca Hispanica. The office of a vicar was a vicariate (Latin: ''vicariatus'') and his territory was a vicaria. All these Latin terms of Carolingian administration evolved in the Catalan language.\n\nThe veguer was appointed by the king and was accountable to him. He was the military commander of his vegueria (and thus keeper of the publicly owned castles), the chief justice of the same district, and the man in charge of the public finances (the fisc) of the region entrusted to him. As time wore on, the functions of the veguer became more and more judicial in nature. He held a ''cort'' (court) del veguer or de la vegueria with its own seal. The cort had authority in all matter save those relating to the feudal aristocracy. It commonly heard pleas of the crown, civil, and criminal cases. The veguer did, however, retain some military functions as well: he was the commander of the militia and the superintendent of royal castles. His job was law and order and the maintenance of the king's peace: in many respects an office analogous to that of the sheriff in England.\n\nSome of the larger vegueries included one or more sotsvegueries (subvigueries), which had a large degree of autonomy. At the end of the 12th century in Catalonia, there were 12 vegueries. By the end of the reign of Peter the Great (1285) there were 17, and by the time of James the Just, there were 21. After the French annexion of the vegueries of Perpignan and [[Vilafranca de Conflent]] in 1659, Catalonia retained a division of 15 vegueries, 9 sotsvegueries and the special district of the [[Val d'Aran]]. These administrative divisions remained until 1716 when they were replaced by the Castilian ''[[corregimiento]]s''.<ref>The borders of the corregimientos were originally set by the edict of the [[Captain General of Catalonia]] Francisco P\u00edo de Saboya titled:[https://books.google.es/books?id=0l-HcTfkImIC&printsec=frontcover&hl=ca#v=onepage&q&f=false \"''Edicto, que explica la division y confines de los doze corregimientos del Principado de Cathalu\u00f1a y distrito del Valle de Aran con los puntos tocantes a los salarios de los corregidores y de sus tenientes \u00f3 alcaldes mayores.'']\" signed January 2, 1719</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\nAs state under royal sovereignty, Catalonia, like the other political entities of the period, didn't have an own flag or coat of arms in the modern sense. However, a variety of royal and other symbols were used in order to identify the Principality and its institutions.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Flag of Catalonia.svg|150px]]\n| The [[Senyera]] is one of the oldest flags in Europe to be used in present-day (but not in continuous use).

Barcelona: Edicions Ariel, 1964</ref>\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees. From the 8th century, the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards, conquering territories then occupied by Muslims, bringing their language with them.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}} In the 11th century, feudal documents written in [[macaronic Latin]] begin to show Catalan elements. By the end of the 11th century, documents written completely or mostly in Catalan begin to appear, like the Complaints of Guitard Isarn, Lord of Caboet (ca. 1080\u20131095), or The Oath of peace and truce of count Pere Ramon (1098).{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[File:Llibre-dels-Feyts-XXVIIr.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the oldest existing copy of the ''Llibre dels Fets'' written in the original Catalan, dating from 1343. The scene depicts [[James I of Aragon]] with his lords planned the [[conquest of Majorca]] (1229)]]\nCatalan lived a golden age during the Late Middle Ages, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural plenitude, and expanded territorially as more lands were added to the dominions of the Crown of Aragon.{{sfn|Costa Carreras|2009|pp=6\u20137}} Examples of this can be seen in the works of Majorcan [[Ramon Llull]] (1232\u20131315), [[The Four Great Catalan Chronicles]] (13th-14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry which culminated in [[Ausi\u00e0s March]] (1397\u20131459). Catalan became the language of the Kingdom of Majorca, as well the main language of the Kingdom of Valencia, particularly in coastal areas. It was also extended to Sardinia and it was used as an administrative language in Sicily and Athens. Between the 13th and 15th centuries this language was present all over the [[Mediterranean world]], and it was one of the first basis of the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca|Lingua Franca]]<ref>[http://www.uab.cat/Document/439/403/castellanos_linguafranca2007.pdf La \u00ablingua franca\u00bb, una revoluci\u00f3 ling\u00fc\u00edstica mediterr\u00e0nia amb empremta catalana, Carles Castellanos i Lloren\u00e7]</ref>\n\nThe belief that political splendor was correlated with linguistic consolidation was voiced through the Royal Chancery, which promoted a highly standardized language. By the 15th century, the city of [[Valencia]] had become the center of social and cultural dynamism. The novel of chivalry ''[[Tirant lo Blanc]]'' (1490), by [[Joanot Martorell]], shows the transition from medieval to Renaissance values, something than can also be seen in the works of [[Bernat Metge]] and Andreu Febrer. During this period, Catalan remained as one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe. The first book produced with [[movable type]] in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon (1479), the use of Castilian (Spanish) gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the relative decline of the Catalan. Along the 16th and 17 centuries, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the urban and literary classes became largely bilingual. The defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) Spanish replaced Catalan in legal documentation, becoming the administrative and political language in the Principality of Catalonia and kingdoms of Valencia and Majorca.\n\nToday, Catalan is one of the three official languages of [[autonomous community of Catalonia]], as stated in the [[Catalan Statute of Autonomy]]; the other two are Spanish, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] in its [[Aranese]] variety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.gencat.cat/ca/generalitat/estatut/estatut2006/titol_preliminar/|title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6)}}</ref> Catalan has no official recognition in \"[[Northern Catalonia]]\".

For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach, even during the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes discovered ways to improve their athletic abilities by boosting testosterone. As their methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that the use of [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete.

American female swimmers, including [[Shirley Babashoff]], accused the [[East Germany at the 1976 Summer Olympics|East Germans]] of using performance-enhancing drugs as early as the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine|last=Brennan |title=Babashoff had Mettle to Speak out about Steroids|date=14 July 2004|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2004-07-15-brennan_x.htm|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>  Babashoff's comments were dismissed by the international and domestic media as sour grapes since Babashoff, a clear favorite to win multiple gold medals, won three silver medals - losing all three times to either of the two East Germans [[Kornelia Ender]] or [[Petra Th\u00fcmer]], and one gold medal in a relay.  There was no suspicion of cheating on the part of the East German female swimmers even though their medal tally increased from four silvers and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] to ten golds (out of a possible 12), six silvers, and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]].  No clear evidence was discovered until after the fall of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall]], when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored drug regimen to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.

about the history of competitors at the [[Olympic Games]] using banned [[ergogenic aid|athletic performance-enhancing drugs]].\n\n== History ==\nThe use of performance-enhancing tactics or more formally known as PEDs, and more broadly, the use of any external device to nefariously influence the outcome of a sporting event has been a part of the Olympics since its inception in Ancient Greece.  One speculation as to why men were required to compete naked was to prevent the use of extra accoutrements and to keep women from competing in events specifically designed for men.<ref name=ancientcheating>{{cite web |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/ancient-greece/first-olympics3.htm|author=Gibson, Candace|title=How the First Olympics Worked|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=2009-01-05}}</ref> Athletes were also known to drink \"magic\" potions and eat exotic meats in the hopes of giving them an athletic edge on their competition.<ref name=ancientdoping>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/pf/63532314.html| title=Ancient Olympics mixed Naked Sports, Pagan Partying| publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2009-01-05|first=Stefan|last=Lovgren}}</ref>  If they were caught cheating, their likenesses were often engraved into stone and placed in a pathway that led to the Olympic stadium.<ref name=ancientcheating/>  In the modern Olympic era, chemically enhancing one's performance has evolved into a sophisticated science, but in the early years of the Modern Olympic movement the use of performance-enhancing drugs was almost as crude as its ancient predecessors. For example, the winner of the [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]], [[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], was given [[strychnine]] and [[brandy]] by his coach, even during the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Hicks|publisher=Sports-reference.com|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/hi/tom-hicks-1.html|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes discovered ways to improve their athletic abilities by boosting testosterone. As their methods became more extreme, it became increasingly evident that the use of [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] was not only a threat to the integrity of sport but could also have potentially fatal side effects on the athlete. The only Olympic death linked to athletic drug use occurred at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Games of 1960]]. During the cycling road race, [[Denmark at the 1960 Summer Olympics|Danish]] cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that he was under the influence of [[amphetamine]], which had caused him to lose consciousness during the race.<ref name=drugdeath>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Anti-Doping|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/dynamic.ch2?pageCategory.id=312|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>  Jensen's death exposed to the world how endemic drug use was among elite athletes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rome 1960|last=Maraniss|first=David|year=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-3407-5|authorlink=David Maraniss|url=https://archive.org/details/rome1960olympics00mara}}</ref>  By the mid\u20131960s, sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and the IOC followed suit in 1967.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sharon|last=Begley|title=The Drug Charade|publisher=Newsweek|date=7 January 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/86079/output/print|accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was [[Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall]], a Swedish [[modern pentathlon|pentathlete]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use, 'two beers to steady his nerves'.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall|publisher=123explore.com |url=http://www.123exp-biographies.com/t/00034345906/|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> Liljenwall was the only athlete to test positive for a banned substance at the 1968 Olympics, as the technology and testing techniques improved, the number of athletes discovered to be chemically enhancing their performance increased as well. \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L1209-0021, Kornelia Ender.jpg|thumb|left|Kornelia Ender]]\nThe most systematic case of drug use for athletic achievement is that of the East German Olympic teams of the 1970s and 1980s.  In 1990, documents were discovered that showed many [[East Germany|East German]] female athletes, especially swimmers, had been administered [[anabolic steroid]]s and other drugs by their coaches and trainers. Girls as young as eleven were started on the drug regimen without consent from their parents. American female swimmers, including [[Shirley Babashoff]], accused the [[East Germany at the 1976 Summer Olympics|East Germans]] of using performance-enhancing drugs as early as the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine|last=Brennan |title=Babashoff had Mettle to Speak out about Steroids|date=14 July 2004|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2004-07-15-brennan_x.htm|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>  Babashoff's comments were dismissed by the international and domestic media as sour grapes since Babashoff, a clear favorite to win multiple gold medals, won three silver medals - losing all three times to either of the two East Germans [[Kornelia Ender]] or [[Petra Th\u00fcmer]], and one gold medal in a relay.  There was no suspicion of cheating on the part of the East German female swimmers even though their medal tally increased from four silvers and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] to ten golds (out of a possible 12), six silvers, and one bronze in [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]].  No clear evidence was discovered until after the fall of the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall]], when the aforementioned documents proved that East Germany had embarked on a state-sponsored drug regimen to dramatically improve their competitiveness at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events. Many of the East German authorities responsible for this program have been subsequently tried and found guilty of various crimes in the German penal system.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jere|last=Longman|title=Just Following Orders, Doctors' Orders|publisher=The New York Times|date=22 April 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/sports/just-following-orders-doctors-orders.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref><ref name=DeutscheWelle>{{cite web |title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=26 February 2006|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".<ref name=DG2011>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}</ref> On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

His gold medal was subsequently stripped and awarded to runner-up [[Carl Lewis]], who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics, but had not been banned due to a lack of consistency in the application of the rules.  At that time National Olympic Committees had leeway to determine whether a specific athlete met the criteria to be banned from Olympic competition.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacquelin|last=Magnay|title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html|date=18 April 2003|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==Response==\nIn the late 1990s, the IOC took the initiative in a more organized battle against doping, leading to the formation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) in 1999.

During the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the \"Olympic Standard\") has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Zachary|last=Coile|title=Bill Seeks to Toughen Drug Testing in Pro Sports|date=27 April 2005|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/04/27/MNGMICG0SS1.DTL|accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> During the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing games]], 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Russia#Background: Soviet era}}\nThough no athletes were caught doping at the 1980 Summer Olympics, it has been revealed that athletes had begun using [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] and other drugs for which tests had not been yet developed. A 1989 report by a committee of the [[Australian Senate]] claimed that \"there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists' Games\".<ref name=\"Hunt2007\"/>\n\nA member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to [[epitestosterone]] in [[urine]]. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official.<ref name=\"Hunt2007\"/> The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.<ref name=\"D.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, was assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Inside the city, Massey adopted spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight on 12 August a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger morning raid on the green resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on the green, in which he placed the largest of Royalist's eight pieces of artillery, two 24-pounder cannon, along with a 12-pounder. The remaining artillery was positioned in two emplacements to the east.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref>\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, had assembled around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> The King's demand for its surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Inside the city, Massey adopted spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight on 12 August a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger morning raid on the green resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on the green, in which he placed the largest of Royalist's eight pieces of artillery, two 24-pounder cannon, along with a 12-pounder. The remaining artillery was positioned in two emplacements to the east.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref>\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.
