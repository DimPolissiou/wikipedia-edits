The show revolves around a fraternity of five monsters who unleash wild stunts upon the public from their eponymous mountain fort. The series is loosely based on the antagonists that appeared in Browngardt's animated short, ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'', and employs Mike Conte of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Early Man (band)|Early Man]] as composer. \nThe show premiered as a sneak peek on Cartoon Network on August 1, 2011, and had a formal premiere September 26, 2011.\nThe show has been well received, and designers [[Robertryan Cory]] and [[Chris Tsirgiotis]] both won awards for \"Outstanding Individual in Animation\" at the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]] ceremony.\nThe ''Uncle Grandpa'' short that Browngardt had produced was eventually adapted as a full [[Uncle Grandpa|series of the same name]], which he felt was a more lighthearted adaptation for children.\n\nThe series last aired on television on February 17, 2012, with the remaining episodes being released on [[iTunes]] between March 8\u201329, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Secret Mountain Fort Awesome promotional image.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show; clockwise from left: Slog, Festro, the Fart, Dingle and Gweelok|alt=The five main monsters of the series, shown together in their living room, facing the viewer]]\nA fivesome of monsters known as the Disgustoids are banished from society due to their unruly behavior and grotesque appearances.\nFrom their sentient and eponymous mountain fort, they unleash crazy stunts on the public.\nTheir leader, a purple, tusked creature named Festro (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]]), is a macho party animal willing to do anything to help out his group, even when his help is less than desired.\nDingle (also voiced by Browngardt), scrawny and blue, acts as their faithful pet, intelligible only to the group.\nSlog (voiced by [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]]), a black-furred monster, is likewise blindly loyal, but lacks critical judgement skills\u2014the more hazardous something is, the more likely he will be to follow it.\nGweelok (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]), an acned green ball, has a demanding attitude and an obsession with technology.\nThe Fart (voiced by Pat Duke), a monster made of buttocks who flatulates when touched\u2014is the most sensitive and levelheaded of the group.\n\n==Production==\nAt their 2011 [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]], [[Cartoon Network]] announced ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'', along with various other series.{{Sfn|Andreeva|2011}} Billed as a comedy,{{Sfn|TV Guide (a)}} the show was created by [[Peter Browngardt|Browngardt]] and based on his animated short ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'',{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} which garnered praise, a cult following and an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Zahed|1y=2011|1p=45|2a1=Television Academy}}\nBoth were produced at [[Cartoon Network Studios]].{{Sfn|Milligan|2011}} Before landing his own show, Browngardt had worked at [[Augenblick Studios]] and [[MTV]], as well as on individual programs, such as ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' and ''[[Chowder (TV series)|Chowder]]''. Browngardt's work on the lattermost series began when its creator [[C.H. Greenblatt]] looked through one of his pitch bibles that he left at the studio.{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}}\n\nThe show borrows elements and its design style from his ''Uncle Grandpa'' short, which was pitched to the network as a pilot. According to Browngardt, Cartoon Network executives were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer [[Robertryan Cory]] and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'') were brought on board to help shape the project's development.\n\nIn an interview with [[Cartoon Brew]], Browngardt called the process of pitching his pilot an \"amazing learning experience\" because it allowed him to propose an idea to the network and see \"how it can manipulate and change while you're working on it\".{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} On the show, animation veteran [[Chris Reccardi]] served as [[creative director]], whilst Sue Mondt (who had previously art directed Cartoon Network's ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'') handled [[Art director|art direction]] and [[Robert Alvarez]] with [[Larry Leichliter]] directed the [[Animation director|animation]].{{Sfn|Turner Broadcasting System|2011\u201312}} Browngardt depicted the production schedule as \"really tight\", which called for them to manage their time and to pick their battles with the network.{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}}\n\nIn the United States, the show is rated [[TV-PG]].{{Sfn|TV Guide (a)}} Referring to his encounters with the network regarding content, Browngardt learned to let go and find the \"right balance\", as well as to ask himself, \"Is my grandma going to notice this?\"{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}} For the music, Mike Conte of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Early Man (band)|Early Man]] was employed as composer. The score, which incorporates heavy metal elements and \"lots of [[wikt:riffage|riffage]]\",{{Sfn|Neilstein|2011}} was originally added to the [[animatics]] as a [[Temp track|rough draft]]. Browngardt found that it harmonized with the imagery and what he envisioned for the design.{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} Conte noted Browngardt's inspirations from ''[[Garbage Pail Kids]]'' and [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]] of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, but called the result \"definitely its own thing\".{{Sfn|Neilstein|2011}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters}}\n*[[Peter Browngardt]]\n*Pat Duke\n*Steve Little\n*Paul Rugg\n*Clive Revill\n*Grey Griffin\n*Pat Fraley\n*Tom Kenny\n*Donald Gibb\n*Heather Halley\n*Andy Merrill\n*David P. Smith\n*Dee Bradley Baker\n*Mark Bodnar\n*Dee Snider\n*Kath Soucie\n*Steve Blum\n*Brook Chalmers\n*Valery Pappas\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n''Secret Mountain'' premiered on August 1, 2011 on [[Cartoon Network]] as part of a sneak preview;{{Sfn|Constant Contact|2011}} this broadcast was seen by 1.8 million viewers.{{Sfn|The Futon Critic|2011a}} It premiered formally on September 26 as part of their Monday night programming block,{{Sfn|Milligan|2011}} where it was seen by 1.3 million viewers, marking a slight decrease from the previous broadcast.{{Sfn|The Futon Critic|2011b}} The show was moved to Fridays upon its second-season premiere on December 30, 2011.{{Sfn|TV Guide (b)}} Following the premiere of the eighth episode of the season on February 17, 2012, the show was pulled from broadcast. The network released the remaining eight episodes through [[iTunes]] a month later, from March 8 to March 29, thus concluding the show.{{Sfn|iTunes Store|}}\n\nMany critics were complimentary in regards to the series' art style. In his website ''Lineboil'', [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]] compared it to ''[[Garbage Pail Kids]]'' and the works of [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], two elements of his childhood.{{Sfn|Simpson|2011}} Amid Amidi of ''[[Cartoon Brew]]'' called [[Robertryan Cory]]'s character designs \"impressive\" and \"distinctively styled\", though he felt the art style's complexity made the limited animation quality suffer as a result.{{Sfn|Amidi|2011}} Abby Koenig of ''[[Houston Press]]'' compared its \"ridiculous\" nature to the film ''[[Little Monsters]]'', and proposed that [[Howie Mandel]] (featured in the latter work) guest voice a monster on the show.{{Sfn|Koenig|2012}} Shannon O'Leary of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote that the show, along with others on the network such as ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and ''[[Superjail!]]'', bore resemblance to the aesthetics of established [[independent comic]]s artists.{{Sfn|O'Leary|2012}} Meanwhile, Jason Krell of ''[[io9]]'' considered it a failure despite its influences from ''Adventure Time'', which made way for many successful original series on the network.{{Sfn|Krell|2014}} Although, some people said it was Cartoon Network's attempt to copy [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'', as both shows are cartoons about monsters.\n\nThe episode \"Nightmare Sauce\" received multiple accolades, including at the 2012 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] for \"Best TV Production\" (of which Browngardt was the recipient{{Sfn|Annecy International Animated Film Festival|}}), and at the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]], where Cory and [[Chris Tsirgiotis]] were awarded \"Outstanding Individual in Animation\".{{Sfn|Television Academy|2012|p=10}} Cory also won at the [[39th Annie Awards]] for \"Character Design in a Television Production\", while Tsirgiotis, Sue Mondt, Daniel Elson and Mark Bodnar were collectively awarded \"Production Design in a Television Production\".{{Sfn|Annie Awards|2011|pp=16, 39}} At the [[40th Annie Awards]], Thaddeus Paul Couldron was nominated for \"Character Design in an Animated Television or Other Broadcast Venue Production\" for his work on the episode \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\".{{Sfn|Annie Awards|2013}}\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = #7dc727\n| link1     = <includeonly>Secret Mountain Fort Awesome</includeonly>#Season 1 (2011)\n| episodes1 = 10\n| start1    = {{Start date|2011|8|1}}\n| end1      = {{End date|2011|12|16}}\n| network1  = [[Cartoon Network]]\n\n| link2      = <includeonly>Secret Mountain Fort Awesome</includeonly>#Season 2 (2011-12)\n| episodes2  = 16\n| color2     = #11b2d5\n| episodes2A = 8\n| start2A    = {{Start date|2011|12|30}}\n| end2A      = {{End date|2012|2|17}}\n| episodes2B = 8\n| start2B    = {{Start date|2012|3|8}}\n| end2B      = {{End date|2012|3|29}}\n| network2B  = [[iTunes]]\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (2011)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|+ ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' season 1 episodes\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Title\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Written and storyboarded by\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Story by\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Original air date\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Prod.<br />code\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | U.S. viewers<br />{{small|(in millions)}}\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Teleport-A-Potty\n |WrittenBy=Audie Harrison\n |Aux2=Dave Tennant, Fred Belford, [[Pete Browngardt]], and David P.

The show revolves around a fraternity of five monsters who unleash wild stunts upon the public from their eponymous mountain fort. The series is loosely based on the antagonists that appeared in Browngardt's animated short, ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'', and employs Mike Conte of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Early Man (band)|Early Man]] as composer. \nThe show premiered as a sneak peek on Cartoon Network on August 1, 2011, and had a formal premiere September 26, 2011.\nThe show has been well received, and designers [[Robertryan Cory]] and [[Chris Tsirgiotis]] both won awards for \"Outstanding Individual in Animation\" at the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]] ceremony.\nThe ''Uncle Grandpa'' short that Browngardt had produced was eventually adapted as a full [[Uncle Grandpa|series of the same name]], which he felt was a more lighthearted adaptation for children.\n\nThe series last aired on television on February 17, 2012, with the remaining episodes being released on [[iTunes]] between March 8\u201329, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Secret Mountain Fort Awesome promotional image.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show; clockwise from left: Slog, Festro, the Fart, Dingle and Gweelok|alt=The five main monsters of the series, shown together in their living room, facing the viewer]]\nA fivesome of monsters known as the Disgustoids are banished from society due to their unruly behavior and grotesque appearances.\nFrom their sentient and eponymous mountain fort, they unleash crazy stunts on the public.\nTheir leader, a purple, tusked creature named Festro (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]]), is a macho party animal willing to do anything to help out his group, even when his help is less than desired.\nDingle (also voiced by Browngardt), scrawny and blue, acts as their faithful pet, intelligible only to the group.\nSlog (voiced by [[Steve Little (actor)|Steve Little]]), a black-furred monster, is likewise blindly loyal, but lacks critical judgement skills\u2014the more hazardous something is, the more likely he will be to follow it.\nGweelok (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]), an acned green ball, has a demanding attitude and an obsession with technology.\nThe Fart (voiced by Pat Duke), a monster made of buttocks who flatulates when touched\u2014is the most sensitive and levelheaded of the group.\n\n==Production==\nAt their 2011 [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]], [[Cartoon Network]] announced ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'', along with various other series.{{Sfn|Andreeva|2011}} Billed as a comedy,{{Sfn|TV Guide (a)}} the show was created by [[Peter Browngardt|Browngardt]] and based on his animated short ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'',{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} which garnered praise, a cult following and an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Zahed|1y=2011|1p=45|2a1=Television Academy}}\nBoth were produced at [[Cartoon Network Studios]].{{Sfn|Milligan|2011}} Before landing his own show, Browngardt had worked at [[Augenblick Studios]] and [[MTV]], as well as on individual programs, such as ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' and ''[[Chowder (TV series)|Chowder]]''. Browngardt's work on the lattermost series began when its creator [[C.H. Greenblatt]] looked through one of his pitch bibles that he left at the studio.{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}}\n\nThe show borrows elements and its design style from his ''Uncle Grandpa'' short, which was pitched to the network as a pilot. According to Browngardt, Cartoon Network executives were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer [[Robertryan Cory]] and David P. Smith (a director and storyboard artist on ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'') were brought on board to help shape the project's development.\n\nIn an interview with [[Cartoon Brew]], Browngardt called the process of pitching his pilot an \"amazing learning experience\" because it allowed him to propose an idea to the network and see \"how it can manipulate and change while you're working on it\".{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} On the show, animation veteran [[Chris Reccardi]] served as [[creative director]], whilst Sue Mondt (who had previously art directed Cartoon Network's ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'') handled [[Art director|art direction]] and [[Robert Alvarez]] with [[Larry Leichliter]] directed the [[Animation director|animation]].{{Sfn|Turner Broadcasting System|2011\u201312}} Browngardt depicted the production schedule as \"really tight\", which called for them to manage their time and to pick their battles with the network.{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}}\n\nIn the United States, the show is rated [[TV-PG]].{{Sfn|TV Guide (a)}} Referring to his encounters with the network regarding content, Browngardt learned to let go and find the \"right balance\", as well as to ask himself, \"Is my grandma going to notice this?\"{{Sfn|Zahed|2011|p=45}} For the music, Mike Conte of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Early Man (band)|Early Man]] was employed as composer. The score, which incorporates heavy metal elements and \"lots of [[wikt:riffage|riffage]]\",{{Sfn|Neilstein|2011}} was originally added to the [[animatics]] as a [[Temp track|rough draft]]. Browngardt found that it harmonized with the imagery and what he envisioned for the design.{{Sfn|Amidi|2013}} Conte noted Browngardt's inspirations from ''[[Garbage Pail Kids]]'' and [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]] of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, but called the result \"definitely its own thing\".{{Sfn|Neilstein|2011}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Peter Browngardt]]\n*Pat Duke\n*Steve Little\n*Paul Rugg\n*Clive Revill\n*Grey Griffin\n*Pat Fraley\n*Tom Kenny\n*Donald Gibb\n*Heather Halley\n*Andy Merrill\n*David P. Smith\n*Dee Bradley Baker\n*Mark Bodnar\n*Dee Snider\n*Kath Soucie\n*Steve Blum\n*Brook Chalmers\n*Valery Pappas\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n''Secret Mountain'' premiered on August 1, 2011 on [[Cartoon Network]] as part of a sneak preview;{{Sfn|Constant Contact|2011}} this broadcast was seen by 1.8 million viewers.{{Sfn|The Futon Critic|2011a}} It premiered formally on September 26 as part of their Monday night programming block,{{Sfn|Milligan|2011}} where it was seen by 1.3 million viewers, marking a slight decrease from the previous broadcast.{{Sfn|The Futon Critic|2011b}} The show was moved to Fridays upon its second-season premiere on December 30, 2011.{{Sfn|TV Guide (b)}} Following the premiere of the eighth episode of the season on February 17, 2012, the show was pulled from broadcast. The network released the remaining eight episodes through [[iTunes]] a month later, from March 8 to March 29, thus concluding the show.{{Sfn|iTunes Store|}}\n\nMany critics were complimentary in regards to the series' art style. In his website ''Lineboil'', [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]] compared it to ''[[Garbage Pail Kids]]'' and the works of [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], two elements of his childhood.{{Sfn|Simpson|2011}} Amid Amidi of ''[[Cartoon Brew]]'' called [[Robertryan Cory]]'s character designs \"impressive\" and \"distinctively styled\", though he felt the art style's complexity made the limited animation quality suffer as a result.{{Sfn|Amidi|2011}} Abby Koenig of ''[[Houston Press]]'' compared its \"ridiculous\" nature to the film ''[[Little Monsters]]'', and proposed that [[Howie Mandel]] (featured in the latter work) guest voice a monster on the show.{{Sfn|Koenig|2012}} Shannon O'Leary of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote that the show, along with others on the network such as ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and ''[[Superjail!]]'', bore resemblance to the aesthetics of established [[independent comic]]s artists.{{Sfn|O'Leary|2012}} Meanwhile, Jason Krell of ''[[io9]]'' considered it a failure despite its influences from ''Adventure Time'', which made way for many successful original series on the network.{{Sfn|Krell|2014}} Although, some people said it was Cartoon Network's attempt to copy [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'', as both shows are cartoons about monsters.\n\nThe episode \"Nightmare Sauce\" received multiple accolades, including at the 2012 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] for \"Best TV Production\" (of which Browngardt was the recipient{{Sfn|Annecy International Animated Film Festival|}}), and at the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]], where Cory and [[Chris Tsirgiotis]] were awarded \"Outstanding Individual in Animation\".{{Sfn|Television Academy|2012|p=10}} Cory also won at the [[39th Annie Awards]] for \"Character Design in a Television Production\", while Tsirgiotis, Sue Mondt, Daniel Elson and Mark Bodnar were collectively awarded \"Production Design in a Television Production\".{{Sfn|Annie Awards|2011|pp=16, 39}} At the [[40th Annie Awards]], Thaddeus Paul Couldron was nominated for \"Character Design in an Animated Television or Other Broadcast Venue Production\" for his work on the episode \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\".{{Sfn|Annie Awards|2013}}\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = #7dc727\n| link1     = <includeonly>Secret Mountain Fort Awesome</includeonly>#Season 1 (2011)\n| episodes1 = 10\n| start1    = {{Start date|2011|8|1}}\n| end1      = {{End date|2011|12|16}}\n| network1  = [[Cartoon Network]]\n\n| link2      = <includeonly>Secret Mountain Fort Awesome</includeonly>#Season 2 (2011-12)\n| episodes2  = 16\n| color2     = #11b2d5\n| episodes2A = 8\n| start2A    = {{Start date|2011|12|30}}\n| end2A      = {{End date|2012|2|17}}\n| episodes2B = 8\n| start2B    = {{Start date|2012|3|8}}\n| end2B      = {{End date|2012|3|29}}\n| network2B  = [[iTunes]]\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (2011)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|+ ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' season 1 episodes\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Title\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Written and storyboarded by\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Story by\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Original air date\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | Prod.<br />code\n! style=\"background-color: #7dc727;\" | U.S. viewers<br />{{small|(in millions)}}\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Teleport-A-Potty\n |WrittenBy=Audie Harrison\n |Aux2=Dave Tennant, Fred Belford, [[Pete Browngardt]], and David P.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

[[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] and [[IBM BS12]] followed.\n\t\nThe most common definition of an RDBMS is a product that presents a view of data as a collection of rows and columns, even if it is not based strictly upon [[Relational model|relational theory]]. By this definition, RDBMS products typically implement some but not all of Codd's 12 rules.\n\nA second school of thought argues that if a database does not implement all of Codd's rules (or the current understanding on the relational model, as expressed by [[Christopher J. Date]], [[Hugh Darwen]] and others), it is not relational. This view, shared by many theorists and other strict adherents to Codd's principles, would disqualify most DBMSs as not relational. For clarification, they often refer to some RDBMSs as ''truly-relational database management systems'' (TRDBMS), naming others ''pseudo-relational database management systems'' (PRDBMS). <!-- It can also be said as the raw database management system.-->\n\nAs of 2009, most commercial relational DBMSs employ [[SQL]] as their [[query language]].<ref>{{cite journal | title= SRQL: Sorted Relational Query Language| last= Ramakrishnan |first=Raghu| last2=  Donjerkovic| first2=Donko| last3= Ranganathan |first3=Arvind | last4=  Beyer|first4=Kevin S.| last5= Krishnaprasad | first5=Muralidhar | journal = e Proceedings of SSDBM| year= 1998| url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~beyer/papers/srql_ssdbm98.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAlternative query languages have been proposed and implemented, notably the pre-1996 implementation of [[QUEL query languages|Ingres QUEL]].\n\n==Relational model==\n{{main|Relational model}}\nThis model organizes data into one or more [[table (database)|tables]] (or \"relations\") of [[Column (database)|columns]] and [[row (database)|rows]], with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called [[Record (computer science)|records]] or [[tuple]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/overview/database.html|title=A Relational Database Overview|website=oracle.com}}</ref> Columns are also called attributes. Generally, each table/relation represents one \"entity type\" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as \"Lee\" or \"chair\") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).\n\n== Keys ==\n\nEach row in a table has its own unique key. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as [[foreign key]]s). Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPart of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table. Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique [[primary key]] (PK) for each row in a table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs. Other, more [[natural key]]s may also be identified and defined as [[alternate key]]s (AK). Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK). Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table. Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world, a [[globally unique identifier]], when there are broader system requirements.\n\nThe primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table. When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a [[One-to-one (data model)|one-to-one]] or [[One-to-many (data model)|one-to-many]] relationship. Most relational database designs resolve [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables\u2014the relationship becomes an entity; the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there is usually neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.\n\n=== Relationships ===\nRelationships are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.\n\n== Transactions ==\nIn order for a database management system (DBMS) to operate efficiently and accurately, it must use [[ACID transactions]].<ref>{{\ncite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1998/11-23gray.mspx\n|title=Gray to be Honored With A.

Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system. For increased security, the system design may grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables. Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new and update existing data. More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Image:Relational database terms.svg|350px|thumb|right|Relational database terminology.]]\nThe relational database was first defined in June 1970 by [[Edgar F.

A relational database has become the predominant type of database.  Other models besides the ''relational model'' include the [[hierarchical database model]] and the [[network model]].\n\nThe table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and the corresponding [[SQL]] term:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! SQL term\n! Relational database term\n! Description\n|-\n| [[Row (database)|'''''Row''''']]\n| '''''[[Tuple]]''''' or [[Record (computer science)|'''''record''''']]\n| A data set representing a single item\n|-\n| [[Column (database)|'''''Column''''']]\n| '''''Attribute''''' or '''''field'''''\n| A labeled element of a tuple, e.g. \"Address\" or \"Date of birth\"\n|- \n| [[Table (database)|'''''Table''''']]\n| [[Relation (database)|'''''Relation''''']] or [[relvar|'''''Base relvar''''']]\n| A set of tuples sharing the same attributes; a set of columns and rows\n|-\n| [[View (SQL)|'''''View''''']] or '''''[[result set]]'''''\n| '''''Derived relvar'''''\n| Any set of tuples; a data report from the RDBMS in response to a [[query language|query]]\n|}\n\n==Relations or tables==\n{{main|Relation (database)|Table (database)}}\nA ''[[relation (database)|relation]]'' is defined as a set of [[tuple]]s that have the same [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]]. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a [[Table (database)|table]], which is organized into [[Row (database)|rows]] and [[Column (database)|columns]]. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] and conform to the same constraints.\n\nThe relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples, in turn, impose no order on the attributes. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as ''select'' to identify tuples, ''project'' to identify attributes, and ''join'' to combine relations. Relations can be modified using the ''insert'', ''delete'', and ''update'' operators. New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query. Similarly, queries identify tuples for updating or deleting.\n\nTuples by definition are unique. If the tuple contains a [[candidate key|candidate]] or primary key then obviously it is unique; however, a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple. The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique, but does not require a primary key to be defined. Because a tuple is unique, its attributes by definition constitute a [[superkey]].\n\n==Base and derived relations==<!-- This section is linked from Relational database -->\n{{main|Relvar|View (database)}}\nIn a relational database, all data are stored and accessed via [[relation (database)|relations]]. Relations that store data are called \"base relations\", and in implementations are called \"tables\". Other relations do not store data, but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations. These relations are sometimes called \"derived relations\". In implementations these are called \"[[View (database)|views]]\" or \"queries\". Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation, even though they may grab information from several relations. Also, derived relations can be used as an [[abstraction layer]].\n\n===Domain===\n{{main|data domain}}\nA domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set.\nThe character string ''\"ABC\"'', for instance, is not in the integer domain, but the integer value ''123'' is. Another example of domain describes the possible values for the field \"CoinFace\" as (\"Heads\",\"Tails\"). So, the field \"CoinFace\" will not accept input values like (0,1) or (H,T).\n\n==Constraints==\nConstraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing [[business rules]] in the database and support subsequent data use within the application layer. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of [[check constraint]]s.\nConstraints restrict the data that can be stored in [[relation (database)|relations]]. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a <!-- do not change the capitalization of this link without first consulting, and replying to the talk page. Any such edits will be reverted. -->[[Boolean data type|boolean]] value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations of attributes) or to an entire relation.\nSince every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints ('''domain constraints'''). The two principal rules for the relational model are known as '''entity integrity''' and '''referential integrity'''.\n\nReferential integrity is based on the simple concept of relational vector based analytic algorithms, commonly employed in cloud platforms. This enables multiple interface processing within the referential database, with the additional feature of adding an additional security layer over the dynamically defined virtual environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wiese |first1=Lena |title=Advanced data management: for SQL, noSQL, cloud and distributed databases |date=2015 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Primary key===\n{{main|Unique key|Primary key}}\nEach [[Relation (database)|relation]]/table has a primary key, this being a consequence of a relation being a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].{{Sfnp|Date|1984|268}}  A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table.  While natural attributes (attributes used to describe the data being entered) are sometimes good primary keys, [[surrogate key]]s are often used instead. A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it (for instance, in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them). The surrogate key has no intrinsic (inherent) meaning, but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple.\nAnother common occurrence, especially in regard to N:M cardinality is the [[Compound key|composite key]]. A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that (together) uniquely identify a record.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Foreign key===\n{{main|Foreign key}}\nA foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table. It relates the two keys. Foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation.  A foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables, and it effectively uses the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation.  The concept is described formally as: \"For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes, there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes.\"\n\n===Stored procedures===\n{{main|Stored procedure}}\nA stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database. Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations, like inserting a [[tuple]] into a [[relation (database)|relation]], gathering statistical information about usage patterns, or encapsulating complex [[business logic]] and calculations. Frequently they are used as an [[application programming interface]] (API) for security or simplicity. Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMS's often allow developers to take advantage of [[Procedural programming|procedural]] extensions (often vendor-specific) to the standard [[Declarative programming|declarative]] SQL syntax.\nStored procedures are not part of the relational database model, but all commercial implementations include them.\n\n===Index===\n{{main|Index (database)}}\nAn index is one way of providing quicker access to data. Indexes can be created on any combination of attributes on a [[relation (database)|relation]]. Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the index, without having to check each tuple in turn. This is analogous to using the [[Index (publishing)|index of a book]] to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found, so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for. Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques, each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution, relation size, and typical access pattern. Indices are usually implemented via [[B+ tree]]s, [[R-tree]]s, and [[Bitmap index|bitmaps]].\nIndices are usually not considered part of the database, as they are considered an implementation detail, though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database. The use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance. This is because B-tree indexes result in query times proportional to log(n) where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries (no size dependency as long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory).\n\n==Relational operations==\n{{main|Relational algebra}}\nQueries made against the relational database, and the derived [[relvars]] in the database are expressed in a [[relational calculus]] or a [[relational algebra]]. In his original relational algebra, Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each. The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical [[Set theory|set operations]]:\n* The [[Union (set theory)|union]] operator combines the tuples of two [[relation (database)|relations]] and removes all duplicate tuples from the result. The relational union operator is equivalent to the [[Union (SQL)|SQL UNION]] operator.\n* The [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] operator produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common. Intersection is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Intersect (SQL)|INTERSECT]] operator.\n* The [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] operator acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation. Difference is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Except (SQL)|EXCEPT]] or MINUS operator.\n* The [[cartesian product]] of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria, resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation. The cartesian product is implemented in SQL as the [[Cross join]] operator.\nThe remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases:\n* The selection, or restriction, operation retrieves tuples from a relation, limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criterion, i.e. a [[subset]] in terms of set theory. The SQL equivalent of selection is the [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]] query statement with a [[Where (SQL)|WHERE]] clause.\n* The [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection operation]] extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples.\n* The join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join. In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes. MySQL's approximation of a natural join is the [[Inner join]] operator. In SQL, an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query. For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product. Thus, for N tables in an SQL query, there must be N\u22121 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product.\n* The [[Relational algebra#Division|relational division]] operation is a slightly more complex operation and essentially involves using the tuples of one relation (the dividend) to partition a second relation (the divisor). The relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator (hence the name).\nOther operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd's introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data, among others.\n\n==Normalization==\n{{main|Database normalization}}\nNormalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model. It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate non-simple domains (non-atomic values) and the redundancy (duplication) of data, which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity.  The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the [[Database normalization#Normal forms|normal forms]].\n\n==RDBMS==\n[[File:RDBMS structure.png|thumbnail|right|The general structure of a relational database.]]\n{{See also|Database#Database management system}}\nConnolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\".<ref name=\"Begg-p64\">{{cite book|last1=Connolly|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Begg| first2=Carolyn E.|date=2014|title= Database Systems \u2013 A Practical Approach to Design Implementation and Management|edition=6th|isbn=978-1292061184|publisher=Pearson|page=64 }}</ref>  RDBMS is an extension of that acronym that is sometimes used when the underlying database is relational.\n\nAn alternative definition for a ''relational database management system'' is a database management system (DBMS) based on the [[relational model]].

Relational databases have often replaced legacy [[hierarchical database]]s and [[network database]]s, because RDBMS were easier to implements and administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued, unsuccessful challenges by [[object database]] management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called [[object-relational impedance mismatch]] between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by [[XML database]] management systems in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as [[horizontal scaling]] of [[computer cluster]]s, [[NoSQL]] databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/nosql-databases-eat-into-the-relational-database-market|access-date=2018-03-14|title=NoSQL databases eat into the relational database market}}</ref>\n\n==Distributed relational databases==\n\n[[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994.

[[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] and [[IBM BS12]] followed.\n\t\nThe most common definition of an RDBMS is a product that presents a view of data as a collection of rows and columns, even if it is not based strictly upon [[Relational model|relational theory]]. By this definition, RDBMS products typically implement some but not all of Codd's 12 rules.\n\nA second school of thought argues that if a database does not implement all of Codd's rules (or the current understanding on the relational model, as expressed by [[Christopher J. Date]], [[Hugh Darwen]] and others), it is not relational. This view, shared by many theorists and other strict adherents to Codd's principles, would disqualify most DBMSs as not relational. For clarification, they often refer to some RDBMSs as ''truly-relational database management systems'' (TRDBMS), naming others ''pseudo-relational database management systems'' (PRDBMS). <!-- It can also be said as the raw database management system.-->\n\nAs of 2009, most commercial relational DBMSs employ [[SQL]] as their [[query language]].<ref>{{cite journal | title= SRQL: Sorted Relational Query Language| last= Ramakrishnan |first=Raghu| last2=  Donjerkovic| first2=Donko| last3= Ranganathan |first3=Arvind | last4=  Beyer|first4=Kevin S.| last5= Krishnaprasad | first5=Muralidhar | journal = e Proceedings of SSDBM| year= 1998| url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~beyer/papers/srql_ssdbm98.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAlternative query languages have been proposed and implemented, notably the pre-1996 implementation of [[QUEL query languages|Ingres QUEL]].\n\n==Relational model==\n{{main|Relational model}}\nThis model organizes data into one or more [[table (database)|tables]] (or \"relations\") of [[Column (database)|columns]] and [[row (database)|rows]], with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called [[Record (computer science)|records]] or [[tuple]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/overview/database.html|title=A Relational Database Overview|website=oracle.com}}</ref> Columns are also called attributes. Generally, each table/relation represents one \"entity type\" (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as \"Lee\" or \"chair\") and the columns representing values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).\n\n== Keys ==\n\nEach row in a table has its own unique key. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as [[foreign key]]s). Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nPart of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table. Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique [[primary key]] (PK) for each row in a table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs. Other, more [[natural key]]s may also be identified and defined as [[alternate key]]s (AK). Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK). Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table. Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world, a [[globally unique identifier]], when there are broader system requirements.\n\nThe primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in the other table. When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a [[One-to-one (data model)|one-to-one]] or [[One-to-many (data model)|one-to-many]] relationship. Most relational database designs resolve [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]] relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables\u2014the relationship becomes an entity; the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there is usually neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.\n\n=== Relationships ===\nRelationships are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.\n\n== Transactions ==\nIn order for a database management system (DBMS) to operate efficiently and accurately, it must use [[ACID transactions]].<ref>{{\ncite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1998/11-23gray.mspx\n|title=Gray to be Honored With A.

Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system. For increased security, the system design may grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables. Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new and update existing data. More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Image:Relational database terms.svg|350px|thumb|right|Relational database terminology.]]\nThe relational database was first defined in June 1970 by [[Edgar F.

A relational database has become the predominant type of database.  Other models besides the ''relational model'' include the [[hierarchical database model]] and the [[network model]].\n\nThe table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and the corresponding [[SQL]] term:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! SQL term\n! Relational database term\n! Description\n|-\n| [[Row (database)|'''''Row''''']]\n| '''''[[Tuple]]''''' or [[Record (computer science)|'''''record''''']]\n| A data set representing a single item\n|-\n| [[Column (database)|'''''Column''''']]\n| '''''Attribute''''' or '''''field'''''\n| A labeled element of a tuple, e.g. \"Address\" or \"Date of birth\"\n|- \n| [[Table (database)|'''''Table''''']]\n| [[Relation (database)|'''''Relation''''']] or [[relvar|'''''Base relvar''''']]\n| A set of tuples sharing the same attributes; a set of columns and rows\n|-\n| [[View (SQL)|'''''View''''']] or '''''[[result set]]'''''\n| '''''Derived relvar'''''\n| Any set of tuples; a data report from the RDBMS in response to a [[query language|query]]\n|}\n\n==Relations or tables==\n{{main|Relation (database)|Table (database)}}\nA ''[[relation (database)|relation]]'' is defined as a set of [[tuple]]s that have the same [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]]. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a [[Table (database)|table]], which is organized into [[Row (database)|rows]] and [[Column (database)|columns]]. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] and conform to the same constraints.\n\nThe relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples, in turn, impose no order on the attributes. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as ''select'' to identify tuples, ''project'' to identify attributes, and ''join'' to combine relations. Relations can be modified using the ''insert'', ''delete'', and ''update'' operators. New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query. Similarly, queries identify tuples for updating or deleting.\n\nTuples by definition are unique. If the tuple contains a [[candidate key|candidate]] or primary key then obviously it is unique; however, a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple. The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique, but does not require a primary key to be defined. Because a tuple is unique, its attributes by definition constitute a [[superkey]].\n\n==Base and derived relations==<!-- This section is linked from Relational database -->\n{{main|Relvar|View (database)}}\nIn a relational database, all data are stored and accessed via [[relation (database)|relations]]. Relations that store data are called \"base relations\", and in implementations are called \"tables\". Other relations do not store data, but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations. These relations are sometimes called \"derived relations\". In implementations these are called \"[[View (database)|views]]\" or \"queries\". Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation, even though they may grab information from several relations. Also, derived relations can be used as an [[abstraction layer]].\n\n===Domain===\n{{main|data domain}}\nA domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set.\nThe character string ''\"ABC\"'', for instance, is not in the integer domain, but the integer value ''123'' is. Another example of domain describes the possible values for the field \"CoinFace\" as (\"Heads\",\"Tails\"). So, the field \"CoinFace\" will not accept input values like (0,1) or (H,T).\n\n==Constraints==\nConstraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing [[business rules]] in the database and support subsequent data use within the application layer. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of [[check constraint]]s.\nConstraints restrict the data that can be stored in [[relation (database)|relations]]. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a <!-- do not change the capitalization of this link without first consulting, and replying to the talk page. Any such edits will be reverted. -->[[Boolean data type|boolean]] value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations of attributes) or to an entire relation.\nSince every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints ('''domain constraints'''). The two principal rules for the relational model are known as '''entity integrity''' and '''referential integrity'''.\n\nReferential integrity is based on the simple concept of relational vector based analytic algorithms, commonly employed in cloud platforms. This enables multiple interface processing within the referential database, with the additional feature of adding an additional security layer over the dynamically defined virtual environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wiese |first1=Lena |title=Advanced data management: for SQL, noSQL, cloud and distributed databases |date=2015 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Primary key===\n{{main|Unique key|Primary key}}\nEach [[Relation (database)|relation]]/table has a primary key, this being a consequence of a relation being a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].{{Sfnp|Date|1984|268}}  A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table.  While natural attributes (attributes used to describe the data being entered) are sometimes good primary keys, [[surrogate key]]s are often used instead. A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it (for instance, in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them). The surrogate key has no intrinsic (inherent) meaning, but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple.\nAnother common occurrence, especially in regard to N:M cardinality is the [[Compound key|composite key]]. A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that (together) uniquely identify a record.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Foreign key===\n{{main|Foreign key}}\nA foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table. It relates the two keys. Foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation.  A foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables, and it effectively uses the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation.  The concept is described formally as: \"For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes, there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes.\"\n\n===Stored procedures===\n{{main|Stored procedure}}\nA stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database. Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations, like inserting a [[tuple]] into a [[relation (database)|relation]], gathering statistical information about usage patterns, or encapsulating complex [[business logic]] and calculations. Frequently they are used as an [[application programming interface]] (API) for security or simplicity. Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMS's often allow developers to take advantage of [[Procedural programming|procedural]] extensions (often vendor-specific) to the standard [[Declarative programming|declarative]] SQL syntax.\nStored procedures are not part of the relational database model, but all commercial implementations include them.\n\n===Index===\n{{main|Index (database)}}\nAn index is one way of providing quicker access to data. Indexes can be created on any combination of attributes on a [[relation (database)|relation]]. Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the index, without having to check each tuple in turn. This is analogous to using the [[Index (publishing)|index of a book]] to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found, so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for. Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques, each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution, relation size, and typical access pattern. Indices are usually implemented via [[B+ tree]]s, [[R-tree]]s, and [[Bitmap index|bitmaps]].\nIndices are usually not considered part of the database, as they are considered an implementation detail, though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database. The use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance. This is because B-tree indexes result in query times proportional to log(n) where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries (no size dependency as long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory).\n\n==Relational operations==\n{{main|Relational algebra}}\nQueries made against the relational database, and the derived [[relvars]] in the database are expressed in a [[relational calculus]] or a [[relational algebra]]. In his original relational algebra, Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each. The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical [[Set theory|set operations]]:\n* The [[Union (set theory)|union]] operator combines the tuples of two [[relation (database)|relations]] and removes all duplicate tuples from the result. The relational union operator is equivalent to the [[Union (SQL)|SQL UNION]] operator.\n* The [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] operator produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common. Intersection is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Intersect (SQL)|INTERSECT]] operator.\n* The [[Complement (set theory)|difference]] operator acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation. Difference is implemented in SQL in the form of the [[Except (SQL)|EXCEPT]] or MINUS operator.\n* The [[cartesian product]] of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria, resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation. The cartesian product is implemented in SQL as the [[Cross join]] operator.\nThe remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases:\n* The selection, or restriction, operation retrieves tuples from a relation, limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criterion, i.e. a [[subset]] in terms of set theory. The SQL equivalent of selection is the [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]] query statement with a [[Where (SQL)|WHERE]] clause.\n* The [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection operation]] extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples.\n* The join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join. In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes. MySQL's approximation of a natural join is the [[Inner join]] operator. In SQL, an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query. For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product. Thus, for N tables in an SQL query, there must be N\u22121 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product.\n* The [[Relational algebra#Division|relational division]] operation is a slightly more complex operation and essentially involves using the tuples of one relation (the dividend) to partition a second relation (the divisor). The relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator (hence the name).\nOther operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd's introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data, among others.\n\n==Normalization==\n{{main|Database normalization}}\nNormalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model. It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate non-simple domains (non-atomic values) and the redundancy (duplication) of data, which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity.  The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the [[Database normalization#Normal forms|normal forms]].\n\n==RDBMS==\n[[File:RDBMS structure.png|thumbnail|right|The general structure of a relational database.]]\n{{See also|Database#Database management system}}\nConnolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\".<ref name=\"Begg-p64\">{{cite book|last1=Connolly|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Begg| first2=Carolyn E.|date=2014|title= Database Systems \u2013 A Practical Approach to Design Implementation and Management|edition=6th|isbn=978-1292061184|publisher=Pearson|page=64 }}</ref>  RDBMS is an extension of that acronym that is sometimes used when the underlying database is relational.\n\nAn alternative definition for a ''relational database management system'' is a database management system (DBMS) based on the [[relational model]].

Relational databases have often replaced legacy [[hierarchical database]]s and [[network database]]s, because RDBMS were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued, unsuccessful challenges by [[object database]] management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called [[object-relational impedance mismatch]] between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by [[XML database]] management systems in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as [[horizontal scaling]] of [[computer cluster]]s, [[NoSQL]] databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/nosql-databases-eat-into-the-relational-database-market|access-date=2018-03-14|title=NoSQL databases eat into the relational database market}}</ref>\n\n==Distributed relational databases==\n\n[[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994.

Containing unilobar nuclei, these cells are one of the types of mononuclear leukocytes which shelter [[azurophil granules]]. The archetypal geometry of the monocyte nucleus is ellipsoidal; metaphorically bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, although the most significant distinction is that the nuclear envelope should not be hyperbolically furcated into lobes.  Contrast to this classification occurs in [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s. Monocytes compose 2% to 10% of all leukocytes in the human body and serve multiple roles in immune function. Such roles include:  replenishing resident [[macrophage]]s under normal conditions; migration within approximately 8\u201312 hours in response to [[inflammation]] signals from sites of infection in the tissues; and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into macrophages or [[dendritic cell]]s to effect an immune response.

They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm, and many internal [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] for processing foreign material.\n\n=== Dendritic cells ===\n''In vitro'', monocytes can differentiate into [[dendritic cells]] by adding the cytokines [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) and [[interleukin 4]].<ref name=\"sallusto\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallusto F, Cella M, Danieli C, Lanzavecchia A |title=Dendritic cells use macropinocytosis and the mannose receptor to concentrate macromolecules in the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment: downregulation by cytokines and bacterial products |journal=J.

These are [[phagocytosis]], antigen presentation, and cytokine production.  Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material.  Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary ([[opsonization|opsonising]]) proteins such as [[antibody|antibodies]] or [[complement system|complement]] that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern-recognition receptors that recognize pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]. [[Vacuolization]] may be present in a cell that has recently phagocytized foreign matter.\n\nMany factors produced by other cells can regulate the chemotaxis and other functions of monocytes.  These factors include most particularly [[chemokines]] such as [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] (CCL2) and [[CCL7|monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7)]]; certain [[arachidonic acid]] metabolites such as [[Leukotriene B4]] and members of the [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] family of OXE1 receptor agonists (e.g., [[5-HETE]] and 5-oxo-ETE); and [[N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine]] and other N-formylated oligopeptides which are made by bacteria and activate the [[formyl peptide receptor 1]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 8906847\n| year = 1996\n| last1 = Sozzani\n| first1 = S\n| title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: Synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3\n| journal = Journal of Immunology\n| volume = 157\n| issue = 10\n| pages = 4664\u201371\n| last2 = Zhou\n| first2 = D\n| last3 = Locati\n| first3 = M\n| last4 = Bernasconi\n| first4 = S\n| last5 = Luini\n| first5 = W\n| last6 = Mantovani\n| first6 = A\n| last7 = O'Flaherty\n| first7 = J.

The fragments can be incorporated into MHC molecules and then trafficked to the cell surface of monocytes (and macrophages and dendritic cells). This process is called [[antigen presentation]] and it leads to activation of [[T lymphocyte]]s, which then mount a specific immune response against the antigen.\n\nOther microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to production of pro-inflammatory and, with some delay, of anti-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s. Typical cytokines produced by monocytes are [[tumor necrosis factor|TNF]], [[interleukin-1|IL-1]], and [[interleukin-12|IL-12]].\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[Image:SEM blood cells.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) image of normal circulating human blood.

Containing unilobar nuclei, these cells are one of the types of mononuclear leukocytes which shelter [[azurophil granules]]. The archetypal geometry of the monocyte nucleus is ellipsoidal; metaphorically bean-shaped or kidney-shaped, although the most significant distinction is that the nuclear envelope should not be hyperbolically furcated into lobes.  Contrast to this classification occurs in [[polymorphonuclear leukocyte]]s. Monocytes compose 2% to 10% of all leukocytes in the human body and serve multiple roles in immune function. Such roles include:  replenishing resident [[macrophage]]s under normal conditions; migration within approximately 8\u201312 hours in response to [[inflammation]] signals from sites of infection in the tissues; and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] into macrophages or [[dendritic cell]]s to effect an immune response.

These are [[phagocytosis]], antigen presentation, and cytokine production.  Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material.  Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary ([[opsonization|opsonising]]) proteins such as [[antibody|antibodies]] or [[complement system|complement]] that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern-recognition receptors that recognize pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]. [[Vacuolization]] may be present in a cell that has recently phagocytized foreign matter.\n\nMany factors produced by other cells can regulate the chemotaxis and other functions of monocytes.  These factors include most particularly [[chemokines]] such as [[monocyte chemotactic protein-1]] (CCL2) and [[CCL7|monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7)]]; certain [[arachidonic acid]] metabolites such as [[Leukotriene B4]] and members of the [[5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] family of OXE1 receptor agonists (e.g., [[5-HETE]] and 5-oxo-ETE); and [[N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine]] and other N-formylated oligopeptides which are made by bacteria and activate the [[formyl peptide receptor 1]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 8906847\n| year = 1996\n| last1 = Sozzani\n| first1 = S\n| title = Stimulating properties of 5-oxo-eicosanoids for human monocytes: Synergism with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3\n| journal = Journal of Immunology\n| volume = 157\n| issue = 10\n| pages = 4664\u201371\n| last2 = Zhou\n| first2 = D\n| last3 = Locati\n| first3 = M\n| last4 = Bernasconi\n| first4 = S\n| last5 = Luini\n| first5 = W\n| last6 = Mantovani\n| first6 = A\n| last7 = O'Flaherty\n| first7 = J.

The fragments can be incorporated into MHC molecules and then trafficked to the cell surface of monocytes (and macrophages and dendritic cells). This process is called [[antigen presentation]] and it leads to activation of [[T lymphocyte]]s, which then mount a specific immune response against the antigen.\n\nOther microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to production of pro-inflammatory and, with some delay, of anti-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s.

His surname was derived from Pian del Carpine (literally  \"[[Hornbeam]] Plain\"), an area known later as [[Magione]], between [[Perugia]] and [[Cortona]]. He was one of the companions and disciples of his near-contemporary and countryman Saint [[Francis of Assisi]].\n\nHighly-esteemed within the [[Franciscan|Franciscan order]], Giovanni had a prominent role in the propagation of its teachings in northern Europe, holding in succession the offices of warden (''custos'') in [[Saxony]] and provincial (''minister'') of [[Germany]].

The defeat of European forces at Legnica led almost to [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]], controlling most of Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Europe, dread of the \"[[Tatars]]\" (Mongols) was still widespread four years later,  when [[Pope Innocent IV]] decided to dispatch the first formal Catholic mission to the Mongols. The missionaries were sent partly in protest at the Mongol invasion of [[Christendom]] and partly to gain information regarding the Khan's intentions and military strength.\n\n==Giovanni's travels==\nPope Innocent IV chose Giovanni to head this mission, and apparently was in charge of nearly everything in the mission. As a [[papal legate]], he bore a letter from the Pope to the Great Khan, ''[[Cum non solum]]''. \"At the age of sixty-three Carpini embarked from [[Lyon]],\"<ref>Montalbano, p.593.</ref> where the Pope then resided, on [[Easter]] day (16 April 1245), accompanied by another friar, Stephen of Bohemia, who broke down at [[Kaniv]] near [[Kiev]] and was left behind.

Giovanni is the first Westerner to give us the modern names for these rivers. On the Volga stood the Ordu, or camp, of [[Batu Khan|Batu]], the famous conqueror of eastern Europe and supreme Mongol commander on the western frontiers of the empire. He was one of the most senior princes of the house of [[Genghis Khan]]. Here the envoys, with their presents, had to pass between two fires to remove possible injurious thoughts and poisons,<ref>Fiovanni's ''[[Ystoria Mongalorum]]'', section X.</ref> before being presented to the prince (beginning of April 1246).\n\nBatu ordered them to proceed to the court of the supreme Khan in [[Mongolia]]. On Easter day once more (8 April 1246), they started on the second and most formidable part of their journey. They were \"so ill\", writes the legate, \"that we could scarcely sit a horse; and throughout all that Lent our food had been nought but [[millet]] with salt and water, and with only snow melted in a kettle for drink\". Their bodies were tightly bandaged so they could endure the excessive fatigue of this enormous ride, which took them across the Jaec or [[Ural River]], and north of the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] to the [[Jaxartes]] or [[Syr Darya]] (''quidam fluvius magnus cujus nomen ignoramus'', \"a big river whose name we do not know\"), and the Muslim cities that then stood on its banks. Then they went along the shores of the [[Dzungaria]]n lakes until, on the feast of St [[Mary Magdalene]] (22 July), they reached the imperial camp called Sira Orda (i.e., Yellow Pavilion), near [[Karakorum (palace)|Karakorum]] and the [[Orkhon River]]. Giovanni and his companions rode an estimated 3000 miles in 106 days.\n\nSince the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], the imperial authority was in interregnum and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]], \u00d6gedei's eldest son, was designated to the throne. His formal election in a great [[Kurultai]], or diet of the tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Orda, which entailed the gathering of 3000 to 4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute and presents. On 24 August they witnessed the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden Ordu, after which they were presented to the new emperor.\n\nThe great Khan, G\u00fcy\u00fck, refused the invitation to become [[Christians|Christian]], and demanded rather that the Pope and rulers of Europe should come to him and swear allegiance to him. The Khan did not dismiss the expedition until November. He gave them a letter to the Pope&mdash;written in Mongol, Arabic, and Latin&mdash;that was a brief imperious assertion of the Khan's office as the scourge of God. They began a long winter journey home. Often they had to lie on the bare snow, or on ground scraped bare of snow with a foot. They reached Kiev on 10 June 1247. There, and on their further journey, the Slavonic Christians welcomed them as risen from the dead, with festive hospitality. Crossing the [[Rhine]] at [[Cologne]], they found the Pope still at [[Lyon]], and delivered their report and the Khan's letter.\n\nNot long afterward, Giovanni was rewarded with the archbishopric of ''Primate of [[Serbia]]'' in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Antivari]] in [[Dalmatia]], and was sent as legate to [[Louis IX of France]]. He lived only five years following the hardships of his journey. He died, according to the Franciscan [[Martyrology]] and other authorities, on 1 August 1252.\n\n== His books ==\n{{main|Ystoria Mongalorum}}\n\nThe ''Ystoria Mongalorum'' is the report compiled by Carpine, of his trip to the [[Mongol Empire]]. Written in the 1240s, it is the oldest European account of the Mongols. Carpine was the first European to try to chronicle Mongol history. Two versions of the ''Ystoria Mongalorum'' are known to exist: Carpine's own and another, usually referred to as the ''Tartar Relation''.\n\nErik Hildinger translated Giovanni's book into English.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Story-Mongols-Whom-Call-Tartars/dp/0828320179 |title=The Story of the Mongols: Whom We Call the Tartars  |edition=2nd |last1=Carpini  |first1=Giovanni |last2=Hildinger  |first2=Erik |date=April 27, 2014  |publisher=Branden Books|access-date= |isbn=0828320179 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Exploration of Asia]]\n*[[Dzungarian Gate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Carpini, Joannes de Plano|volume=5|pages=397-399|author1=[[Henry Yule]]|author2=[[Raymond Beazley|Charles Raymond Beazley]]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Beazley  | editor-first=C.

His formal election in a great [[Kurultai]], or diet of the tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Orda, which entailed the gathering of 3000 to 4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute and presents. On 24 August they witnessed the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden Ordu, after which they were presented to the new emperor.\n\nThe great Khan, G\u00fcy\u00fck, refused the invitation to become [[Christians|Christian]], and demanded rather that the Pope and rulers of Europe should come to him and swear allegiance to him. The Khan did not dismiss the expedition until November. He gave them a letter to the Pope&mdash;written in Mongol, Arabic, and Latin&mdash;that was a brief imperious assertion of the Khan's office as the scourge of God. They began a long winter journey home. Often they had to lie on the bare snow, or on ground scraped bare of snow with a foot. They reached Kiev on 10 June 1247. There, and on their further journey, the Slavonic Christians welcomed them as risen from the dead, with festive hospitality. Crossing the [[Rhine]] at [[Cologne]], they found the Pope still at [[Lyon]], and delivered their report and the Khan's letter.\n\nNot long afterward, Giovanni was rewarded with the archbishopric of ''Primate of [[Serbia]]'' in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Antivari]] in [[Dalmatia]], and was sent as legate to [[Louis IX of France]]. He lived only five years following the hardships of his journey. He died, according to the Franciscan [[Martyrology]] and other authorities, on 1 August 1252.\n\n== His books ==\n{{main|Ystoria Mongalorum}}\n\nThe ''Ystoria Mongalorum'' is the report compiled by Carpine, of his trip to the [[Mongol Empire]]. Written in the 1240s, it is the oldest European account of the Mongols. Carpine was the first European to try to chronicle Mongol history. Two versions of the ''Ystoria Mongalorum'' are known to exist: Carpine's own and another, usually referred to as the ''Tartar Relation''.\n\nErik Hildinger translated Giovanni's book into English.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Story-Mongols-Whom-Call-Tartars/dp/0828320179 |title=The Story of the Mongols: Whom We Call the Tartars  |edition=2nd |last1=Carpini  |first1=Giovanni |last2=Hildinger  |first2=Erik |date=April 27, 2014  |publisher=Branden Books|access-date= |isbn=0828320179 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Exploration of Asia]]\n*[[Dzungarian Gate]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Carpini, Joannes de Plano|volume=5|pages=397-399|author1=[[Henry Yule]]|author2=[[Raymond Beazley|Charles Raymond Beazley]]}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Beazley  | editor-first=C.

{"title_page": "List of Secret Mountain Fort Awesome and Uncle Grandpa characters", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=September 2016}}}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' and ''Uncle Grandpa'' characters}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\nThe '''characters''' in the two American television shows ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' and ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' are created by [[Peter Browngardt]]. The two shows are produced by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] for [[Cartoon Network]].\n\n=''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' characters=\n[[File:Secret Mountain Fort Awesome promotional image.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show; clockwise from left: Slog, Festro, the Fart, Dingle and Gweelok|alt=The five main monsters of the series, shown together in their living room, facing the viewer]]\n== Main ==\n=== Festro ===\n'''Festro''' is one of the five main protagonists of one of Peter Browngardt's Animated television series, ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' on [[Cartoon Network]].\n\nFestro is purple with green eyes, two large tusks, and 2 smaller fangs in between. He is quite muscular and only wears a pair of briefs and a pair of brocro sneakers. He has black hair(spikes) and a bald spot at the top. Festro also has purple knuckles on his fingers.\n\nFestro is brash, crude, selfish, and inconsiderate. He has the personality of your typical college frat boy, as all he wants to do is slack off and party. He rarely takes responsibility for any of his actions and is usually taking advantage of his friends.\n\nDespite his disgusting behavior, Festro has moments where he owns up to his mistakes. He also has moments where he will do anything to defend his friends.\n\n=== Fart ===\n'''Fart''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''.\n\nThe Fart is a guy who is made out of butts. He has a big butt on his head that moves when he talks, and two blue eyes with eyelashes. He has a butt on his face that serves as his abs and he has three little butts on his chest that serve as the rest of his abs. He has butt cracks on his arms and legs, and butts replacing his hands and feet. He wears a green belt with a golden heart-shaped buckle on it. Ironically, the only place where he doesn't have a butt is on his rear end.\n\nThe Fart is the most sensitive and caring out of all the Disgustoids. His tastes and actions are more refined as he tries to make more of an effort to understand the humans and abide by their culture in hopes of abolishing their hatred for disgustoids. He is also the most logical out of all of them, preferring to think things through before just jumping into them.\n\n=== Gweelok ===\n'''Gweelok''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. He is the third main character of the show. he is a very intelligent technical nerd who is a walking ball of mucus. He is voiced by Paul Rugg.\n\nGweelok is a slimy green ball of mucus with a bunch of shiny red pimples and little black hairs. Gweelok also has big black with white pupils,squinted eyes with big long black thick hairy eyebrows and pink lips with yellow crooked buck teeth. Gweelok has human-like arms with black hair and sharp claws with three fingers. He has two gray metal gadget bracelets on both arms. He is the smartest person in the group.\n\nHowever, despite his intelligence, he can also be stubborn and anti-social among others. He sometimes manages to take care of things himself and keeps a tight lid on his emotions. Gweelok also has an ease to lose his temper. As shown in Gweelok Cracks, he becomes red whenever jealous or aggressive, making him quite scary to be around. His social skills are developing quite slowly,and he is able to get around with the bros just fine.\n=== Slog ===\n'''Slog''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. Slog is a short disgustoid with black fur covering his body and face. He has a large nose with peach colored flesh. He also has sharp teeth and eyes that are large with two red rings inside of it. He usually wears a stained orange shirt with no pants or shoes and has long yellow nails. He is voiced by Steve Little.\n\nSlog is not well educated, making him more vulnerable to the other disgustoids manipulating or taking advantage of him. He's usually quick to follow along with whatever Festro tells him to do, though he sometimes questions the morality of the actions (IE in The Bet) and even tries to encourage Festro to do the right thing (IE in Secret Mountain Fart Awesome) even if that encouragement falls on deaf ears. He takes pride in being completely filthy and not taking a bath.\n\nDespite not being the brightest bulb in the box, he has his moments where he is just as smart as everyone else in Secret Mountain Fort Awesome . A good example of this would be in Festro Gets Glasses where Slog insisted the correct answer to a \"3 + 3 =\" math problem was \"6\" to Festro, despite Festro not listening to him or the others. Another example of this would be in Funstro where Slog decides to take charge and develop a plan to get the old Festro back from his sadistic counterpart Funstro.\n\nSlog also has alot more compassion than the rest of his fellow disgustoids. This can be shown in Gweelok Cracks. All the other disgustoids are wondering about broad topics or selfish needs, but Slog was concerned about Dingle being turned into a basketball. This can also be seen in The Broken Chair. While running around on fire, he stops mid scream to come up to the screen and warn children that he is a cartoon and fire doesn't actually hurt him, but the kids who are viewing the show are real and shouldn't ever play with fire. This also shows Slog constantly breaks the 4th wall. Another example of Slog breaking the 4th wall would be in Labyrinth when he acknowledges the fact that if Gweelok doesn't complete the maze in 10 minutes, him and the others will be stuck with the Troll King forever with commericials.\n\n=== Dingle ===\n'''Dingle''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. \n\nDingle is a small blue disgustoid that is similar in appearance to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. His back is hunched over with long arms and bend hind legs, his teeth are sharp, he has a rather robust chest, big round eyes, and scraggly straight black hair with a bald spot at the top.\n\nDingles personality is usually quite calm despite his voice sounding a bit crazed. Like Fart, he can serve as a voice of reason sometimes amongst the other disgustoids. It is also shown that Dingle is more intelligent than he gets credit for. An example of this would be in President the Fart where he gives a well thought out presidential speech that brought the rest of the bros to tears. Another example of this would be in The Broken Chair when Dingle explained to Festro what he had been doing all day, and it included activities such as inventing several things, winning a Nobel peace prize, and horseback riding competitions.\n\nHowever, there is another side to Dingle's personality that can be mischievous and a bit sadistic. An example of this would be in The 6th Disgustoid when Dingle suggests that they should make fake money to solve their debt issues with the land lord. Another example of this would be in Funstro when Dingle suggests something in his usual gibberish voice and Gweelok comments on how illegal the plan he's suggesting sounds.\n\n=''Uncle Grandpa'' characters=\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n== Main ==\n=== Uncle Grandpa ===\n* '''Uncle \"Larry\" Grandpa''' (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\") is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n=== Belly Bag ===\n* '''Belly Bag''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) is Uncle Grandpa's talking red fanny pack nephew and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is his UG-series robotic laser hammer daughter named Samantha Grandpa. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n=== Mr. Gus ===\n* '''Michael Marshal Breakfast Gusford, Jr.''', currently better known as just '''Mr. Gus''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]), is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n=== Pizza Steve ===\n* '''Pizza J. Stevens''', currently better known as '''Pizza Steve''' (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen'), is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n\n=== Giant Realistic Flying Tiger ===\n* '''Giant Realistic Flying Tiger''' (often referred to by her initials, '''GRFT''') is a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n== Recurring ==\n=== Tiny Miracle ===\n* '''Michael \"Tiny Miracle\" Grandpa, Jr. the Robot Boy''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n=== Beary Nice and Hot Dog Person ===\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face. Beary has a positive outlook on life while Hot Dog Person is more gloomy. Each of their segments consist of the two of them trying something different for the first time (taking a bath, getting a haircut, etc.). Beary is always excited to try whatever they're doing, while Hot Dog Person is more reluctant as it seems every time he tries something new, something bad happens to him. Beary's excitement also leads to him being self-centered, as he is so wrapped up in his own emotions that he pays no attention to Hot Dog Person's plight.\n=== Charlie Burgers ===\n* Charlie Burgers the Ball-Loving Dog Next Door (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]])&nbsp;\u2013 A talking dog that befriends Uncle Grandpa and his friends. He can be well behaved and he enjoys going on adventures with Uncle Grandpa.

They have had a troubled relationship since 1983.\n=== Baby Frankie ===\n* [[Frankenstein's monster|Baby \"Frankie\" Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]])&nbsp;\u2013 A tag-along with Uncle Grandpa in his adventures.

His catchphrase is \"Behold! I am Evil Wizard!\"\n=== Priscilla Jones ===\n* '''Little Priscilla Jones''', better known as '''Aunt Grandma''' (voiced by [[Lena Headey]]), is Uncle Grandpa's nemesis with a British accent and is the main [[antagonist]] of the series who wants revenge on him for ruining her science project and rather than help her played hacky sack instead resulting in her getting second place in the science fair. She prefers to solve children's problems using simple practical solutions, the complete opposite of what Uncle Grandpa does. Her catchphrase is \"Beautiful Morning!\"\n\n== Human children and adults ==\n* Belly Kid (voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]])&nbsp;\u2013 A kid who has a big belly.

The two shows are produced by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] for [[Cartoon Network]].\n\n=''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome'' characters=\n[[File:Secret Mountain Fort Awesome promotional image.jpg|thumb|The main characters of the show; clockwise from left: Slog, Festro, the Fart, Dingle and Gweelok|alt=The five main monsters of the series, shown together in their living room, facing the viewer]]\n== Main ==\n=== Festro ===\n'''Festro''' is one of the five main protagonists of one of Peter Browngardt's Animated television series, ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' on [[Cartoon Network]].\n\nFestro is purple with green eyes, two large tusks, and 2 smaller fangs in between. He is quite muscular and only wears a pair of briefs and a pair of brocro sneakers. He has black hair(spikes) and a bald spot at the top. Festro also has purple knuckles on his fingers.\n\nFestro is brash, crude, selfish, and inconsiderate. He has the personality of your typical college frat boy, as all he wants to do is slack off and party. He rarely takes responsibility for any of his actions and is usually taking advantage of his friends.\n\nDespite his disgusting behavior, Festro has moments where he owns up to his mistakes. He also has moments where he will do anything to defend his friends.\n\n=== Fart ===\n'''Fart''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''.\n\nThe Fart is a guy who is made out of butts. He has a big butt on his head that moves when he talks, and two blue eyes with eyelashes. He has a butt on his face that serves as his abs and he has three little butts on his chest that serve as the rest of his abs. He has butt cracks on his arms and legs, and butts replacing his hands and feet. He wears a green belt with a golden heart-shaped buckle on it. Ironically, the only place where he doesn't have a butt is on his rear end.\n\nThe Fart is the most sensitive and caring out of all the Disgustoids. His tastes and actions are more refined as he tries to make more of an effort to understand the humans and abide by their culture in hopes of abolishing their hatred for disgustoids. He is also the most logical out of all of them, preferring to think things through before just jumping into them.\n\n=== Gweelok ===\n'''Gweelok''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. He is the third main character of the show. he is a very intelligent technical nerd who is a walking ball of mucus. He is voiced by Paul Rugg.\n\nGweelok is a slimy green ball of mucus with a bunch of shiny red pimples and little black hairs. Gweelok also has big black with white pupils,squinted eyes with big long black thick hairy eyebrows and pink lips with yellow crooked buck teeth. Gweelok has human-like arms with black hair and sharp claws with three fingers. He has two gray metal gadget bracelets on both arms. He is the smartest person in the group.\n\nHowever, despite his intelligence, he can also be stubborn and anti-social among others. He sometimes manages to take care of things himself and keeps a tight lid on his emotions. Gweelok also has an ease to lose his temper. As shown in Gweelok Cracks, he becomes red whenever jealous or aggressive, making him quite scary to be around. His social skills are developing quite slowly,and he is able to get around with the bros just fine.\n=== Slog ===\n'''Slog''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. Slog is a short disgustoid with black fur covering his body and face. He has a large nose with peach colored flesh. He also has sharp teeth and eyes that are large with two red rings inside of it. He usually wears a stained orange shirt with no pants or shoes and has long yellow nails. He is voiced by Steve Little.\n\nSlog is not well educated, making him more vulnerable to the other disgustoids manipulating or taking advantage of him. He's usually quick to follow along with whatever Festro tells him to do, though he sometimes questions the morality of the actions (IE in The Bet) and even tries to encourage Festro to do the right thing (IE in Secret Mountain Fart Awesome) even if that encouragement falls on deaf ears. He takes pride in being completely filthy and not taking a bath.\n\nDespite not being the brightest bulb in the box, he has his moments where he is just as smart as everyone else in Secret Mountain Fort Awesome . A good example of this would be in Festro Gets Glasses where Slog insisted the correct answer to a \"3 + 3 =\" math problem was \"6\" to Festro, despite Festro not listening to him or the others. Another example of this would be in Funstro where Slog decides to take charge and develop a plan to get the old Festro back from his sadistic counterpart Funstro.\n\nSlog also has alot more compassion than the rest of his fellow disgustoids. This can be shown in Gweelok Cracks. All the other disgustoids are wondering about broad topics or selfish needs, but Slog was concerned about Dingle being turned into a basketball. This can also be seen in The Broken Chair. While running around on fire, he stops mid scream to come up to the screen and warn children that he is a cartoon and fire doesn't actually hurt him, but the kids who are viewing the show are real and shouldn't ever play with fire. This also shows Slog constantly breaks the 4th wall. Another example of Slog breaking the 4th wall would be in Labyrinth when he acknowledges the fact that if Gweelok doesn't complete the maze in 10 minutes, him and the others will be stuck with the Troll King forever with commericials.\n\n=== Dingle ===\n'''Dingle''' is one of the five main protagonists of ''Secret Mountain Fort Awesome''. \n\nDingle is a small blue disgustoid that is similar in appearance to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. His back is hunched over with long arms and bend hind legs, his teeth are sharp, he has a rather robust chest, big round eyes, and scraggly straight black hair with a bald spot at the top.\n\nDingles personality is usually quite calm despite his voice sounding a bit crazed. Like Fart, he can serve as a voice of reason sometimes amongst the other disgustoids. It is also shown that Dingle is more intelligent than he gets credit for. An example of this would be in President the Fart where he gives a well thought out presidential speech that brought the rest of the bros to tears. Another example of this would be in The Broken Chair when Dingle explained to Festro what he had been doing all day, and it included activities such as inventing several things, winning a Nobel peace prize, and horseback riding competitions.\n\nHowever, there is another side to Dingle's personality that can be mischievous and a bit sadistic. An example of this would be in The 6th Disgustoid when Dingle suggests that they should make fake money to solve their debt issues with the land lord. Another example of this would be in Funstro when Dingle suggests something in his usual gibberish voice and Gweelok comments on how illegal the plan he's suggesting sounds.\n\n=''Uncle Grandpa'' characters=\n{{Stack|[[File:Uncle Grandpa.png|thumb|Main characters from the series; from left to right: Uncle Grandpa and Belly Bag, Pizza Steve, Mr. Gus and Giant Realistic Flying Tiger (bottom)]]|float=right}}\n== Main ==\n=== Uncle Grandpa ===\n* '''Uncle \"Larry\" Grandpa''' (voiced by [[Peter Browngardt]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in \"For Pete! Love, Pen\") is a magical shapeshifting humanoid who is the uncle-grandpa of everyone in the world with a large, rectangular head, a brown [[horseshoe moustache]], a pink nose, a [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propeller hat]] that talks and an outfit consisting of a white T-shirt, [[lederhosen]] with rainbow [[suspenders]], knee high [[tube sock]]s, and black slippers. His outward appearance is depicted as rather clownish and unsophisticated, but he is well-meaning, fun-loving, supportive, and surprisingly competent when need be. His catchphrase is \"Good morning!\"\n=== Belly Bag ===\n* '''Belly Bag''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) is Uncle Grandpa's talking red fanny pack nephew and best friend who carries all of his priceless valuables, especially Uncle Grandpa's weapon of choice, which is his UG-series robotic laser hammer daughter named Samantha Grandpa. Belly Bag's insides contain many weird objects and dimensions, including a castle where Frankenstein lives. Despite being practically attached to Uncle Grandpa, he has the ability to walk and can produce multiple hands from inside his body. He even has the ability to see despite having no visible eyes. In the second Uncle Grandpa short \"Secret Mountain Uncle Grandpa\", he is referred to as Fanny Pack and voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]. His catchphrase is \"What's cookin', good-lookin'?\"\n=== Mr. Gus ===\n* '''Michael Marshal Breakfast Gusford, Jr.''', currently better known as just '''Mr. Gus''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]), is usually the voice of reason. He is a large, serious, yet somewhat grouchy green dinosaur (Reptoid) who was Uncle Grandpa's rival in \"Leg Wrestler\", but eventually became his friend and bodyguard. He is unfazed by most of Uncle Grandpa's eccentricities and seems to have an even temper despite his roommates, but often loses his temper, especially where Pizza Steve's antics are concerned. He's older, and more mature than Uncle Grandpa. One of Mr. Gus' favorite parts of the day is 9:00 PM, which is his designated bathroom time, and during that period he likes to take a bubble bath and read for an hour. His catchphrase is \"You're just sayin' that to get under my skin.\"\n=== Pizza Steve ===\n* '''Pizza J. Stevens''', currently better known as '''Pizza Steve''' (voiced by [[Adam DeVine]], [[Pendleton Ward]] in 'For Pete! Love, Pen'), is an anthropomorphic pepperoni pizza slice with sunglasses and a member of Uncle Grandpa's crew. He is depicted as extremely vain, troublesome, and often brags about how cool and awesome he is, which annoys his friend Mr. Gus. Despite this, he pretends to be very popular and a hit with women. He is a good friend of Uncle Grandpa. Pizza Steve is featured in his own cartoon shorts entitled \"A Slice of Life with Pizza Steve\", which usually involve Pizza Steve exaggerating his abilities. In \"Tiger Trails\", he claims to be a black belt in Italian Karate, but he wears the black belt over his eyes instead of around his waist. He also is meant to cheat, like for instance in \u201cLeg Wrestler\u201d, he trained Uncle Grandpa, and forced Mr. Gus to do his chores, so uncle Grandpa could Cream him. His catchphrase is \"I'm like a modern-day Thomas Einstein except a brazillion times better!\"\n\n=== Giant Realistic Flying Tiger ===\n* '''Giant Realistic Flying Tiger''' (often referred to by her initials, '''GRFT''') is a static photographic cutout of a [[tiger]] that Uncle Grandpa rides on to get around. Tiger is his pet and other best friend, and while she exhibits normal tiger traits such as only being able to communicate by roaring, she is able to fly and leaves a rainbow trail as she goes. The rainbow trail is also expelled from Tiger's rear end when she passes gas. Her personality is a cross between that of a stereotypical [[teenage]] girl, a house cat, and a real-life tiger. In order for Tiger's emotions to be shown, only certain parts of her body (specifically her facial ones) are animated. This is done in a stop-motion style.\n\n== Recurring ==\n=== Tiny Miracle ===\n* '''Michael \"Tiny Miracle\" Grandpa, Jr. the Robot Boy''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is Uncle Grandpa's imaginary UG-series robot grandson that can perform tiny miracles by just a series of unnecessary moves and then technically performing one only to lead up to another tiny miracle. He sounds like a 1980s microphone. According to Uncle Grandpa, he is his trusty robot helper buddy. He can be summoned by a person saying something that includes the words \"tiny miracle\" in it and then the task he/she is attempting. His catchphrase is \"Did somebody say \"tiny miracle\"?\"\n=== Beary Nice and Hot Dog Person ===\n* Beary Nice (voiced by Audie Harrison) and Hot Dog Person (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) are the stars of their own recurring segment, \"New Experiences\". Beary is an anthropomorphic teddy bear with a red nose and a bow tie and Hot Dog Person is an anthropomorphic cyborg [[Hot dog|frankfurter]] with a face. Beary has a positive outlook on life while Hot Dog Person is more gloomy. Each of their segments consist of the two of them trying something different for the first time (taking a bath, getting a haircut, etc.). Beary is always excited to try whatever they're doing, while Hot Dog Person is more reluctant as it seems every time he tries something new, something bad happens to him. Beary's excitement also leads to him being self-centered, as he is so wrapped up in his own emotions that he pays no attention to Hot Dog Person's plight.\n=== Charlie Burgers ===\n* Charlie Burgers the Ball-Loving Dog Next Door (voiced by [[Brian Posehn]])&nbsp;\u2013 A talking dog that befriends Uncle Grandpa and his friends. He can be well behaved and he enjoys going on adventures with Uncle Grandpa. His catchphrase is \"I love my ball!\"\n=== Santa Claus ===\n* Brother-Santa Claus Grandpa (voiced by [[Bob Joles]] ) is the famous figure for Christmas and is revealed to be Uncle Grandpa's brother in the Christmas special. They have had a troubled relationship since 1983.\n=== Baby Frankie ===\n* [[Frankenstein's monster|Baby \"Frankie\" Frankenstein]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]])&nbsp;\u2013 A tag-along with Uncle Grandpa in his adventures.
