It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away.

A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual.

Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

It is typically displayed when the danger increases. A study found that yowls could last as long as two seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Agonistic vocalizations: this term denotes a combination of growls, moans, and hisses that is followed by spitting, a feature more conspicuous in cheetah than in other cats. In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In Iraq cheetahs were reported from [[Basra]] in the 1920s. Conservation efforts began in Iran in the 1950s; this was followed by an increase in cheetah sightings over the years in some areas. However, the Iranian Revolution (1979) and the Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988) led to severe depletion of prey.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk.
