Kennedy Stadium''' (formerly '''Philadelphia Municipal Stadium''' and '''Sesquicentennial Stadium''') was an open-air stadium in [[Philadelphia]] that stood from 1926 to 1992. The [[South Philadelphia]] stadium was on the east side of the far southern end of [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] at a location now part of the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]]. Designed by the architectural firm of Simon & Simon<ref>* [http://www.phila.gov/phils/docs/Inventor/graphics/archser/S067.htm City Architect; Department of City Architecture; Philadelphia Information Locator System]</ref> in a classic 1920s style with a horseshoe seating design that surrounded a track and football field, at its peak the facility seated in excess of 102,000 people. Bleachers were later added at the open (North) end.\n\nEach section of the main portion of the stadium contained its own entrance, which displayed the letters of each section above the entrance, in a nod to ancient Roman stadia. Section designators were divided at the south end of the stadium (the bottom of the \"U\" shape) between West and East, starting with Sections WA and EA and proceeding north. The north bleachers started with Section NA.\n\nIt was built of concrete, stone, and brick on a {{convert|13.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| title=JFK Stadium: End Zone Near | date=February 5, 1992| publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]| url =| work =| page =B2 | accessdate = | language = }}</ref>\n\n==Opening and names==\nJFK Stadium was built as part of the [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition]]. Originally known as Sesquicentennial Stadium when it opened April 15, 1926, the structure was renamed Philadelphia Municipal Stadium<ref>{{cite book| author=E.L Austin and Odell Hauser| title=The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition (Chapter XXX \"MUNICIPAL STADIUM\") pp 419-423; Philadelphia, PA (1929)}}</ref> after the Exposition's closing ceremonies. In 1964, it was renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in memory of the [[John F. Kennedy|35th President of the United States]] who had been [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] the year before.\n\n==Football==\nThe stadium's first tenants (in [[1926 American Football League season|1926]]) were the [[Philadelphia Quakers (AFL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] of the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]], whose Saturday afternoon home games were a popular mainstay of the Exposition. The Quakers won the league championship but the league folded after one year.\n\nThe [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] also played here intermittently until the team's demise in 1931. Two years later the [[National Football League]] awarded another team to the city, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  The Eagles had a four-season stint as tenants of the stadium before moving to [[Shibe Park]] for the 1940 season, although the team did play at Municipal in 1941. The Eagles also used the stadium for practices in the 1970s and 1980s, even locating their first practice bubble there before moving it to the [[Veterans Stadium]] parking lot following the stadium's condemnation.\n[[File:Mass Transportation (Army-Navy Game) by Grif Teller, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pennsylvania Railroad]] trains lined up at a temporary station outside the stadium after the 1955 Army-Navy game]]\nThe stadium became known chiefly as the \"neutral\" venue for a total of 41 annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game]]s played there between 1936 and 1979. The streak was briefly broken during [[World War II]], when travel restrictions forced three games to be held on campus and one game to be played in [[Baltimore]]. From 1960 to 1970 it served as [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy's]] home field when they played [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. It also hosted the Notre Dame-Army game in 1957, marking the only time the Cadets have hosted the Fighting Irish outside of New York or New Jersey. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its successors, [[Penn Central]] and [[Conrail]], offered game-day service to all Army-Navy games, using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year on the railroad's nearby Greenwich freight yard. The service, with 40-odd trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sZVp41FVOsC&lpg=PA138&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Crossroads of Commerce: The Pennsylvania Railroad Calendar Art of Grif Teller |first=Dan |last=Cupper |year=1992 |page=138 |isbn=9780811729031 |publisher=Stackpole Books |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelfroio.com/blog/tothegame |title=To The Game: A Pennsylvania Railroad Tradition |first=Michael |last=Froio |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA.F. \"Bud\" Dudley, a former [[Villanova University]] athletic-director, created the [[Liberty Bowl]] in Philadelphia in [[1959 college football season|1959]]. The game was played at Municipal Stadium and was the only cold-weather bowl game of its time. It was plagued by poor attendance; the [[1963 Liberty Bowl|1963]] game between [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] and [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]] drew less than 10,000 fans and absorbed a loss in excess of $40,000. The Liberty Bowl's best game was its first in 1959, when 38,000 fans watched [[1959 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] beat [[1959 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] 7\u20130. However, even that crowd was swallowed up in the environment. [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] convinced Dudley to move his game from Philadelphia to Atlantic City's [[Boardwalk Hall|Convention Hall]] for [[1964 Liberty Bowl|1964]]. 6,059 fans saw [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] rout [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] in the first indoor bowl game. Dudley moved the game to [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Memphis]] in [[1965 college football season|1965]] where it has been played since.<ref>{{cite news| first=John| last=Antonick| title=Unique Game| date=June 22, 2005| publisher=MSNsportsNET.com| url=http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=8032| work=West Virginia Mountaineers| accessdate=April 26, 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526231839/http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=8032| archivedate=May 26, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium hosted Philadelphia's City Title high school football championship game in 1939 and 1978. [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School|St. Joe's Prep]] defeated [[Northeast High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Northeast]], 27-6, in 1939. [[Frankford High School|Frankford]] beat [[Archbishop Wood Catholic High School|Archbishop Wood]], 27-7, in heavy rain in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tedsilary.com/FBCitytitlegames.htm|title=FB City Title Recaps|accessdate=April 23, 2009 |work=tedsillary.com|publisher=Ted Sillary|date=}}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 1950, the [[Cleveland Browns]], playing their first season in the NFL after dominating the defunct [[All-America Football Conference]] (winning all four league titles), played their first NFL game against the two-time defending NFL Champion [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Philadelphia was the center of the professional football universe at the time; not only did the city host the defending NFL Champions, but the league offices were also in town, headed up by NFL commissioner (and Philadelphia native) Bert Bell. To accommodate the anticipated ticket demand, the game was moved from [[Shibe Park]]; this proved to be a wise decision, as the contest drew a then NFL-record 71,237\u2014nearly doubling the Eagles' prior attendance mark of 38,230. Many thought Bell had scheduled this game of defending league champions to teach the upstarts from the AAFC a lesson. Instead, the Browns shredded the Eagles' vaunted defense in a 35-10 rout, and went on to win the NFL Championship that first year in the league.\n\nIn 1958, some 15,000 fans attended a [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] game between the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] with proceeds from ticket sales going to local charities. (Hamilton won, 24-18, in what remains the only regular-season CFL game played between two Canadian teams outside of Canada.)\n\nThe stadium was home to the [[Philadelphia Bell]] of the [[World Football League]] in 1974. The Bell seemed to give the WFL instant credibility when it announced a crowd of 55,534 for the home opener, and 64,719 for the second home game. However, when the Bell paid city taxes on the attendance figures two weeks later, it emerged that the gates had been wildly inflated. The team sold block tickets to area businesses at a discount, and the tax revenue was not reported. In turn, many of these businesses gave away the tickets for free. The actual paid attendance for the home opener was only 13,855, while the paid attendance for the second game was only 6,200\u2014and many of ''those'' tickets were sold well below face value. The \"Papergate\" scandal made the Bell and the WFL look foolish, and proved to be a humiliation from which neither recovered. The team played at [[Franklin Field]] in 1975; the league folded late into that season.\n\n==Other sports==\nOn September 23, 1926, an announced crowd of 120,557 packed the then-new Stadium during a rainstorm to witness [[Gene Tunney]] capture the world heavyweight boxing title from [[Jack Dempsey]]. Undefeated [[Rocky Marciano]] knocked out [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] at the stadium in 1952 to win boxing's heavyweight championship.\n\nOn June 26, 1957, a 150-lap [[NASCAR Convertible Division|NASCAR convertible]] race was held at the Stadium, which was won by [[Bob Welborn]] in a [[1957 Chevrolet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1957 NASCAR convertible race|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1957-25/V|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJFK Stadium hosted [[Team America (soccer)|Team America's]] soccer match against [[England national football team|England]] on May 31, 1976, as part of the [[1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament]]. In the game, England defeated Team America, 3-1, in front of a small crowd of 16,239. England and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] had failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976 European Championship final tournament]] and so they joined [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and Team America, composed of international stars playing in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]], in the four team competition. Because Team America was composed of international players and was not the [[United States men's national soccer team|American national team]], [[the Football Association]] does not regard England's match against Team America as an official international match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/CmpT/CmpT1976.html|title=England 's Minor Tournaments and Cups; U.S.A.

The Bob Welch and Steve Miller sets were marred by PA system problems. The Fleetwood Mac set was marred by the unreliable vocals of Stevie Nicks, who was disinterested at best and off-key or off-tempo at worst.

Kennedy Stadium''' (formerly '''Philadelphia Municipal Stadium''' and '''Sesquicentennial Stadium''') was an open-air stadium in [[Philadelphia]] that stood from 1926 to 1992. The [[South Philadelphia]] stadium was on the east side of the far southern end of [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] at a location now part of the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]]. Designed by the architectural firm of Simon & Simon<ref>* [http://www.phila.gov/phils/docs/Inventor/graphics/archser/S067.htm City Architect; Department of City Architecture; Philadelphia Information Locator System]</ref> in a classic 1920s style with a horseshoe seating design that surrounded a track and football field, at its peak the facility seated in excess of 102,000 people. Bleachers were later added at the open (North) end.\n\nEach section of the main portion of the stadium contained its own entrance, which displayed the letters of each section above the entrance, in a nod to ancient Roman stadia. Section designators were divided at the south end of the stadium (the bottom of the \"U\" shape) between West and East, starting with Sections WA and EA and proceeding north. The north bleachers started with Section NA.\n\nIt was built of concrete, stone, and brick on a {{convert|13.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| title=JFK Stadium: End Zone Near | date=February 5, 1992| publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]| url =| work =| page =B2 | accessdate = | language = }}</ref>\n\n==Opening and names==\nJFK Stadium was built as part of the [[Sesquicentennial Exposition|1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition]]. Originally known as Sesquicentennial Stadium when it opened April 15, 1926, the structure was renamed Philadelphia Municipal Stadium<ref>{{cite book| author=E.L Austin and Odell Hauser| title=The Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition (Chapter XXX \"MUNICIPAL STADIUM\") pp 419-423; Philadelphia, PA (1929)}}</ref> after the Exposition's closing ceremonies. In 1964, it was renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in memory of the [[John F. Kennedy|35th President of the United States]] who had been [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] the year before.\n\n==Football==\nThe stadium's first tenants (in [[1926 American Football League season|1926]]) were the [[Philadelphia Quakers (AFL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] of the [[American Football League (1926)|first American Football League]], whose Saturday afternoon home games were a popular mainstay of the Exposition. The Quakers won the league championship but the league folded after one year.\n\nThe [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] also played here intermittently until the team's demise in 1931. Two years later the [[National Football League]] awarded another team to the city, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  The Eagles had a four-season stint as tenants of the stadium before moving to [[Shibe Park]] for the 1940 season, although the team did play at Municipal in 1941. The Eagles also used the stadium for practices in the 1970s and 1980s, even locating their first practice bubble there before moving it to the [[Veterans Stadium]] parking lot following the stadium's condemnation.\n[[File:Mass Transportation (Army-Navy Game) by Grif Teller, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pennsylvania Railroad]] trains lined up at a temporary station outside the stadium after the 1955 Army-Navy game]]\nThe stadium became known chiefly as the \"neutral\" venue for a total of 41 annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game]]s played there between 1936 and 1979. The streak was briefly broken during [[World War II]], when travel restrictions forced three games to be held on campus and one game to be played in [[Baltimore]]. From 1960 to 1970 it served as [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy's]] home field when they played [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. It also hosted the Notre Dame-Army game in 1957, marking the only time the Cadets have hosted the Fighting Irish outside of New York or New Jersey. The [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its successors, [[Penn Central]] and [[Conrail]], offered game-day service to all Army-Navy games, using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year on the railroad's nearby Greenwich freight yard. The service, with 40-odd trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sZVp41FVOsC&lpg=PA138&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Crossroads of Commerce: The Pennsylvania Railroad Calendar Art of Grif Teller |first=Dan |last=Cupper |year=1992 |page=138 |isbn=9780811729031 |publisher=Stackpole Books |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelfroio.com/blog/tothegame |title=To The Game: A Pennsylvania Railroad Tradition |first=Michael |last=Froio |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA.F. \"Bud\" Dudley, a former [[Villanova University]] athletic-director, created the [[Liberty Bowl]] in Philadelphia in [[1959 college football season|1959]]. The game was played at Municipal Stadium and was the only cold-weather bowl game of its time. It was plagued by poor attendance; the [[1963 Liberty Bowl|1963]] game between [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] and [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]] drew less than 10,000 fans and absorbed a loss in excess of $40,000. The Liberty Bowl's best game was its first in 1959, when 38,000 fans watched [[1959 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] beat [[1959 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] 7\u20130. However, even that crowd was swallowed up in the environment. [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] convinced Dudley to move his game from Philadelphia to Atlantic City's [[Boardwalk Hall|Convention Hall]] for [[1964 Liberty Bowl|1964]]. 6,059 fans saw [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] rout [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] in the first indoor bowl game. Dudley moved the game to [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Memphis]] in [[1965 college football season|1965]] where it has been played since.<ref>{{cite news| first=John| last=Antonick| title=Unique Game| date=June 22, 2005| publisher=MSNsportsNET.com| url=http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=8032| work=West Virginia Mountaineers| accessdate=April 26, 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526231839/http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=8032| archivedate=May 26, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium hosted Philadelphia's City Title high school football championship game in 1939 and 1978. [[Saint Joseph's Preparatory School|St. Joe's Prep]] defeated [[Northeast High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Northeast]], 27-6, in 1939.

Philadelphia was the center of the professional football universe at the time; not only did the city host the defending NFL Champions, but the league offices were also in town, headed up by NFL commissioner (and Philadelphia native) Bert Bell. To accommodate the anticipated ticket demand, the game was moved from [[Shibe Park]]; this proved to be a wise decision, as the contest drew a then NFL-record 71,237\u2014nearly doubling the Eagles' prior attendance mark of 38,230. Many thought Bell had scheduled this game of defending league champions to teach the upstarts from the AAFC a lesson. Instead, the Browns shredded the Eagles' vaunted defense in a 35-10 rout, and went on to win the NFL Championship that first year in the league.\n\nIn 1958, some 15,000 fans attended a [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] game between the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] and the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] with proceeds from ticket sales going to local charities. (Hamilton won, 24-18, in what remains the only regular-season CFL game played between two Canadian teams outside of Canada.)\n\nThe stadium was home to the [[Philadelphia Bell]] of the [[World Football League]] in 1974. The Bell seemed to give the WFL instant credibility when it announced a crowd of 55,534 for the home opener, and 64,719 for the second home game. However, when the Bell paid city taxes on the attendance figures two weeks later, it emerged that the gates had been wildly inflated. The team sold block tickets to area businesses at a discount, and the tax revenue was not reported. In turn, many of these businesses gave away the tickets for free. The actual paid attendance for the home opener was only 13,855, while the paid attendance for the second game was only 6,200\u2014and many of ''those'' tickets were sold well below face value. The \"Papergate\" scandal made the Bell and the WFL look foolish, and proved to be a humiliation from which neither recovered. The team played at [[Franklin Field]] in 1975; the league folded late into that season.\n\n==Other sports==\nOn September 23, 1926, an announced crowd of 120,557 packed the then-new Stadium during a rainstorm to witness [[Gene Tunney]] capture the world heavyweight boxing title from [[Jack Dempsey]]. Undefeated [[Rocky Marciano]] knocked out [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] at the stadium in 1952 to win boxing's heavyweight championship.\n\nOn June 26, 1957, a 150-lap [[NASCAR Convertible Division|NASCAR convertible]] race was held at the Stadium, which was won by [[Bob Welborn]] in a [[1957 Chevrolet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1957 NASCAR convertible race|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1957-25/V|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJFK Stadium hosted [[Team America (soccer)|Team America's]] soccer match against [[England national football team|England]] on May 31, 1976, as part of the [[1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament]]. In the game, England defeated Team America, 3-1, in front of a small crowd of 16,239. England and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] had failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976 European Championship final tournament]] and so they joined [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and Team America, composed of international stars playing in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]], in the four team competition. Because Team America was composed of international players and was not the [[United States men's national soccer team|American national team]], [[the Football Association]] does not regard England's match against Team America as an official international match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/CmpT/CmpT1976.html|title=England 's Minor Tournaments and Cups; U.S.A.

There had been reports of falling concrete for some time before then.  The Grateful Dead concert was allowed to go ahead due to strict no-smoking regulations that had been enacted some time before.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| title=City Closes JFK Stadium| date=July 14, 1989 | publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]| url= https://archive.is/uGr91| work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref> Renovating and repairing the stadium was quickly ruled out, and it was demolished on September 23, 1992.<ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| title=Goodbye To JFK Stadium As Demolition Firm Is Hired| date=March 10, 1992 | publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]| url=| work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=| last=| title=Wreckers, 1, JFK Stadium, 0| date=April 21, 1992 | publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]| url=| work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref><ref name=\"FinalDays\">{{cite web|title=JFK Stadium Philadelphia Final Days 1993|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAXpilczy8|website=YouTube|accessdate=10 September 2017|format=Video}}</ref><ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Ralph |title=Wrecking Ball To Leave Only Memories Of JFK Stadium|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920322&slug=1482395|accessdate=10 September 2017|work=The Seattle Times|date=22 March 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe 1993 Philadelphia stop for the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival was held at the JFK Stadium site on [[List of Lollapalooza lineups by year#1993|July 18, 1993]].

His girlfriend, [[Kate Moreau|Kate]], visits him in prison to break up with him. In order to get her back, he stages an elaborate prison break. Peter Burke, the agent who put Neal in prison to begin with, quickly catches up with Neal, where it is revealed that Kate has left only a bottle of [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] behind at their apartment. Neal is quickly brought back to prison, where he is told he will have to serve four more years. After helping Peter and his team find an elusive criminal, the Dutchman ([[Mark Sheppard]]), Neal is released on the condition that he wear an [[ankle monitor]] that records his movements. He easily finds lodging with an elderly woman, [[June (White Collar)|June]], and the two quickly become close.\n\nThroughout the series, Neal helps the FBI solve difficult cases, using his vast knowledge of white collar crime. He is a skilled thief and art forger, among other criminal activities. Neal uses his position at the FBI in order to get closer to Kate; however, after her death, he uses it to find her killer.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Neal spends much of his time researching Kate's disappearance. With the help of his best friend, [[Mozzie (White Collar)|Mozzie]], Neal learns that Kate was taken by a man with an FBI ring. After discovering that Peter had visited her, Neal believes that Peter is the man behind her disappearance. This causes a strain on their relationship, though it eventually recovers. Neal finds that in order to free Kate, he must find the music box. He recruits an old friend, [[Alexandra Hunter|Alex Hunter]], to do so in \"[[Home Invasion (White Collar)|Home Invasion]]\" (1.11). The two continue to search over the next several episodes. In \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14), after Neal locates Kate, who has boarded an airplane, he witnesses her death.\n\nOver the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Neal reveals much about his past. In \"[[Forging Bonds]]\" (2.11), he tells Peter that his first con with Mozzie involved a man named [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]]. Adler introduced Neal to Kate, and the two quickly began a relationship. Months later, Neal and Kate discovered that Adler had been caught running a Ponzi scheme, and they lost all of their money. After Kate realized that Neal was conning her as well, she left him and began running her own cons. However, Neal found her. After the two confessed their love, Neal was arrested (for the first time) by Peter. Back in the present day, Neal meets an insurance investigator named [[#Sara Ellis|Sara Ellis]]. At first, Sara tries to have Neal arrested for the theft of a painting. However, the two, who have a history, eventually begin dating. Upon Adler's return and defeat in \"[[Under the Radar (White Collar)|Under the Radar]]\", Mozzie's machinations to steal the U-boat treasures lead to Peter suspecting that Neal had conned him into leading him to the treasure. Neal, upset over Peter's decided lack in trust in him, simply demands for him to prove it.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, Neal has been recommended for a possible commutation due to his part in capturing super evil-doer, Matthew Keller. Keller kidnapped Peter\u2019s wife Elizabeth ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]) in order to ransom a treasure Neal and his fellow con, Mozzie ([[Willie Garson]]), had in their possession. Peter and Diana spent much of last season trying to find out if Neal had the treasure and Peter is justifiably pissed off that a psychopath has snatched his wife to get it. Neal and Mozzie are ready to give up the treasure for Elizabeth and Neal and Peter work on some bromance trust issues while trying to stall Keller long enough for Diana and Jones to locate Elizabeth. Because Keller confesses to stealing the treasure, Neal doesn\u2019t go to prison and is offered a chance at freedom. The rest of the season turns into a test of Neal\u2019s trustworthiness with each case they solve, and how they solve it, weighing on Peter\u2019s mind as he decides what to tell the hearing panel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hallowell|first1=Lucy|title=\"White Collar\" Season 3 Recap: What Diana\u2019s been up to|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/99150-white-collar-season-3-recap-what-dianas-been-up-to|website=AfterEllen|publisher=AfterEllen}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Burke===\n[[Special agent|Special Agent in Charge]]<ref name=parting>{{Cite episode |title=Parting Shots |episodelink=List of White Collar episodes |series=White Collar |network=[[USA Network]] |date=July 31, 2012 |season=4 |number=4 |minutes=c. 40 |quote=It is our recommendation that he [Peter Burke] be reinstated as Special Agent in Charge of the Manhattan White Collar Division effective immediately.}}</ref> Peter Burke ([[Tim DeKay]]) is an [[FBI]] agent, and the head of the Manhattan White Collar Division.<ref name=parting/> He is married to [[Elizabeth Burke (White Collar)|Elizabeth]] and is the direct superior of [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], [[Diana Barrigan|Diana]], and [[Clinton Jones (White Collar)|Jones]]. He has a dog named Satchmo.\n\nPeter is a no-nonsense, by-the-book agent, who is extremely devoted to his wife. After teaming up with Neal, he is forced to enter various awkward situations, including flirting with other women and assuming various aliases (including, in one case, Neal Caffrey). However, Peter still upholds high moral and ethical standards.\n\nIn the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]], it is shown that Peter has been working the Neal Caffrey case for several years. After spending three years attempting to catch Neal, he finally did, and Neal went to prison for almost four years. However, Neal escaped from prison. This time, Peter easily caught him, finding him at the apartment he had shared with [[Kate Moreau|Kate]]. Over the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Peter warns Neal, on various occasions, not to investigate Kate's disappearance, as it could cause him to slip back into his criminal ways. The two catch various white collar criminals together, including thieves, murderers, and other conmen.\n\nIn a third season episode, it is revealed that Peter has an astronomy hobby which was put to good use to solve a case involving an [[astronomical]] puzzle involving a kidnapper using an inheritance as a ransom. In another third season episode, Burke is revealed to be a Yankee and a former American baseball player. His brief career stopped only because of an injury.\n\nBy the end of the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Peter discovers that Neal may have been conning him from the very beginning and has very high suspicions that Neal stole the submarine treasure. In the third season summer finale, things between Peter and Matthew Keller become very personal when Keller kidnaps Elizabeth to force Peter to help him steal the treasure from Neal.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 3)|third season]] Peter acknowledges his [[Scouting in popular culture#Fictional Eagle Scouts|Eagle Scout]] rank responding to his wife, \"Yeah, Eagle Scout, always be prepared\" when asked about having the will in his pocket.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Where There's a Will |series=White Collar |network=USA Network |date=July 14, 2011 |season=3 |number=2 |transcript=Elizabeth: \"You just happened to have the will in your pocket?\"  Peter: \"Yeah, Eagle Scout, always be prepared.\"}}</ref> Peter also informs Neal that after college he was drafted into minor league baseball as a pitcher. He later quit this after a serious injury occurred during his second week there.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn Season six, Elizabeth becomes pregnant and in the series finale has their son, whom they name Neal.\n\n===Mozzie===\nMozzie ([[Willie Garson]]) is a close friend to [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], and a fellow conman. He is characterized by his quirky qualities and generally mysterious nature.\n\nMozzie first met Neal while they were independent conmen, as shown through flashbacks in \"[[Forging Bonds]]\" (2.11). The two set up a long con on a man named [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]], though the plan eventually failed.\n\nThroughout the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Mozzie uses his various connections to the criminal world to help Neal with both his investigations with [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]] and his private investigation into [[Kate Moreau|Kate's]] disappearance. Mozzie is very distrusting of the FBI, and doesn't even meet Peter until mid-way through the season. After their first encounter, Peter refers to Mozzie as \"Neal's friend\", and Mozzie refers to Peter and [[Elizabeth Burke (White Collar)|Elizabeth]] as \"Suit\" and \"Mrs. Suit\". He goes on to form a very close friendship with Elizabeth which Peter finds both amusing and questionable.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Mozzie becomes more involved with the FBI, especially when a close friend and romantic interest of his, Gina, is kidnapped in \"[[By the Book (White Collar)|By the Book]]\" (2.04). He also becomes much more involved with the investigation into Kate's murder, discovering the identity of the last person Kate spoke to (Fowler) and breaking the code of the music box. However, in \"[[Point Blank (White Collar)|Point Blank]]\" (2.09), Mozzie is shot and left for dead, before he can tell anyone the meaning of the music box code. He barely survives, and later joins Burke's Seven (in the episode [[Burke's Seven|of the same name]]) to take down the man who shot him. Eventually, he and Neal discover that the man who shot him is involved with [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]], the man behind Kate's death.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn the [[White Collar (season 3)|third season]], it is revealed that Mozzie was abandoned on the doorstep of an orphanage with a stuffed bear named Mozart. Unable to pronounce the name \"Mozart\", he used to call the Bear \"Mozzie\". He kept the bear with him even after he ran to New York to escape the Detroit Mob, and he named himself after it. He had to leave Detroit because he conned the local mob boss there. It was also revealed that he is the famed Dentist of Detroit, this all occurred when Mozzie was the age of twelve years, which shocks and impresses both Neal and Peter.\n\nIn \"Out of the Frying Pan\" (5.2), it is revealed that Mozzie's real name is Theodore (Teddy) Winters.\n\n===Lauren Cruz===\nSpecial Agent Lauren Cruz ([[Natalie Morales (actress)|Natalie Morales]]) is an FBI agent who briefly worked in the white collar crime unit under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. She transferred to his team in \"[[Threads (White Collar)|Threads]]\" (1.02) and left after the events of \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14).  Morales left the show before production of the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]].\n\nLauren joined Burke's team early in the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], transferring from the organized crime division. She is fascinated by [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], having written her thesis about him while at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]]. She assists with Neal and Peter's cases throughout the season, until being abruptly written out of the show between the first and second seasons.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Diana Barrigan===\nSpecial Agent Diana Barrigan ([[Marsha Thomason]]) is an FBI agent in the white collar crime unit, working under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. She first appeared in the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]] and was promoted to a main character beginning in \"[[Withdrawal (White Collar)|Withdrawal]]\" (2.01).\n\nDiana is one of the few people that Peter trusts implicitly, which contributes to her return to his team at the beginning of [[White Collar (season 2)|season two]]. She is the daughter of a diplomat, and spent much of her childhood in and out of hotel rooms. Her bodyguard, who greatly influenced her life (and through Diana, Neal's), was killed while protecting her. Diana is in a relationship with a woman named Christie, though it is strained because of Christie's reluctance to live in New York. Christie first appears in the third season episode \"Deadline\" played by [[Moran Atias]].\n\nDiana was absent for much of the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], as she transferred to the Washington, D.C. office for a desk job at the end of the pilot. However, she returns to New York in \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14) to help Peter investigate [[Garrett Fowler]], and eventually rejoins Peter's team.\n\nIn the second season, after the disappearance of the music box, it is shown to be in Diana's possession. Later, with the help of [[Alexandra Hunter|Alex Hunter]], Neal steals it.\n\nIn the season three episode \"Pulling Strings\" Diana announces that the couple is engaged to be married. Diana is apprehensive, since the possibility of getting legally married is something she never thought could happen.\n\nDiana reports that Christie and she have broken up in the [[List of White Collar episodes#Season 4 (2012.E2.80.9313)|season four]] episode \"Honor Among Thieves\", and reveals that she is pregnant, via [[sperm donor]], in the [[List of White Collar episodes#Season 5 (2013)|season five]] premiere, reflecting Marsha Thomason's real-life pregnancy.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Clinton Jones===\nSpecial Agent Clinton Jones ([[Sharif Atkins]]) is an FBI agent in the white collar crime division, working under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. He first appeared in the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]] and has appeared in every episode since. Atkins was added to the starring cast in the fourth season.\n\nJones attended [[Harvard Law School]] and later joined the FBI. While at Harvard he was engaged to a woman named Isabella, but she left Jones for his best friend Jimmy (shown in season 3 episode 8), whom she later married with Jones present at their wedding. Peter uses him often when researching a lead or when he is in need of backup. Jones often is forced to \"babysit\" [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] or do surveillance duty in the FBI van, which he does not enjoy. It is revealed in the episode \"As You Were\" (3.08) that Jones is trained in [[Eskrima|Kali]], is a [[U.S. Naval Academy]] graduate and chose a career in the FBI after his military commitment.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sara Ellis===\nSara Ellis ([[Hilarie Burton]]) is an insurance investigator for Sterling-Bosch who has a history with [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]]. Sara is a sharp, skilled investigator, and initially mistrustful of Neal. Over time, she becomes an increasingly important part of Peter's extended team, as she is slowly drawn into a romantic relationship with Neal until she finds out that Neal and Mozzie have been hiding the missing stolen art treasures from a [[World War II]] German [[U-Boat]] pursued by Neal's nemesis, Matthew Keller. She eventually forgives Neal when they are forced to work together, and they resume their relationship at the end of the third season.\n\nIn 3.14 it is revealed that Sara was engaged to her boss, whom she is investigating in the same episode, Brian McKenzie, but broke off the engagement when he wanted to extend Sterling-Bosch beyond insurance. Sara revealed that her older sister ran away when she was little (though in Season 2, Episode 5, she said she was an only child). She gave a statement in Neal's favor when agent Kramer pursued him. However, when Neal left without telling her goodbye, she was hurt as stated in 4.04, she felt as if she had lost a family member all over again. They resume their relationship until Sara gets a job offer in London.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Elizabeth Burke===\nElizabeth Burke ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]) is an event planner, and is married to [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. It is shown in [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]] that Peter followed her and did background checks in order to ask Elizabeth out (although unromantic, this mirrors real-life guidelines of the personal lives of law enforcement and intelligence agents). Elizabeth is a periodic \"consultant\" to the FBI and has assisted on various cases, using her professional activities as a convincing cover. She is even seen teaching Peter how to flirt with other women when he is going undercover, and on occasion demonstrates a cooler head in a crisis than her husband or Neal. She is kidnapped by Matthew Keller at the end of episode \"Countdown\" (3.10), but later escapes.\n\nElizabeth is a sisterly figure to [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] and has a special friendship with [[List of White Collar characters#Mozzie|Mozzie]] (he calls her \"Mrs. Suit\"). \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Rebecca Lowe/Rachel Turner===\nRebecca Lowe (real name Rachel Turner) ([[Bridget Regan]]) is [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] girlfriend in season five. Neal plans a con where they set up an art thief, a rival of Mozzie's, to steal a piece of art and then get caught while Neal copies a chapter in an old book. Neal meets Rebecca when he investigates the museum. She is later fired from the museum and believes that Neal is an FBI agent because of a con that Neal, Mozzie, and Neal's landlord set up to get more information about why the book chapter information is so valuable. Neal is fortunate that Peter thinks that Neal was only lying to Rebecca about his true job at the FBI to date her and does not know about the book when Peter crashes Neal and Rebecca's date. Neal later tells Rebecca the truth about him consulting on cases and why he needed the information and Rebecca locks the door and they proceed to have sex. Rebecca helps with the glass pane scheme in the mid-season finale. It is later discovered that she did professional recon on Peter, Elizabeth, Neal, David Siegel, and the rest of the White Collar unit. She also set up Hagen and killed him and Siegel. In the season six premiere, she helps the FBI and Peter to find Neal when he is kidnapped by her partner. After a brief conversation with Neal, she is escorted by the US Marshals back to maximum security, but decides to get herself killed by reaching for a gun on her way to the car.\n\n===June Ellington===\nJune Ellington ([[Diahann Carroll]]) is a widow who allows [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] to stay in her home.  Her husband, Byron, was a conman as well. June has a granddaughter named Cindy and a niece named Samantha. June first met Neal while in a thrift store when she offered him a room in her luxurious home where he stays throughout the series.  She becomes both a trusted friend and an integral part of many cases, both asking for and offering help (appearing in 27 episodes).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140792/?ref_=tt_cl_t10</ref>  She first displays her singing talents in \"Home Invasion\", and then she contributes to a case in \"Empire City\" by starring as the opening act at a jazz club under investigation. In the episode \"Power Play\", she helps teach Peter how to be a thief.\n\n===Kate Moreau===\nKate Moreau ([[Alexandra Daddario]]) was [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] girlfriend. Her disappearance and murder were the primary story arc throughout the first and second seasons. Kate first met Neal while working for [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]]. She began a relationship with Neal, who she believed was Nick Halden. Adler pulled a billion dollar Ponzi scheme and vanished, along with a lot of people's\u2014including Neal and Kate's\u2014money. Kate is later killed in a plane explosion, leaving Neal depressed and angry. It is later revealed that Vincent Adler was responsible for Kate's murder.\n\n===Matthew Keller===\nMatthew Keller ([[Ross McCall]]) is [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] blue-collar counterpart and nemesis. Unlike Neal, he is willing to murder to make a score. At the end of \"Countdown\" he kidnaps Elizabeth to force Peter to help him steal the submarine treasure from Neal, making things personal between Peter and him. In \"Checkmate\" Keller says that Elizabeth will be returned to Peter if he, Neal, and Mozzie help him steal the treasure. During this episode, it is revealed that Neal and Keller used to be close friends. Keller even seems somewhat upset that Neal doesn't seem to want to remember the \"good old days\".\n\n===Reese Hughes===\nSpecial Agent in Charge Reese Hughes ([[James Rebhorn]]) is an experienced agent in the FBI's white collar crime unit, and is [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]] and [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] direct superior.  Hughes is supportive of Peter's use of Neal, but is at first skeptical of the former conman, believing that he will eventually return to his criminal ways. However, as time passes, he begins to see Neal's value.\n\n===Garrett Fowler===\nFormer Special Agent Garrett Fowler ([[Noah Emmerich]]) is a disgraced agent from the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]]. He was once suspected to be the man behind [[Kate Moreau|Kate's]] death. Fowler headed Operation Mentor, which focused on taking down [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter Burke]].  It was also used to search for the music box.\n\nIt is also known that Fowler once had a wife who was later murdered; from this Fowler wanted revenge and subsequently went on to kill his late wife's killer. This was covered up by someone who is able to pull a lot of strings and he was transferred to OPR.\n\n===Alex Hunter===\nAlexandra Hunter ([[Gloria Votsis]]) is a high-end fence and an old lover and ally of [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]]. According to records that the FBI has on her, she has \"powerful friends\", and has only been arrested once\u2014in France.\n\nNeal met Alex while he worked for Vincent Adler. He singled her out and set her up in a meeting with Adler, where she was scared away. Alex later approached Neal, where he informed her that he 'would not apologize' for his actions, and that it was his job to catch her and her job to 'not get caught.' Alex then asks him out for drinks, where they eventually end up in Neal's bed. Afterwards, she tells him about the music box that Vince Adler wants, informing Neal that it was 'worth about as much' as the Holy Grail.\n\nAfter some time, Neal contacts her to do the music box job, but it ultimately fails and Neal is forced to leave Alex in a French hospital while he returned to New York.\n\nToward the end of the first season, Alex was given a plane ticket to Italy by the FBI, having helped Neal recover the elusive music box from the Italian consulate in Manhattan, because there was a 'target on her back'. During the episode 'Copycat Caffrey' she asks Neal for his help. She has been fencing gold Krugerrands in an effort to stay under the radar, but is about to be set up by one of Mozzie's contacts who is selling her out to the people who are hunting for Neal. After helping the FBI to recover a stolen painting and a case full of Krugerrands, Peter presents her with a ticket to Italy and she leaves the country, but not for long.\n\nEarly in the second season Alex returns to New York and helps Neal steal the music box again\u2014this time from Diana's personal safe, although his method to contact her involves forging an FBI case file and a clandestine meeting on a rooftop. He makes a comment that he doesn't have her phone number, and that it would be easier to contact her 'like a normal person' if she gave it to him. After Alex anonymously donates the music box to the Russians\u2014its rightful owners\u2014she meets Neal at his apartment and finally gives him her number before leaving.\n\nNeal is later reunited with Alex when Vincent Adler kidnaps them and Peter. With Alex hostage, Adler forced Neal and Peter to open the TNT-covered entrance to the German U-boat full of Nazi treasure. Once the three of them are saved by Peter's FBI team, Neal and Alex kiss, revealing that there is still some lingering romantic feelings between them.\n\n===Vincent Adler===\nVincent Adler ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) was the CEO of a massive hedge fund, believed to be the driving power behind [[#Kate Moreau|Kate's]] murder.

His girlfriend, [[Kate Moreau|Kate]], visits him in prison to break up with him. In order to get her back, he stages an elaborate prison break. Peter Burke, the agent who put Neal in prison to begin with, quickly catches up with Neal, where it is revealed that Kate has left only a bottle of [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] behind at their apartment. Neal is quickly brought back to prison, where he is told he will have to serve four more years. After helping Peter and his team find an elusive criminal, the Dutchman ([[Mark Sheppard]]), Neal is released on the condition that he wear an [[ankle monitor]] that records his movements. He easily finds lodging with an elderly woman, [[June (White Collar)|June]], and the two quickly become close.\n\nThroughout the series, Neal helps the FBI solve difficult cases, using his vast knowledge of white collar crime. He is a skilled thief and art forger, among other criminal activities. Neal uses his position at the FBI in order to get closer to Kate; however, after her death, he uses it to find her killer.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Neal spends much of his time researching Kate's disappearance. With the help of his best friend, [[Mozzie (White Collar)|Mozzie]], Neal learns that Kate was taken by a man with an FBI ring. After discovering that Peter had visited her, Neal believes that Peter is the man behind her disappearance. This causes a strain on their relationship, though it eventually recovers. Neal finds that in order to free Kate, he must find the music box. He recruits an old friend, [[Alexandra Hunter|Alex Hunter]], to do so in \"[[Home Invasion (White Collar)|Home Invasion]]\" (1.11). The two continue to search over the next several episodes. In \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14), after Neal locates Kate, who has boarded an airplane, he witnesses her death.\n\nOver the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Neal reveals much about his past. In \"[[Forging Bonds]]\" (2.11), he tells Peter that his first con with Mozzie involved a man named [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]]. Adler introduced Neal to Kate, and the two quickly began a relationship. Months later, Neal and Kate discovered that Adler had been caught running a Ponzi scheme, and they lost all of their money. After Kate realized that Neal was conning her as well, she left him and began running her own cons. However, Neal found her. After the two confessed their love, Neal was arrested (for the first time) by Peter. Back in the present day, Neal meets an insurance investigator named [[#Sara Ellis|Sara Ellis]]. At first, Sara tries to have Neal arrested for the theft of a painting. However, the two, who have a history, eventually begin dating. Upon Adler's return and defeat in \"[[Under the Radar (White Collar)|Under the Radar]]\", Mozzie's machinations to steal the U-boat treasures lead to Peter suspecting that Neal had conned him into leading him to the treasure. Neal, upset over Peter's decided lack in trust in him, simply demands for him to prove it.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, Neal has been recommended for a possible commutation due to his part in capturing super evil-doer, Matthew Keller. Keller kidnapped Peter\u2019s wife Elizabeth ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]) in order to ransom a treasure Neal and his fellow con, Mozzie ([[Willie Garson]]), had in their possession. Peter and Diana spent much of last season trying to find out if Neal had the treasure and Peter is justifiably pissed off that a psychopath has snatched his wife to get it. Neal and Mozzie are ready to give up the treasure for Elizabeth and Neal and Peter work on some bromance trust issues while trying to stall Keller long enough for Diana and Jones to locate Elizabeth. Because Keller confesses to stealing the treasure, Neal doesn\u2019t go to prison and is offered a chance at freedom. The rest of the season turns into a test of Neal\u2019s trustworthiness with each case they solve, and how they solve it, weighing on Peter\u2019s mind as he decides what to tell the hearing panel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hallowell|first1=Lucy|title=\"White Collar\" Season 3 Recap: What Diana\u2019s been up to|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/99150-white-collar-season-3-recap-what-dianas-been-up-to|website=AfterEllen|publisher=AfterEllen}}</ref>\n\n===Peter Burke===\n[[Special agent|Special Agent in Charge]]<ref name=parting>{{Cite episode |title=Parting Shots |episodelink=List of White Collar episodes |series=White Collar |network=[[USA Network]] |date=July 31, 2012 |season=4 |number=4 |minutes=c. 40 |quote=It is our recommendation that he [Peter Burke] be reinstated as Special Agent in Charge of the Manhattan White Collar Division effective immediately.}}</ref> Peter Burke ([[Tim DeKay]]) is an [[FBI]] agent, and the head of the Manhattan White Collar Division.<ref name=parting/> He is married to [[Elizabeth Burke (White Collar)|Elizabeth]] and is the direct superior of [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], [[Diana Barrigan|Diana]], and [[Clinton Jones (White Collar)|Jones]]. He has a dog named Satchmo.\n\nPeter is a no-nonsense, by-the-book agent, who is extremely devoted to his wife. After teaming up with Neal, he is forced to enter various awkward situations, including flirting with other women and assuming various aliases (including, in one case, Neal Caffrey). However, Peter still upholds high moral and ethical standards.\n\nIn the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]], it is shown that Peter has been working the Neal Caffrey case for several years. After spending three years attempting to catch Neal, he finally did, and Neal went to prison for almost four years. However, Neal escaped from prison. This time, Peter easily caught him, finding him at the apartment he had shared with [[Kate Moreau|Kate]]. Over the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Peter warns Neal, on various occasions, not to investigate Kate's disappearance, as it could cause him to slip back into his criminal ways. The two catch various white collar criminals together, including thieves, murderers, and other conmen.\n\nIn a third season episode, it is revealed that Peter has an astronomy hobby which was put to good use to solve a case involving an [[astronomical]] puzzle involving a kidnapper using an inheritance as a ransom. In another third season episode, Burke is revealed to be a Yankee and a former American baseball player. His brief career stopped only because of an injury.\n\nBy the end of the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Peter discovers that Neal may have been conning him from the very beginning and has very high suspicions that Neal stole the submarine treasure. In the third season summer finale, things between Peter and Matthew Keller become very personal when Keller kidnaps Elizabeth to force Peter to help him steal the treasure from Neal.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 3)|third season]] Peter acknowledges his [[Scouting in popular culture#Fictional Eagle Scouts|Eagle Scout]] rank responding to his wife, \"Yeah, Eagle Scout, always be prepared\" when asked about having the will in his pocket.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Where There's a Will |series=White Collar |network=USA Network |date=July 14, 2011 |season=3 |number=2 |transcript=Elizabeth: \"You just happened to have the will in your pocket?\"  Peter: \"Yeah, Eagle Scout, always be prepared.\"}}</ref> Peter also informs Neal that after college he was drafted into minor league baseball as a pitcher. He later quit this after a serious injury occurred during his second week there.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn Season six, Elizabeth becomes pregnant and in the series finale has their son, whom they name Neal.\n\n===Mozzie===\nMozzie ([[Willie Garson]]) is a close friend to [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], and a fellow conman. He is characterized by his quirky qualities and generally mysterious nature.\n\nMozzie first met Neal while they were independent conmen, as shown through flashbacks in \"[[Forging Bonds]]\" (2.11). The two set up a long con on a man named [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]], though the plan eventually failed.\n\nThroughout the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], Mozzie uses his various connections to the criminal world to help Neal with both his investigations with [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]] and his private investigation into [[Kate Moreau|Kate's]] disappearance. Mozzie is very distrusting of the FBI, and doesn't even meet Peter until mid-way through the season. After their first encounter, Peter refers to Mozzie as \"Neal's friend\", and Mozzie refers to Peter and [[Elizabeth Burke (White Collar)|Elizabeth]] as \"Suit\" and \"Mrs. Suit\". He goes on to form a very close friendship with Elizabeth which Peter finds both amusing and questionable.\n\nDuring the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]], Mozzie becomes more involved with the FBI, especially when a close friend and romantic interest of his, Gina, is kidnapped in \"[[By the Book (White Collar)|By the Book]]\" (2.04). He also becomes much more involved with the investigation into Kate's murder, discovering the identity of the last person Kate spoke to (Fowler) and breaking the code of the music box. However, in \"[[Point Blank (White Collar)|Point Blank]]\" (2.09), Mozzie is shot and left for dead, before he can tell anyone the meaning of the music box code. He barely survives, and later joins Burke's Seven (in the episode [[Burke's Seven|of the same name]]) to take down the man who shot him. Eventually, he and Neal discover that the man who shot him is involved with [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]], the man behind Kate's death.\n{{Clear}}\n\nIn the [[White Collar (season 3)|third season]], it is revealed that Mozzie was abandoned on the doorstep of an orphanage with a stuffed bear named Mozart. Unable to pronounce the name \"Mozart\", he used to call the Bear \"Mozzie\". He kept the bear with him even after he ran to New York to escape the Detroit Mob, and he named himself after it. He had to leave Detroit because he conned the local mob boss there. It was also revealed that he is the famed Dentist of Detroit, this all occurred when Mozzie was the age of twelve years, which shocks and impresses both Neal and Peter.\n\nIn \"Out of the Frying Pan\" (5.2), it is revealed that Mozzie's real name is Theodore (Teddy) Winters.\n\n===Lauren Cruz===\nSpecial Agent Lauren Cruz ([[Natalie Morales (actress)|Natalie Morales]]) is an FBI agent who briefly worked in the white collar crime unit under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. She transferred to his team in \"[[Threads (White Collar)|Threads]]\" (1.02) and left after the events of \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14).  Morales left the show before production of the [[White Collar (season 2)|second season]].\n\nLauren joined Burke's team early in the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], transferring from the organized crime division. She is fascinated by [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]], having written her thesis about him while at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]]. She assists with Neal and Peter's cases throughout the season, until being abruptly written out of the show between the first and second seasons.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Diana Barrigan===\nSpecial Agent Diana Barrigan ([[Marsha Thomason]]) is an FBI agent in the white collar crime unit, working under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. She first appeared in the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]] and was promoted to a main character beginning in \"[[Withdrawal (White Collar)|Withdrawal]]\" (2.01).\n\nDiana is one of the few people that Peter trusts implicitly, which contributes to her return to his team at the beginning of [[White Collar (season 2)|season two]]. She is the daughter of a diplomat, and spent much of her childhood in and out of hotel rooms. Her bodyguard, who greatly influenced her life (and through Diana, Neal's), was killed while protecting her. Diana is in a relationship with a woman named Christie, though it is strained because of Christie's reluctance to live in New York. Christie first appears in the third season episode \"Deadline\" played by [[Moran Atias]].\n\nDiana was absent for much of the [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]], as she transferred to the Washington, D.C. office for a desk job at the end of the pilot. However, she returns to New York in \"[[Out of the Box (White Collar)|Out of the Box]]\" (1.14) to help Peter investigate [[Garrett Fowler]], and eventually rejoins Peter's team.\n\nIn the second season, after the disappearance of the music box, it is shown to be in Diana's possession. Later, with the help of [[Alexandra Hunter|Alex Hunter]], Neal steals it.\n\nIn the season three episode \"Pulling Strings\" Diana announces that the couple is engaged to be married. Diana is apprehensive, since the possibility of getting legally married is something she never thought could happen.\n\nDiana reports that Christie and she have broken up in the [[List of White Collar episodes#Season 4 (2012.E2.80.9313)|season four]] episode \"Honor Among Thieves\", and reveals that she is pregnant, via [[sperm donor]], in the [[List of White Collar episodes#Season 5 (2013)|season five]] premiere, reflecting Marsha Thomason's real-life pregnancy.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Clinton Jones===\nSpecial Agent Clinton Jones ([[Sharif Atkins]]) is an FBI agent in the white collar crime division, working under [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. He first appeared in the [[Pilot (White Collar)|pilot episode]] and has appeared in every episode since. Atkins was added to the starring cast in the fourth season.\n\nJones attended [[Harvard Law School]] and later joined the FBI. While at Harvard he was engaged to a woman named Isabella, but she left Jones for his best friend Jimmy (shown in season 3 episode 8), whom she later married with Jones present at their wedding. Peter uses him often when researching a lead or when he is in need of backup. Jones often is forced to \"babysit\" [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] or do surveillance duty in the FBI van, which he does not enjoy. It is revealed in the episode \"As You Were\" (3.08) that Jones is trained in [[Eskrima|Kali]], is a [[U.S. Naval Academy]] graduate and chose a career in the FBI after his military commitment.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Sara Ellis===\nSara Ellis ([[Hilarie Burton]]) is an insurance investigator for Sterling-Bosch who has a history with [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]]. Sara is a sharp, skilled investigator, and initially mistrustful of Neal. Over time, she becomes an increasingly important part of Peter's extended team, as she is slowly drawn into a romantic relationship with Neal until she finds out that Neal and Mozzie have been hiding the missing stolen art treasures from a [[World War II]] German [[U-Boat]] pursued by Neal's nemesis, Matthew Keller. She eventually forgives Neal when they are forced to work together, and they resume their relationship at the end of the third season.\n\nIn 3.14 it is revealed that Sara was engaged to her boss, whom she is investigating in the same episode, Brian McKenzie, but broke off the engagement when he wanted to extend Sterling-Bosch beyond insurance. Sara revealed that her older sister ran away when she was little (though in Season 2, Episode 5, she said she was an only child). She gave a statement in Neal's favor when agent Kramer pursued him. However, when Neal left without telling her goodbye, she was hurt as stated in 4.04, she felt as if she had lost a family member all over again. They resume their relationship until Sara gets a job offer in London.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Elizabeth Burke===\nElizabeth Burke ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]) is an event planner, and is married to [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]]. It is shown in [[White Collar (season 1)|first season]] that Peter followed her and did background checks in order to ask Elizabeth out (although unromantic, this mirrors real-life guidelines of the personal lives of law enforcement and intelligence agents). Elizabeth is a periodic \"consultant\" to the FBI and has assisted on various cases, using her professional activities as a convincing cover. She is even seen teaching Peter how to flirt with other women when he is going undercover, and on occasion demonstrates a cooler head in a crisis than her husband or Neal. She is kidnapped by Matthew Keller at the end of episode \"Countdown\" (3.10), but later escapes.\n\nElizabeth is a sisterly figure to [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] and has a special friendship with [[List of White Collar characters#Mozzie|Mozzie]] (he calls her \"Mrs. Suit\"). \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Rebecca Lowe/Rachel Turner===\nRebecca Lowe (real name Rachel Turner) ([[Bridget Regan]]) is [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] girlfriend in season five. Neal plans a con where they set up an art thief, a rival of Mozzie's, to steal a piece of art and then get caught while Neal copies a chapter in an old book. Neal meets Rebecca when he investigates the museum. She is later fired from the museum and believes that Neal is an FBI agent because of a con that Neal, Mozzie, and Neal's landlord set up to get more information about why the book chapter information is so valuable. Neal is fortunate that Peter thinks that Neal was only lying to Rebecca about his true job at the FBI to date her and does not know about the book when Peter crashes Neal and Rebecca's date. Neal later tells Rebecca the truth about him consulting on cases and why he needed the information and Rebecca locks the door and they proceed to have sex. Rebecca helps with the glass pane scheme in the mid-season finale. It is later discovered that she did professional recon on Peter, Elizabeth, Neal, David Siegel, and the rest of the White Collar unit. She also set up Hagen and killed him and Siegel. In the season six premiere, she helps the FBI and Peter to find Neal when he is kidnapped by her partner. After a brief conversation with Neal, she is escorted by the US Marshals back to maximum security, but decides to get herself killed by reaching for a gun on her way to the car.\n\n===June Ellington===\nJune Ellington ([[Diahann Carroll]]) is a widow who allows [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]] to stay in her home.  Her husband, Byron, was a conman as well. June has a granddaughter named Cindy and a niece named Samantha. June first met Neal while in a thrift store when she offered him a room in her luxurious home where he stays throughout the series.  She becomes both a trusted friend and an integral part of many cases, both asking for and offering help (appearing in 27 episodes).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140792/?ref_=tt_cl_t10</ref>  She first displays her singing talents in \"Home Invasion\", and then she contributes to a case in \"Empire City\" by starring as the opening act at a jazz club under investigation. In the episode \"Power Play\", she helps teach Peter how to be a thief.\n\n===Kate Moreau===\nKate Moreau ([[Alexandra Daddario]]) was [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] girlfriend. Her disappearance and murder were the primary story arc throughout the first and second seasons. Kate first met Neal while working for [[#Vincent Adler|Vincent Adler]]. She began a relationship with Neal, who she believed was Nick Halden. Adler pulled a billion dollar Ponzi scheme and vanished, along with a lot of people's\u2014including Neal and Kate's\u2014money. Kate is later killed in a plane explosion, leaving Neal depressed and angry. It is later revealed that Vincent Adler was responsible for Kate's murder.\n\n===Matthew Keller===\nMatthew Keller ([[Ross McCall]]) is [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] blue-collar counterpart and nemesis. Unlike Neal, he is willing to murder to make a score. At the end of \"Countdown\" he kidnaps Elizabeth to force Peter to help him steal the submarine treasure from Neal, making things personal between Peter and him. In \"Checkmate\" Keller says that Elizabeth will be returned to Peter if he, Neal, and Mozzie help him steal the treasure. During this episode, it is revealed that Neal and Keller used to be close friends. Keller even seems somewhat upset that Neal doesn't seem to want to remember the \"good old days\".\n\n===Reese Hughes===\nSpecial Agent in Charge Reese Hughes ([[James Rebhorn]]) is an experienced agent in the FBI's white collar crime unit, and is [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter]] and [[Neal Caffrey|Neal's]] direct superior.

However, as time passes, he begins to see Neal's value.\n\n===Garrett Fowler===\nFormer Special Agent Garrett Fowler ([[Noah Emmerich]]) is a disgraced agent from the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]]. He was once suspected to be the man behind [[Kate Moreau|Kate's]] death. Fowler headed Operation Mentor, which focused on taking down [[Peter Burke (White Collar)|Peter Burke]].  It was also used to search for the music box.\n\nIt is also known that Fowler once had a wife who was later murdered; from this Fowler wanted revenge and subsequently went on to kill his late wife's killer. This was covered up by someone who is able to pull a lot of strings and he was transferred to OPR.\n\n===Alex Hunter===\nAlexandra Hunter ([[Gloria Votsis]]) is a high-end fence and an old lover and ally of [[Neal Caffrey|Neal]]. According to records that the FBI has on her, she has \"powerful friends\", and has only been arrested once\u2014in France.\n\nNeal met Alex while he worked for Vincent Adler. He singled her out and set her up in a meeting with Adler, where she was scared away. Alex later approached Neal, where he informed her that he 'would not apologize' for his actions, and that it was his job to catch her and her job to 'not get caught.' Alex then asks him out for drinks, where they eventually end up in Neal's bed. Afterwards, she tells him about the music box that Vince Adler wants, informing Neal that it was 'worth about as much' as the Holy Grail.\n\nAfter some time, Neal contacts her to do the music box job, but it ultimately fails and Neal is forced to leave Alex in a French hospital while he returned to New York.\n\nToward the end of the first season, Alex was given a plane ticket to Italy by the FBI, having helped Neal recover the elusive music box from the Italian consulate in Manhattan, because there was a 'target on her back'. During the episode 'Copycat Caffrey' she asks Neal for his help. She has been fencing gold Krugerrands in an effort to stay under the radar, but is about to be set up by one of Mozzie's contacts who is selling her out to the people who are hunting for Neal. After helping the FBI to recover a stolen painting and a case full of Krugerrands, Peter presents her with a ticket to Italy and she leaves the country, but not for long.\n\nEarly in the second season Alex returns to New York and helps Neal steal the music box again\u2014this time from Diana's personal safe, although his method to contact her involves forging an FBI case file and a clandestine meeting on a rooftop. He makes a comment that he doesn't have her phone number, and that it would be easier to contact her 'like a normal person' if she gave it to him. After Alex anonymously donates the music box to the Russians\u2014its rightful owners\u2014she meets Neal at his apartment and finally gives him her number before leaving.\n\nNeal is later reunited with Alex when Vincent Adler kidnaps them and Peter. With Alex hostage, Adler forced Neal and Peter to open the TNT-covered entrance to the German U-boat full of Nazi treasure. Once the three of them are saved by Peter's FBI team, Neal and Alex kiss, revealing that there is still some lingering romantic feelings between them.\n\n===Vincent Adler===\nVincent Adler ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) was the CEO of a massive hedge fund, believed to be the driving power behind [[#Kate Moreau|Kate's]] murder. Neal tells Peter that he first learned of Adler from Mozzie when Neal and Mozzie planned a long-con: to infiltrate Adler's organization and take him down. Peter and Neal later realize that Adler is \"the man pulling the strings\".  He is the person responsible for Kate's death. Adler is eventually killed by [[#Peter Burke|Peter Burke]] in order to save Neal's life.\n\n== Minor characters ==\n* {{Anchor|Cindy}}Cindy ([[Denise Vasi]]) is [[June (White Collar)|June's]] granddaughter.

The most recent such system is the internationally recognised [[International System of Units]] (SI).\n\nMetric systems have developed to comply with the following basic concepts. There should be a single [[base unit (measurement)|base unit]] of measure for quantities of each of the fundamental dimensions of nature (e.g. the metre is the base unit for length). To measure quantities derived from the fundamental dimensions, units [[SI derived unit|derived]] from the base units should be used (e.g. the square metre is the derived unit for area, a quantity derived from length). For the sake of universality, the base unit standards should be [[realisation (metrology)|realisable]] anywhere from natural phenomena, rather than having to be copied from a single centralised standard physical artefact. A set of standard [[SI prefix|prefixes]] should be used to define units which are decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the base and derived units. No conversion factors should be required to convert between units, thus ensuring [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherence]].\n\n<!-- Here, perhaps, a list of short descriptions of each of the main metric systems --> \nMetric systems have evolved since the 1790s as science and technology has evolved, to provide a single universal measuring system which can be used for all measurement applications.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:BIPM courtyard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Pavillon de Breteuil]], Saint-Cloud, France, the home of the metric system since 1875]]\nThe [[French revolution]] (1789-99) provided an opportunity for the French to reform their unwieldy and archaic system of weights and measures. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]] championed a new system based on natural units, proposing to the [[French National Assembly]] in 1790 that such a system be developed. Talleyrand had ambitions that a new natural and standardised system would be embraced worldwide, and was keen to involve other countries in its development. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] ignored invitations to co-operate, so the [[French Academy of Sciences]] decided in 1791 to go it alone and they set up a commission for the purpose. The commission decided that the standard of length should be based on the size of the Earth. They defined that length to be the 'metre' and its length as one ten-millionth of the length of a quadrant on the Earth's surface from the equator to the north pole. In 1799, after the length of that quadrant had been surveyed, the new system was launched in France.<ref name=\"McGreevy\" />{{rp|145-149}}\n\nThe units of the metric system, originally taken from observable features of nature, are now defined by seven [[physical constant]]s being given exact numerical values in terms of the units.  In the modern form of the International System of Units (SI), the seven [[base unit (measurement)|base units]] are: ''[[metre]]'' for length, ''[[kilogram]]'' for mass, ''[[second]]'' for time, ''[[ampere]]'' for electric current, ''[[kelvin]]'' for temperature, ''[[candela]]'' for luminous intensity and ''[[Mole (unit)|mole]]'' for amount of substance. These, together with their derived units, can measure any physical quantity.  Derived units may have their own unit name, such as the [[watt]] (J/s) and [[lux]] (cd/m<sup>2</sup>), or may just be expressed as combinations of base units, such as velocity (m/s) and acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=SI2019>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf|title=The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition|last=|first=|date=2019|website=|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable, including units based on the natural world, decimal ratios, prefixes for multiples and sub-multiples, and a structure of base and derived units.  It is also a [[coherent system]], which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities.  It has a property called ''rationalisation'' that eliminates certain [[Proportionality (mathematics)|constants of proportionality]] in equations of physics.\n\nThe metric system is extensible, and new derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry.  For example, the [[katal]], a derived unit for catalytic activity equivalent to a one mole per second (1&nbsp;mol/s), was added in 1999.\n\n== Principles ==\nAlthough the metric system has changed and developed since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of [[units of measurement]], now known as [[base units]]. [[Derived units]] were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a [[SI prefixes|standard set of prefixes]].\n\n===Realisation===\n{{See also|Realisation (metrology)}}\n[[File:Kilometre definition.svg|pic|right|thumb|The '''metre''' was originally defined to be one ten millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] through Paris.<ref name=Alder />]]\nThe base units used in a measurement system must be [[Realisation (metrology)|realisable]]. Each of the definitions of the base units in the SI is accompanied by a defined ''mise en pratique'' [practical realisation] that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be measured.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/new_si/mise-en-pratique.html |title = What is a ''mise en pratique''? |publisher = [[BIPM]] |year=2011 |accessdate = 11 March 2011}}</ref> Where possible, definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country.  In practice, such realisation is done under the auspices of a [[International Organization of Legal Metrology#Conformance Certification|mutual acceptance arrangement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiml.org/maa/ |title=OIML Mutual Acceptance Arrangement (MAA) |publisher=[[International Organisation of Legal Metrology]] |accessdate=23 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521131225/http://www.oiml.org/maa/ |archivedate=21 May 2013}}</ref> His follow my tik tok @james.filipovic\n\n\nIn the SI, the standard [[metre]] is defined as exactly 1/299,792,458 of the distance that light travels in a [[second]]. The realisation of the metre depends in turn on precise realisation of the second. There are both astronomical observation methods and laboratory measurement methods that are used to realise units of the standard metre. Because the speed of [[light]] is now exactly defined in terms of the metre, more precise measurement of the speed of light does not result in a more accurate figure for its velocity in standard units, but rather a more accurate definition of the metre. The accuracy of the measured speed of light is considered to be within 1&nbsp;m/s, and the realisation of the metre is within about 3 parts in 1,000,000,000, or a proportion of 0.3x10<sup>\u22128</sup>:1.\n\nThe [[kilogram]] was originally defined as the mass of a man-made artefact of platinum-iridium held in a laboratory in France, until the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|new definition was introduced in May 2019]]. Replicas made in 1879 at the time of the artefact's fabrication and distributed to signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] serve as ''de facto'' standards of mass in those countries. Additional replicas have been fabricated since as additional countries have joined the convention.  The replicas were subject to periodic validation by comparison to the original, called the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram|IPK]]. It became apparent that either the IPK or the replicas or both were deteriorating, and are no longer comparable: they had diverged by 50&nbsp;\u03bcg since fabrication, so figuratively, the accuracy of the kilogram was no better than 5 parts in a hundred million or a proportion of 5x10<sup>\u22128</sup>:1. The accepted redefinition of SI base units replaced the IPK with an exact definition of the [[Planck constant]], which defines the kilogram in terms of the second and metre.\n\n===Base and derived unit structure===\n{{main|Base unit (measurement)}}\n{{see also|SI derived unit}}\nThe metric system base units were originally adopted because they represented fundamental orthogonal dimensions of measurement corresponding to how we perceive nature: a spatial dimension, a time dimension, one for inertia, and later, a more subtle one for the dimension of an \"invisible substance\" known as electricity or more generally, electromagnetism. One and only one unit in each of these dimensions was defined, unlike older systems where multiple perceptual quantities with the same dimension were prevalent, like inches, feet and yards or ounces, pounds and tons. Units for other quantities like area and volume, which are also spatial dimensional quantities, were derived from the fundamental ones by logical relationships, so that a unit of square area for example, was the unit of length squared.\n\nMany derived units were already in use before and during the time the metric system evolved, because they represented convenient abstractions of whatever base units were defined for the system, especially in the sciences. So analogous units were scaled in terms of the units of the newly established metric system, and their names adopted into the system. Many of these were associated with electromagnetism.  Other perceptual units, like volume, which were not defined in terms of base units, were incorporated into the system with definitions in the metric base units, so that the system remained simple. It grew in number of units, but the system retained a uniform structure.\n\n=== Decimal ratios ===\nSome customary systems of weights and measures had duodecimal ratios, which meant quantities were conveniently divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.  But it was difficult to do arithmetic with things like {{frac|1|4}} pound or {{frac|1|3}} foot. There was no system of notation for successive fractions: for example, {{frac|1|3}} of {{frac|1|3}} of a foot was not an inch or any other unit. But the system of counting in decimal ratios did have notation, and the system had the algebraic property of multiplicative closure: a fraction of a fraction, or a multiple of a fraction was a quantity in the system, like {{frac|1|10}} of {{frac|1|10}} which is {{frac|1|100}}. So a decimal radix became the ratio between unit sizes of the metric system.\n\n=== Prefixes for multiples and submultiples ===\n{{Main|Metric prefix}}\nIn the metric system, multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern.<ref group = Note>Non-SI units for time and plane angle measurement, inherited from existing systems, are an exception to the decimal-multiplier rule</ref>\n{{common metric prefixes}}\nA common set of decimal-based prefixes that have the effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use. The concept of using consistent classical ([[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) names for the prefixes was first proposed in a report by the [[French Revolution]]ary Commission on Weights and Measures in May 1793.<ref name=Alder>{{cite book\n|title = The Measure of all Things\u2014The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World\n|last= Alder\n|first= Ken\n|year= 2002\n|publisher= Abacus\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-349-11507-8}}</ref>{{rp|89\u201396}} The prefix ''kilo'', for example, is used to multiply the unit by 1000, and the prefix ''milli'' is to indicate a one-thousandth part of the unit. Thus the ''[[kilogram]]'' and ''[[kilometre]]'' are a thousand [[gram]]s and [[metre]]s respectively, and a ''[[milligram]]'' and ''[[millimetre]]'' are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively. These relations can be written symbolically as:<ref name=SI_prefix>{{SIbrochure8th|pages=121,122}}</ref>\n{{block indent|1=1&nbsp;mg = 0.001&nbsp;g}}\n{{block indent|1=1&nbsp;km = 1000&nbsp;m}}\n\nIn the early days, multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given Greek-derived prefixes such as  ''kilo-'' and ''mega-'', and those that were negative powers of ten were given Latin-derived prefixes such as ''centi-'' and ''milli-''. However, 1935 extensions to the prefix system did not follow this convention: the prefixes ''nano-'' and ''micro-'', for example have Greek roots.<ref name=\"McGreevy\">{{cite book\n|title = The Basis of Measurement: Volume 2\u2014Metrication and Current Practice\n|isbn = 978-0-948251-84-9\n|publisher = Picton Publishing\n|location = Chippenham\n|year = 1997\n|first1 = Thomas\n|last1 = McGreevy\n|editor1-first = Peter\n|editor1-last = Cunningham}}</ref>{{rp|222\u2013223}} During the 19th century the prefix [[Non-SI unit prefix#Obsolete prefixes|''myria-'']], derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 (''m\u00fdrioi''), was used as a multiplier for {{val|10000}}.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://archive.org/details/edinburghencyclo07brew\n|title=The Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\n|first1=D\n|last1=Brewster\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/edinburghencyclo07brew/page/494 494]\n|year=1830\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed, the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix, as illustrated below.<ref name=SI_prefix />\n{| style=\"margin-left:3em !important; white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n|1&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> (square millimetre)         ||= (1&nbsp;mm)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;||= (0.001&nbsp;m)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;||= {{val|0.000001|u=m2}}\n|-\n|1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> ([[square kilometre]])&nbsp;||= (1&nbsp;km)<sup>2</sup>      ||= (1000&nbsp;m)<sup>2</sup>       ||= {{val|1000000|u=m2}}\n|-\n|1&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup> (cubic millimetre)          ||= (1&nbsp;mm)<sup>3</sup>      ||= (0.001&nbsp;m)<sup>3</sup>      ||= {{val|0.000000001|u=m3}}\n|-\n|1&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (cubic kilometre)           ||= (1&nbsp;km)<sup>3</sup>      ||= (1000&nbsp;m)<sup>3</sup>       ||= {{val|1000000000|u=m3}}\n|}\n\nPrefixes are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than 1; the non-SI units of [[minute]], [[hour]] and [[day]] are used instead.

It also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power (watt) and irradience (lumen). Electrical units were taken from the International system then in use.  Other units like those for energy (joule) were modelled on those from the older CGS system, but scaled to be coherent with MKSA units. Two additional base units, ''degree Kelvin'' equivalent to degree Celsius for thermodynamic temperature, and ''candela'', roughly equivalent to the [[international candle]] unit of illumination, were introduced. Later, another base unit, the ''mole'', a unit of mass equivalent to Avogadro's number of specified molecules, was added along with several other derived units.\n\nThe system was promulgated by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: ''Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures'' \u2013 CGPM) in 1960.  At that time, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line of the [[krypton-86]]<ref group=Note>A stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally</ref> atom, and the standard metre artefact from 1889 was retired.\n\nToday, the International system of units consists of 7 base units and innumerable coherent derived units including 22 with special names. The last new derived unit, the ''katal'' for catalytic activity, was added in 1999. Some of the base units are now realised in terms of invariant constants of physics. As a consequence, the speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant, and defines the metre as {{frac|299,792,458}} of the distance light travels in a second. [[2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units#Kilogram|Until 2019]], the kilogram was defined by a man-made artefact of deteriorating platinum-iridium.

The most recent such system is the internationally recognised [[International System of Units]] (SI).\n\nMetric systems have developed to comply with the following basic concepts. There should be a single [[base unit (measurement)|base unit]] of measure for quantities of each of the fundamental dimensions of nature (e.g. the metre is the base unit for length). To measure quantities derived from the fundamental dimensions, units [[SI derived unit|derived]] from the base units should be used (e.g. the square metre is the derived unit for area, a quantity derived from length). For the sake of universality, the base unit standards should be [[realisation (metrology)|realisable]] anywhere from natural phenomena, rather than having to be copied from a single centralised standard physical artefact. A set of standard [[SI prefix|prefixes]] should be used to define units which are decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the base and derived units. No conversion factors should be required to convert between units, thus ensuring [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherence]].\n\n<!-- Here, perhaps, a list of short descriptions of each of the main metric systems --> \nMetric systems have evolved since the 1790s as science and technology has evolved, to provide a single universal measuring system which can be used for all measurement applications.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:BIPM courtyard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Pavillon de Breteuil]], Saint-Cloud, France, the home of the metric system since 1875]]\nThe [[French revolution]] (1789-99) provided an opportunity for the French to reform their unwieldy and archaic system of weights and measures. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]] championed a new system based on natural units, proposing to the [[French National Assembly]] in 1790 that such a system be developed. Talleyrand had ambitions that a new natural and standardised system would be embraced worldwide, and was keen to involve other countries in its development. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] ignored invitations to co-operate, so the [[French Academy of Sciences]] decided in 1791 to go it alone and they set up a commission for the purpose. The commission decided that the standard of length should be based on the size of the Earth. They defined that length to be the 'metre' and its length as one ten-millionth of the length of a quadrant on the Earth's surface from the equator to the north pole. In 1799, after the length of that quadrant had been surveyed, the new system was launched in France.<ref name=\"McGreevy\" />{{rp|145-149}}\n\nThe units of the metric system, originally taken from observable features of nature, are now defined by seven [[physical constant]]s being given exact numerical values in terms of the units.  In the modern form of the International System of Units (SI), the seven [[base unit (measurement)|base units]] are: ''[[metre]]'' for length, ''[[kilogram]]'' for mass, ''[[second]]'' for time, ''[[ampere]]'' for electric current, ''[[kelvin]]'' for temperature, ''[[candela]]'' for luminous intensity and ''[[Mole (unit)|mole]]'' for amount of substance. These, together with their derived units, can measure any physical quantity.  Derived units may have their own unit name, such as the [[watt]] (J/s) and [[lux]] (cd/m<sup>2</sup>), or may just be expressed as combinations of base units, such as velocity (m/s) and acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=SI2019>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si-brochure/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf|title=The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition|last=|first=|date=2019|website=|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable, including units based on the natural world, decimal ratios, prefixes for multiples and sub-multiples, and a structure of base and derived units.  It is also a [[coherent system]], which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities.  It has a property called ''rationalisation'' that eliminates certain [[Proportionality (mathematics)|constants of proportionality]] in equations of physics.\n\nThe metric system is extensible, and new derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry.  For example, the [[katal]], a derived unit for catalytic activity equivalent to a one mole per second (1&nbsp;mol/s), was added in 1999.\n\n== Principles ==\nAlthough the metric system has changed and developed since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of [[units of measurement]], now known as [[base units]]. [[Derived units]] were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a [[SI prefixes|standard set of prefixes]].\n\n===Realisation===\n{{See also|Realisation (metrology)}}\n[[File:Kilometre definition.svg|pic|right|thumb|The '''metre''' was originally defined to be one ten millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] through Paris.<ref name=Alder />]]\nThe base units used in a measurement system must be [[Realisation (metrology)|realisable]]. Each of the definitions of the base units in the SI is accompanied by a defined ''mise en pratique'' [practical realisation] that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be measured.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/new_si/mise-en-pratique.html |title = What is a ''mise en pratique''? |publisher = [[BIPM]] |year=2011 |accessdate = 11 March 2011}}</ref> Where possible, definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country.  In practice, such realisation is done under the auspices of a [[International Organization of Legal Metrology#Conformance Certification|mutual acceptance arrangement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oiml.org/maa/ |title=OIML Mutual Acceptance Arrangement (MAA) |publisher=[[International Organisation of Legal Metrology]] |accessdate=23 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521131225/http://www.oiml.org/maa/ |archivedate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the SI, the standard [[metre]] is defined as exactly 1/299,792,458 of the distance that light travels in a [[second]]. The realisation of the metre depends in turn on precise realisation of the second. There are both astronomical observation methods and laboratory measurement methods that are used to realise units of the standard metre. Because the speed of [[light]] is now exactly defined in terms of the metre, more precise measurement of the speed of light does not result in a more accurate figure for its velocity in standard units, but rather a more accurate definition of the metre. The accuracy of the measured speed of light is considered to be within 1&nbsp;m/s, and the realisation of the metre is within about 3 parts in 1,000,000,000, or a proportion of 0.3x10<sup>\u22128</sup>:1.\n\nThe [[kilogram]] was originally defined as the mass of a man-made artefact of platinum-iridium held in a laboratory in France, until the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|new definition was introduced in May 2019]]. Replicas made in 1879 at the time of the artefact's fabrication and distributed to signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] serve as ''de facto'' standards of mass in those countries. Additional replicas have been fabricated since as additional countries have joined the convention.  The replicas were subject to periodic validation by comparison to the original, called the [[International Prototype of the Kilogram|IPK]]. It became apparent that either the IPK or the replicas or both were deteriorating, and are no longer comparable: they had diverged by 50&nbsp;\u03bcg since fabrication, so figuratively, the accuracy of the kilogram was no better than 5 parts in a hundred million or a proportion of 5x10<sup>\u22128</sup>:1. The accepted redefinition of SI base units replaced the IPK with an exact definition of the [[Planck constant]], which defines the kilogram in terms of the second and metre.\n\n===Base and derived unit structure===\n{{main|Base unit (measurement)}}\n{{see also|SI derived unit}}\nThe metric system base units were originally adopted because they represented fundamental orthogonal dimensions of measurement corresponding to how we perceive nature: a spatial dimension, a time dimension, one for inertia, and later, a more subtle one for the dimension of an \"invisible substance\" known as electricity or more generally, electromagnetism. One and only one unit in each of these dimensions was defined, unlike older systems where multiple perceptual quantities with the same dimension were prevalent, like inches, feet and yards or ounces, pounds and tons. Units for other quantities like area and volume, which are also spatial dimensional quantities, were derived from the fundamental ones by logical relationships, so that a unit of square area for example, was the unit of length squared.\n\nMany derived units were already in use before and during the time the metric system evolved, because they represented convenient abstractions of whatever base units were defined for the system, especially in the sciences. So analogous units were scaled in terms of the units of the newly established metric system, and their names adopted into the system. Many of these were associated with electromagnetism.  Other perceptual units, like volume, which were not defined in terms of base units, were incorporated into the system with definitions in the metric base units, so that the system remained simple. It grew in number of units, but the system retained a uniform structure.\n\n=== Decimal ratios ===\nSome customary systems of weights and measures had duodecimal ratios, which meant quantities were conveniently divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6.  But it was difficult to do arithmetic with things like {{frac|1|4}} pound or {{frac|1|3}} foot. There was no system of notation for successive fractions: for example, {{frac|1|3}} of {{frac|1|3}} of a foot was not an inch or any other unit. But the system of counting in decimal ratios did have notation, and the system had the algebraic property of multiplicative closure: a fraction of a fraction, or a multiple of a fraction was a quantity in the system, like {{frac|1|10}} of {{frac|1|10}} which is {{frac|1|100}}. So a decimal radix became the ratio between unit sizes of the metric system.\n\n=== Prefixes for multiples and submultiples ===\n{{Main|Metric prefix}}\nIn the metric system, multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern.<ref group = Note>Non-SI units for time and plane angle measurement, inherited from existing systems, are an exception to the decimal-multiplier rule</ref>\n{{common metric prefixes}}\nA common set of decimal-based prefixes that have the effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use. The concept of using consistent classical ([[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) names for the prefixes was first proposed in a report by the [[French Revolution]]ary Commission on Weights and Measures in May 1793.<ref name=Alder>{{cite book\n|title = The Measure of all Things\u2014The Seven-Year-Odyssey that Transformed the World\n|last= Alder\n|first= Ken\n|year= 2002\n|publisher= Abacus\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-349-11507-8}}</ref>{{rp|89\u201396}} The prefix ''kilo'', for example, is used to multiply the unit by 1000, and the prefix ''milli'' is to indicate a one-thousandth part of the unit. Thus the ''[[kilogram]]'' and ''[[kilometre]]'' are a thousand [[gram]]s and [[metre]]s respectively, and a ''[[milligram]]'' and ''[[millimetre]]'' are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively. These relations can be written symbolically as:<ref name=SI_prefix>{{SIbrochure8th|pages=121,122}}</ref>\n{{block indent|1=1&nbsp;mg = 0.001&nbsp;g}}\n{{block indent|1=1&nbsp;km = 1000&nbsp;m}}\n\nIn the early days, multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given Greek-derived prefixes such as  ''kilo-'' and ''mega-'', and those that were negative powers of ten were given Latin-derived prefixes such as ''centi-'' and ''milli-''.

It is based on the metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second\u2013ampere (MKSA) system of units from early in the 20th century. It also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power (watt) and irradience (lumen). Electrical units were taken from the International system then in use.  Other units like those for energy (joule) were modelled on those from the older CGS system, but scaled to be coherent with MKSA units. Two additional base units, ''degree Kelvin'' equivalent to degree Celsius for thermodynamic temperature, and ''candela'', roughly equivalent to the [[international candle]] unit of illumination, were introduced. Later, another base unit, the ''mole'', a unit of mass equivalent to Avogadro's number of specified molecules, was added along with several other derived units.\n\nThe system was promulgated by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: ''Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures'' \u2013 CGPM) in 1960.  At that time, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line of the [[krypton-86]]<ref group=Note>A stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally</ref> atom, and the standard metre artefact from 1889 was retired.\n\nToday, the International system of units consists of 7 base units and innumerable coherent derived units including 22 with special names. The last new derived unit, the ''katal'' for catalytic activity, was added in 1999. Some of the base units are now realised in terms of invariant constants of physics. As a consequence, the speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant, and defines the metre as {{frac|299,792,458}} of the distance light travels in a second. [[2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units#Kilogram|Until 2019]], the kilogram was defined by a man-made artefact of deteriorating platinum-iridium. The range of decimal prefixes has been extended to those for 10<sup>24</sup>, ''yotta'', and 10<sup>\u221224</sup>, ''yocto'', which are unfamiliar because nothing in our everyday lives is that big or that small.\n\nThe International System of Units has been adopted as the official system of weights and measures by all nations in the world except for Myanmar, Liberia, and the United States, while the United States is the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html|title=The World Factbook, Appendix G: Weights and Measures |year=2010|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=26 Feb 2020 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binary prefix]], used in computer science\n* [[Electrostatic units]]\n* [[History of measurement]]\n* [[History of the metric system]]\n* [[ISO/IEC 80000]], international standard of quantities and their units, superseding [[ISO 31]]\n* [[Metric units]]\n* [[Metrology]]\n* [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiversity|Using the Metric System}}\n* [http://archives.cbc.ca/science_technology/measurement/topics/1572/ CBC Radio Archives] For Good Measure: Canada Converts to Metric\n\n{{systems of measurement}}\n{{systems}}\n{{French Revolution navbox}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Metric system| ]]\n[[Category:International System of Units]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]\n", "name_user": "122.105.189.34", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eRealisation)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system"}

It also includes the '''Arkansas Post Canal''', a short [[canal]] named for nearby [[Arkansas Post National Memorial]], connecting the Arkansas and White Rivers.\n\nThrough Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams artificially deepen and widen this modest sized river to build it into a commercially navigable body of water.  The design enables traffic to overcome an elevation difference of {{convert|420|ft|m}} between the Mississippi River and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa.<ref name = \"CoE-MKARNS\" /> Along the section of the Arkansas River that carries the McClellan-Kerr channel, the river sustains commercial barge traffic and offers passenger and recreational use and is a series of reservoirs.

The announcement also added the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) as an official sponsor.<ref name=\"USDOT\">\"Oklahoma Waterway Takes Prestigious Step Up in National Status (PRESS RELEASE)\".

S. Army Corps of Engineers had increased its designation of the MKARNS from a moderate-use to a high-use waterway system. The high-use designation means that a waterway carries more than 10 million tons per year, having a value of more than 12 million ton-miles per year.<ref name=\"USDOT\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nThe Arkansas River is very shallow through Arkansas and Oklahoma, and was naturally incapable of supporting river traffic through most of the year.  To allow for navigation, construction was started in 1963 on a system of channels and locks to connect the many reservoirs along the length of the Arkansas River.  The first section, running to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], opened on January  1, 1969.  The first barge to reach the Port of Catoosa arrived in early 1971.\n\nEach lock measures {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|600|ft|m}} long, the standard size for much of the Mississippi River waterway.  Standard jumbo [[barge]]s, measuring 35 by {{convert|195|ft|m}}, are grouped 3 wide by 3 long, with a tug at center rear, to form a barge ''tow'' which can be fit into a lock.  Larger barge tows must be broken down and passed through the lock in sections, and rejoined on the opposite side.<ref name= \"ODOT Facts\">[https://www.ok.gov/odot/documents/2016%20WW%20FACT%20SHEET-revised.pdf \"McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System 2016 Inland Waterway Fact Sheet\"].

ODOT says that the capacity of each barge could be increased by 200 tons for each foot of draft.<ref name= \"ODOT Facts\"/> An article in 2010 stated that much of MKARNS is already {{convert|12|feet|m}}deep, so that only about {{convert|75|miles|km}} would need to be deepened.

Except as noted, all locks are on the Arkansas River.\n\nThere is no lock 11; sequentially, it would have been in the middle of [[Lake Dardanelle]]. Per the animated system map (see \"External links\"), Dardanelle Lock & Dam (lock 10), which forms Lake Dardanelle, is the highest facility on the system (54 feet between upper & lower pools); Ozark-Jeta Taylor Lock & Dam (lock 12), just above that lake, is the third highest (34 feet).  Thus, it is likely that those two facilities were redesigned, in terms of height and possibly location, so as to eliminate lock 11 as originally planned.

The system was named for two Senators: [[Robert S. Kerr]] (D-OK) and [[John Little McClellan|John L. McClellan]] (D-AR), who pushed authorizing legislation through Congress. The system officially opened June 5, 1971. President Richard M. Nixon attended the opening ceremony.<ref name=\"EOHC-MKARNS\">O'Dell, Larry.

It also includes the '''Arkansas Post Canal''', a short [[canal]] named for nearby [[Arkansas Post National Memorial]], connecting the Arkansas and White Rivers.\n\nThrough Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams artificially deepen and widen this modest sized river to build it into a commercially navigable body of water.  The design enables traffic to overcome an elevation difference of {{convert|420|ft|m}} between the Mississippi River and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa.<ref name = \"CoE-MKARNS\" /> Along the section of the Arkansas River that carries the McClellan-Kerr channel, the river sustains commercial barge traffic and offers passenger and recreational use and is a series of reservoirs.

The announcement also added the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) as an official sponsor.<ref name=\"USDOT\">\"Oklahoma Waterway Takes Prestigious Step Up in National Status (PRESS RELEASE)\".

S. Army Corps of Engineers had increased its designation of the MKARNS from a moderate-use to a high-use waterway system. The high-use designation means that a waterway carries more than 10 million tons per year, having a value of more than 12 million ton-miles per year.<ref name=\"USDOT\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nThe Arkansas River is very shallow through Arkansas and Oklahoma, and was naturally incapable of supporting river traffic through most of the year.  To allow for navigation, construction was started in 1963 on a system of channels and locks to connect the many reservoirs along the length of the Arkansas River.  The first section, running to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], opened on January  1, 1969.  The first barge to reach the Port of Catoosa arrived in early 1971.\n\nEach lock measures {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|600|ft|m}} long, the standard size for much of the Mississippi River waterway.  Standard jumbo [[barge]]s, measuring 35 by {{convert|195|ft|m}}, are grouped 3 wide by 3 long, with a tug at center rear, to form a barge ''tow'' which can be fit into a lock.  Larger barge tows must be broken down and passed through the lock in sections, and rejoined on the opposite side.<ref name= \"ODOT Facts\">[https://www.ok.gov/odot/documents/2016%20WW%20FACT%20SHEET-revised.pdf \"McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System 2016 Inland Waterway Fact Sheet\"].

ODOT says that the capacity of each barge could be increased by 200 tons for each foot of draft.<ref name= \"ODOT Facts\"/> An article in 2010 stated that much of MKARNS is already {{convert|12|feet|m}}deep, so that only about {{convert|75|miles|km}} would need to be deepened.

Except as noted, all locks are on the Arkansas River.\n\nThere is no lock 11; sequentially, it would have been in the middle of [[Lake Dardanelle]]. Per the animated system map (see \"External links\"), Dardanelle Lock & Dam (lock 10), which forms Lake Dardanelle, is the highest facility on the system (54 feet between upper & lower pools); Ozark-Jeta Taylor Lock & Dam (lock 12), just above that lake, is the third highest (34 feet).  Thus, it is likely that those two facilities were redesigned, in terms of height and possibly location, so as to eliminate lock 11 as originally planned.  The Mississippi River lock is numbered lock 99 as it was added to the system after it was completed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+McClellan\u2013Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System Locks and Dams\n|-\n!Feature!!Navigational distance<br>from Mississippi River!!Location!!Coordinates!!Photo\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Arkansas\n|-\n|[[Montgomery Point Lock and Dam]]<br>(Lock 99)||{{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}||[[White River (Arkansas)|White River]]||{{Coord|33|56|45|N|91|05|13|W|format=dms|display=inline|name=Montgomery Point Lock and Dam|type:landmark_region:US-AR}}||[[File:Dam Coffer.jpg|100px|Montgomery Point Lock & Dam<br>August 25, 2005<br> USACE]]|\n|-\n|[[Norrell Lock and Dam]]<br>(Lock 1)||{{convert|10.3|mi|km|abbr=on}}||Arkansas Post Canal||{{Coord|34|01|10|N|91|11|40|W|format=dms|display=inline|name=Norrell Lock and Dam|type:landmark_region:US-AR}}||[[File:Norrell Lock and Dam, Arkansas.jpg|100px]]\n|-\n|Lock 2||{{convert|13.3|mi|km|abbr=on}}||Arkansas Post Canal||{{Coord|34|01|34|N|91|14|45|W|format=dms|display=inline|name=Lock No. 2|type:landmark_region:US-AR}}||\n|-\n|[[Wilbur D.
