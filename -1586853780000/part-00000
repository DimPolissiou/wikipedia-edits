The patrol was formed to support the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] building aerodrome facilities in [[Greenland]] for ferrying aircraft to the [[British Isles]], and to defend Greenland with special attention to preventing German operations in the northeast.<ref name=t56>Tilley, pp.5&6</ref> Coast Guard cutters were assisted by aircraft and dog sled teams patrolling the Greenland coast for [[Axis powers|Axis]] military activities. The patrol escorted Allied shipping to and from Greenland, built navigation and communication facilities, and provided rescue and [[weather ship]] services in the area from 1941 through 1945.\n\n==Background==\nEarth's atmospheric circulation pattern requires westerly meteorological observations for prediction of weather conditions to the east. Weather observation stations in Greenland improved the accuracy of [[weather forecasting]] for the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[northern Europe]] for tactical advantage in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and [[European theatre of World War II]].<ref name=dsk>Ruge (1957) pp.285-287</ref> [[Greenland]] had been part of the [[Danish colonial empire]] since 1814. Greenland appeared relatively unprotected following [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German occupation]] of [[Denmark]] on 9 April 1940. The [[Allies of World War II]] became concerned about the possibility of Axis military bases on Greenland.<ref name=w56>Willoughby (1957) pp.95&96</ref> The [[cryolite]] mine at [[Ivittuut]] was a strategically important source of flux for [[electrolysis]] of [[aluminum]] ores by the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process]] for aircraft production.<ref name=t23>Tilley, p.2&3</ref>\n\nUnited States Coast Guard personnel had acquired extensive experience in the waters around Greenland as part of their [[International Ice Patrol]] duties since 1915. Following negotiations with the Danish Minister to Washington, the [[United States]] opened a consulate at [[Nuuk]]; and the {{USCGC|Comanche|WPG-76|6}} transported the first American Consul to Ivittuut in May 1940. The United States then agreed to sell armaments to Greenland; and fourteen Coast Guardsmen were discharged to act as civilian armed guards protecting the cryolite mine with a {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} gun offloaded from the {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|6}}.<ref name=t23/> {{USCGC|Duane|WPG-33|6}} conducted an air survey of Greenland's west coast in August 1940, while {{USCGC|Northland|WPG-49|6}} cruised along Greenland's east coast searching for evidence of European military activity and compiling information for publication of a ''[[Nautical chart|Greenland Pilot]]''. ''Northland'' discovered three weather reporting stations being operated by Norwegians reporting conditions to Germany.  The United States State Department reported the situation to British authorities who dispatched a Norwegian gunboat to arrest the Norwegians and close the weather stations.<ref name=Hussey>Hussey</ref>  On 17 March 1941 USCGC ''[[Banff-class sloop|Cayuga]]'' sailed from [[Boston]] with the South Greenland Survey Expedition to locate and recommend sites for airfields, seaplane bases, radio stations, meteorological stations, and aids to navigation. ''Northland'' relieved ''Cuyuga'' on 17 May 1941 to continue the survey expedition after ''Cuyuga'' was turned over to the [[Royal Navy]] as HMS ''Totland''.<ref name=w56/>\n\nThe United States occupied Greenland on 9 April 1941 under the expansive doctrine adopted at the [[Havana Conference (1940)]]. As the survey results became available, construction began on a radio and aerological station on [[Akia Island]] and airfields at [[Narsarsuaq]] and at Kipisako near Ivittuut.<ref name=w56/> [[Narsarsuaq Air Base]] was code-named Bluie West 1 (or BW1), and became the major Allied airfield in Greenland. Thousands of planes stopped there to refuel en route to England.<ref name=t56/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, Germany implemented Operation Notch transporting a weather party to eastern Greenland aboard the weather ship ''[[German weather ship WBS 1 Hermann|Hermann]]''. The ship remained icebound while the weather party radioed weather observations hoping they would not be found in the darkness of polar winter. Similar weather station Operations Viola and Edelweiss were supported by the weather ships ''[[German weather ship WBS 2 Coburg|Coburg]]'' in the autumn of 1943, and ''[[German weather ship WBS 6 Kehdingen|Kehdingen]]'' in the autumn of 1944.<ref name=dsk/>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Greenland in World War II}}\nA South Greenland Patrol was established on 1 June 1941 with Geodetic Survey ship ''[[Bowdoin (Arctic schooner)|Bowdoin]]'', tug {{USS|Raritan|WYT-93|6}}, and cutters USCGC ''Comanche'' and {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|6}}. {{USS|Bear|1874|6}} with {{USCGC|North Star|WPG-59|6}} and USCGC ''Northland'' established a Northeast Greenland Patrol a month later. The two patrols were consolidated in October 1941 as Task Force 24.8, the Greenland Patrol of the Atlantic Fleet.<ref name=w56/>\n\nOn 12 September 1941 ''Northland'' intercepted the Norwegian sealer ''[[SS Busk\u00f8|Busk\u00f8]]'', which was supporting a German radio station transmitting weather information to Germany. ''Northland'' put a prize crew aboard ''Busk\u00f8'', captured the radio station with some code information, and interned the personnel at Boston.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.99&100</ref>\n\nThe Greenland Patrol was responsible for escorting ships bringing men and supplies to Greenland, and sometimes for breaking a path through the ice to assist their arrival. On 25 August 1942 {{USCGC|Mojave|WPG-47|6}} was escorting the United States Army Transport ''Chatham'' as the fast section of [[Convoys SG-6/LN-6|convoy SG 6]] while {{USCGC|Mohawk|WPG-78|6}} and ''Algonquin'' were escorting the slow section of {{USS|Laramie|AO-16|6}} and {{USS|Harjurand|ARS-31|2}} with steamships ''Biscaya'', ''Arlyn'' and ''Alcoa Guard''. ''Chatham'' and ''Arlyn'' were sunk by {{GS|U-517||2}} and ''Laramie'' was damaged by {{GS|U-165|1941|2}}.<ref>Willoughby (1957) p.101</ref>\n\nDanes, Norwegians, and [[Inuit]] were recruited into a [[Sl\u00e6depatruljen Sirius|sledge patrol]] to search for additional Axis weather reporting stations along the coast. Sledge expeditions also rescued Allied airmen making forced landings on the Greenland ice cap. Coast Guard work parties built range lights, shore markers and [[LORAN]] radio beacons to aid navigation. ''Northland'' landed 41 men with thirty tons of equipment to establish a [[high-frequency direction finding]] station on [[Jan Mayen]] in November 1942.<ref name=w03>Willoughby (1957) pp.100-104</ref> The sledge patrol attacked the Operation Notch weather station supported by ''Hermann'' and captured some weather station personnel before the remainder were rescued by German aircraft. ''Hermann'' was sunk by allied aircraft.<ref name=dsk/>\n\nThe Greenland Patrol was augmented in the summer of 1942 by ten fishing trawlers purchased in Boston, repainted in blue and white Thayer system camouflage, and given Inuit names. ''Natsek'' disappeared on 17 December 1942 while transiting the [[Strait of Belle Isle]] with ''Nanok'' and {{USS|Bluebird|AM-72|2}} in gale force winds with blinding snow. The {{convert|116|ft|m|adj=on}} trawler was never seen again, and may have been capsized by ice accumulation from freezing spray in heavy seas.<ref name=w03/> Surviving trawlers were returned to their civilian owners in 1944 as [[Tacoma-class frigate]]s became available for weather ship duties.<ref>Silverstone (1968) pp.246-252&384-385</ref>\n\n{{SS|Dorchester||6}} of convoy SG 19 was torpedoed by {{GS|U-223||2}} on 2 February 1943 while being escorted by {{USCGC|Tampa|1921|6}}, {{USCGC|Escanaba|WPG-77|2}} and ''Comanche''. Despite rescue efforts by the cutters, 675 men died of [[hypothermia]] or drowning in the worst United States troopship sinking of the war.<ref>Morison (1975) pp.331-334</ref> ''Escanaba'' was later destroyed by a mysterious explosion on 13 June 1943.<ref>Tilley, pp.13&14</ref>\n\nFrom October 1943 Coast Guard Patrol Bombing Squadron Six operated twelve [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]]s from Narsarsuaq Air Base, [[Naval Station Argentia]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]] providing reconnaissance, antisubmarine patrol, mail delivery, rescue service, and observation surveys of ice conditions for ships of the Greenland Patrol. Aircraft greatly improved patrol efficiency when weather conditions were suitable for flying. Ships of the Greenland Patrol acted as plane guards on weather patrol stations in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and south of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]] maintaining radio contact with trans-Atlantic aircraft flights and provided rescue service for aircraft ditching at sea.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.106&108</ref>\n\nBetween July and October 1944, ''Northland'', {{USCGC|Storis|WMEC-38|2}}, {{USCGC|Eastwind|WAGB-279|2}} and {{USCGC|Southwind|WAGB-280|2}} operated against Axis weather stations on the northeast coast of Greenland. ''Coburg'' was destroyed in July after being damaged by ice and her weather party evacuated by a U-boat. ''Northland'' intercepted ''Kehdingen'' and captured her German weather party, while escaping an attack by the escorting ''[[German submarine U-703|U-703]]'' when the U-boat's torpedoes detonated on floating ice. Failure of the first attempt at Operation Edelweiss produced a followup effort by the weather ship ''[[USS Callao (IX-205)|Externsteine]]'' which was similarly intercepted.<ref name=dsk/> Capture of sixty German weather personnel effectively ended Axis weather observation from Greenland in October 1944.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.108-110</ref>\n\n==Ships of the Greenland Patrol==\nSome ships of the Greenland Patrol were conventional cutters briefly assigned to the patrol. Others were unique and sometimes historic vessels specifically designed for polar exploration and well suited to conditions encountered by the patrol. Larger cutters escorted SG convoys of freighters and troopships between [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|'''S'''ydney]] and the larger '''G'''reenland ports serving Narsarsuaq Air Base and the Ivittuut cryolite mine, while trawlers and tugs (sometimes towing [[barge]]s) distributed supplies from those ports to smaller Army [[Bluie]] bases on remote [[fjord]]s without port facilities.<ref>Novak</ref>\n\nThree cutters in the Patrol (''Bear'', ''Bowdoin'' and ''Northland'') were equipped with sails.  This was, most probably, the last time sail powered ships were used for wartime missions.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Class\n!Displacement\n!Speed\n!Guns\n!Launched\n!Notes\n|-\n|{{USS|Bear|1874|2}}\n|unique\n|648 tons<ref>Silverstone (1968) pp.353&359</ref>\n|\n|\n|1874\n|Bering Sea [[weather ship]] built as a seal catcher;

Similar weather station Operations Viola and Edelweiss were supported by the weather ships ''[[German weather ship WBS 2 Coburg|Coburg]]'' in the autumn of 1943, and ''[[German weather ship WBS 6 Kehdingen|Kehdingen]]'' in the autumn of 1944.<ref name=dsk/>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Greenland in World War II}}\nA South Greenland Patrol was established on 1 June 1941 with Geodetic Survey ship ''[[Bowdoin (Arctic schooner)|Bowdoin]]'', tug {{USS|Raritan|WYT-93|6}}, and cutters USCGC ''Comanche'' and {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|6}}. {{USS|Bear|1874|6}} with {{USCGC|North Star|WPG-59|6}} and USCGC ''Northland'' established a Northeast Greenland Patrol a month later. The two patrols were consolidated in October 1941 as Task Force 24.8, the Greenland Patrol of the Atlantic Fleet.<ref name=w56/>\n\nOn 12 September 1941 ''Northland'' intercepted the Norwegian sealer ''[[SS Busk\u00f8|Busk\u00f8]]'', which was supporting a German radio station transmitting weather information to Germany. ''Northland'' put a prize crew aboard ''Busk\u00f8'', captured the radio station with some code information, and interned the personnel at Boston.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.99&100</ref>\n\nThe Greenland Patrol was responsible for escorting ships bringing men and supplies to Greenland, and sometimes for breaking a path through the ice to assist their arrival. On 25 August 1942 {{USCGC|Mojave|WPG-47|6}} was escorting the United States Army Transport ''Chatham'' as the fast section of [[Convoys SG-6/LN-6|convoy SG 6]] while {{USCGC|Mohawk|WPG-78|6}} and ''Algonquin'' were escorting the slow section of {{USS|Laramie|AO-16|6}} and {{USS|Harjurand|ARS-31|2}} with steamships ''Biscaya'', ''Arlyn'' and ''Alcoa Guard''. ''Chatham'' and ''Arlyn'' were sunk by {{GS|U-517||2}} and ''Laramie'' was damaged by {{GS|U-165|1941|2}}.<ref>Willoughby (1957) p.101</ref>\n\nDanes, Norwegians, and [[Inuit]] were recruited into a [[Sl\u00e6depatruljen Sirius|sledge patrol]] to search for additional Axis weather reporting stations along the coast. Sledge expeditions also rescued Allied airmen making forced landings on the Greenland ice cap. Coast Guard work parties built range lights, shore markers and [[LORAN]] radio beacons to aid navigation. ''Northland'' landed 41 men with thirty tons of equipment to establish a [[high-frequency direction finding]] station on [[Jan Mayen]] in November 1942.<ref name=w03>Willoughby (1957) pp.100-104</ref> The sledge patrol attacked the Operation Notch weather station supported by ''Hermann'' and captured some weather station personnel before the remainder were rescued by German aircraft. ''Hermann'' was sunk by allied aircraft.<ref name=dsk/>\n\nThe Greenland Patrol was augmented in the summer of 1942 by ten fishing trawlers purchased in Boston, repainted in blue and white Thayer system camouflage, and given Inuit names. ''Natsek'' disappeared on 17 December 1942 while transiting the [[Strait of Belle Isle]] with ''Nanok'' and {{USS|Bluebird|AM-72|2}} in gale force winds with blinding snow. The {{convert|116|ft|m|adj=on}} trawler was never seen again, and may have been capsized by ice accumulation from freezing spray in heavy seas.<ref name=w03/> Surviving trawlers were returned to their civilian owners in 1944 as [[Tacoma-class frigate]]s became available for weather ship duties.<ref>Silverstone (1968) pp.246-252&384-385</ref>\n\n{{SS|Dorchester||6}} of convoy SG 19 was torpedoed by {{GS|U-223||2}} on 2 February 1943 while being escorted by {{USCGC|Tampa|1921|6}}, {{USCGC|Escanaba|WPG-77|2}} and ''Comanche''. Despite rescue efforts by the cutters, 675 men died of [[hypothermia]] or drowning in the worst United States troopship sinking of the war.<ref>Morison (1975) pp.331-334</ref> ''Escanaba'' was later destroyed by a mysterious explosion on 13 June 1943.<ref>Tilley, pp.13&14</ref>\n\nFrom October 1943 Coast Guard Patrol Bombing Squadron Six operated twelve [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]]s from Narsarsuaq Air Base, [[Naval Station Argentia]], and [[Reykjav\u00edk Airport]] providing reconnaissance, antisubmarine patrol, mail delivery, rescue service, and observation surveys of ice conditions for ships of the Greenland Patrol. Aircraft greatly improved patrol efficiency when weather conditions were suitable for flying. Ships of the Greenland Patrol acted as plane guards on weather patrol stations in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and south of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]] maintaining radio contact with trans-Atlantic aircraft flights and provided rescue service for aircraft ditching at sea.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.106&108</ref>\n\nBetween July and October 1944, ''Northland'', {{USCGC|Storis|WMEC-38|2}}, {{USCGC|Eastwind|WAGB-279|2}} and {{USCGC|Southwind|WAGB-280|2}} operated against Axis weather stations on the northeast coast of Greenland. ''Coburg'' was destroyed in July after being damaged by ice and her weather party evacuated by a U-boat. ''Northland'' intercepted ''Kehdingen'' and captured her German weather party, while escaping an attack by the escorting ''[[German submarine U-703|U-703]]'' when the U-boat's torpedoes detonated on floating ice. Failure of the first attempt at Operation Edelweiss produced a followup effort by the weather ship ''[[USS Callao (IX-205)|Externsteine]]'' which was similarly intercepted.<ref name=dsk/> Capture of sixty German weather personnel effectively ended Axis weather observation from Greenland in October 1944.<ref>Willoughby (1957) pp.108-110</ref>\n\n==Ships of the Greenland Patrol==\nSome ships of the Greenland Patrol were conventional cutters briefly assigned to the patrol. Others were unique and sometimes historic vessels specifically designed for polar exploration and well suited to conditions encountered by the patrol. Larger cutters escorted SG convoys of freighters and troopships between [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|'''S'''ydney]] and the larger '''G'''reenland ports serving Narsarsuaq Air Base and the Ivittuut cryolite mine, while trawlers and tugs (sometimes towing [[barge]]s) distributed supplies from those ports to smaller Army [[Bluie]] bases on remote [[fjord]]s without port facilities.<ref>Novak</ref>\n\nThree cutters in the Patrol (''Bear'', ''Bowdoin'' and ''Northland'') were equipped with sails.  This was, most probably, the last time sail powered ships were used for wartime missions.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Class\n!Displacement\n!Speed\n!Guns\n!Launched\n!Notes\n|-\n|{{USS|Bear|1874|2}}\n|unique\n|648 tons<ref>Silverstone (1968) pp.353&359</ref>\n|\n|\n|1874\n|Bering Sea [[weather ship]] built as a seal catcher;

Having graduated through their youth system, he made 252 appearances for the [[Glasgow]] based club from 1993 to 2005, punctuated with a season in England with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[1998\u201399 Football League|1998\u201399]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. In his time at Rangers he became team captain and won numerous domestic league and cup honours, including making 44 appearances and scoring four goals in their [[2002\u201303 Rangers F.C. season|2002\u201303 Treble-winning season]].\n\nAfter leaving Rangers on a free transfer in January 2005, Moore spent a half-season at German [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], before moving to English [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Released by Newcastle after an injury hit two seasons, Moore returned to Australia signing with [[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]] (later renamed Brisbane Roar) in the Australian [[A-League]], as their captain and [[A-League#Marquee player|Marquee player]]. After three seasons with the Roar, in January 2010 Moore moved to [[Super League Greece|Greek Super League]] side [[AO Kavala]], only to leave in March.\n\nIn international football, Moore has made over 50 appearances for the [[Australia national association football team|Australia national team]], including at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cups in Germany and South Africa. Having made his debut in 1995, he has been [[List of Australian national association football team captains|Australian team captain]] a number of times.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Rangers===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2017}}\nMoore was born in [[Canterbury, New South Wales]] and raised in [[Doonside, New South Wales]]. He played junior football with [[Brisbane]] club [[North Star FC|North Star]] after his family relocated north when he was thirteen, before a scholarship with the [[Australian Institute of Sport Football Program|Australian Institute of Sport]]. Moore joined [[Rangers F.C. Under-20s and Academy|Rangers]] youth system and became an important player at the centre of Rangers defence up until 2004 over two spells.\n\nMoore spent most of the 1998\u201399 season at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]; despite being regarded as a success in London as the club fought relegation, he returned to Rangers after the South London club defaulted on transfer payments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nMoore was the captain of the \"Olyroos\", the Australian Olympic Football Team at the [[2004 Olympics]] at [[Athens, Greece]], when they managed to reach the quarter-finals. However, his involvement angered Rangers manager [[Alex McLeish]] as it forced him to miss the start of the Scottish league season. As a result, Moore was stripped of the club captaincy and was forced to the fringes of the team.\n\nMoore won twelve major honours with Rangers including five league championships and a domestic treble in 2003.\n\n===Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach===\nMoore was given a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] and joined [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] on 3 January 2005, where he teamed up with former Rangers manager [[Dick Advocaat]].

Moore's actual first game came at home to [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]] in which he scored one of five goals. Injuries ruined Moore's [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] career, and he only made eight premiership appearances in the [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nMoore was then injured in November 2006 and was ruled out for several months. He returned but struggled to get back into the team, with [[Peter Ramage]], [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]], and [[Titus Bramble]] keeping him out. After [[Titus Bramble]]'s dip in form, Moore returned to the first team. Moore made 17 premiership appearances in the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307 season]].\n\nOn 16 May 2007, it was announced that Moore's contract would not be renewed, and he was released by the club.

His [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] profile describes him as being \"tough-tackling and uncompromising but also calm and composed under pressure.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Player Profile|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/players/player=154061/profile.html|publisher=fifa.com|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nMoore, born and raised in the western Sydney suburb of Doonside, where he attended Crawford Public School and Doonside High while playing for the Doonside Hawks Soccer Club, is best known for his two spells with [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] / [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Having graduated through their youth system, he made 252 appearances for the [[Glasgow]] based club from 1993 to 2005, punctuated with a season in England with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[1998\u201399 Football League|1998\u201399]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. In his time at Rangers he became team captain and won numerous domestic league and cup honours, including making 44 appearances and scoring four goals in their [[2002\u201303 Rangers F.C. season|2002\u201303 Treble-winning season]].\n\nAfter leaving Rangers on a free transfer in January 2005, Moore spent a half-season at German [[Bundesliga]] club [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]], before moving to English [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Released by Newcastle after an injury hit two seasons, Moore returned to Australia signing with [[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]] (later renamed Brisbane Roar) in the Australian [[A-League]], as their captain and [[A-League#Marquee player|Marquee player]]. After three seasons with the Roar, in January 2010 Moore moved to [[Super League Greece|Greek Super League]] side [[AO Kavala]], only to leave in March.\n\nIn international football, Moore has made over 50 appearances for the [[Australia national association football team|Australia national team]], including at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] World Cups in Germany and South Africa. Having made his debut in 1995, he has been [[List of Australian national association football team captains|Australian team captain]] a number of times.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Rangers===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2017}}\nMoore was born in [[Canterbury, New South Wales]] and raised in [[Doonside, New South Wales]]. He played junior football with [[Brisbane]] club [[North Star FC|North Star]] after his family relocated north when he was thirteen, before a scholarship with the [[Australian Institute of Sport Football Program|Australian Institute of Sport]]. Moore joined [[Rangers F.C. Under-20s and Academy|Rangers]] youth system and became an important player at the centre of Rangers defence up until 2004 over two spells.\n\nMoore spent most of the 1998\u201399 season at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]; despite being regarded as a success in London as the club fought relegation, he returned to Rangers after the South London club defaulted on transfer payments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nMoore was the captain of the \"Olyroos\", the Australian Olympic Football Team at the [[2004 Olympics]] at [[Athens, Greece]], when they managed to reach the quarter-finals. However, his involvement angered Rangers manager [[Alex McLeish]] as it forced him to miss the start of the Scottish league season. As a result, Moore was stripped of the club captaincy and was forced to the fringes of the team.\n\nMoore won twelve major honours with Rangers including five league championships and a domestic treble in 2003.\n\n===Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach===\nMoore was given a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] and joined [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]] on 3 January 2005, where he teamed up with former Rangers manager [[Dick Advocaat]]. When Advocaat was sacked after a short time in charge, Moore left the German club after falling out with the club management.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4129465.stm | title = Moore completes Borussia switch | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 3 January 2005 | accessdate = 31 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 30 July 2005, he signed a two-year deal at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to play for the first time in the [[Premier League]].\n\nMoore made his competitive Newcastle United debut on 22 March 2006 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[FA Cup]] quarter-final, becoming the second Australian to play for the Magpies after [[Dave Mitchell (footballer)|Dave Mitchell]] who had a loan spell at St James' Park in the 1990\u201391 season. Moore's actual first game came at home to [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]] in which he scored one of five goals. Injuries ruined Moore's [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] career, and he only made eight premiership appearances in the [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306 season]].\n\nMoore was then injured in November 2006 and was ruled out for several months. He returned but struggled to get back into the team, with [[Peter Ramage]], [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]], and [[Titus Bramble]] keeping him out. After [[Titus Bramble]]'s dip in form, Moore returned to the first team. Moore made 17 premiership appearances in the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307 season]].\n\nOn 16 May 2007, it was announced that Moore's contract would not be renewed, and he was released by the club. He made 31 appearances for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]].\n\n===Brisbane Roar===\nIt was rumoured on 25 July 2007 that Moore had signed with Queensland Roar (now [[Brisbane Roar]]), to become the Roar's [[A-League#Marquee player|Marquee]] signing for the [[2007\u201308 A-League|2007\u201308 Hyundai A-League Season]] and the 2008\u20132009 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&cid=92286 |title=Moore tipped to join Roar |work=SBS The World Game website |accessdate=25 July 2007 |date=24 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011085109/http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&cid=92286 |archivedate=11 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/57086,moore-signs-up-with-roar.aspx | title = Moore signs up with Roar | work = Four-Four-Two Magazine Website | accessdate = 25 July 2007 | date = 25 July 2007 | author = Jon Ritson | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120930141024/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/57086,moore-signs-up-with-roar.aspx | archivedate = 30 September 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> This was confirmed with an announcement by Queensland and Moore on 25 July 2007 with Moore signing to be Queensland's marquee player for two years.\n\nMoore's career with the Roar did not start well.

There are approximately 13,000,000 speakers. Unlike Standard Korean, most of the variants of the Gyeongsang dialects are [[tone language|tonal]], which is similar to [[Middle Korean]].\n\nGyeongsang dialects vary. A native speaker can distinguish the dialect of [[Daegu]] from that of the [[Busan]]-[[Ulsan]] area although the first city is less than 100 kilometers away from the latter two cities. Dialectal forms are relatively similar along the midstream of [[Nakdong River]] but are different near Busan and Ulsan, [[Jinju]] and [[Pohang]] as well as along the eastern slopes of [[Mount Jiri]].\n\n==Vowels==\nMost Gyeongsang dialects have six vowels, ''a'' (\u314f), ''e'' (\u3154), ''i'' (\u3163), ''eo'' (\u3153), ''o'' (\u3157), ''u'' (\u315c). In most areas, the vowels \u3150(ae) and \u3154 (e) are conflated, as are \u3161(eu) and \u3153(eo). ''W'' and ''y'' are generally dropped after a consonant, especially in South Gyeongsang dialects. For example, ''soegogi'' (\uc1e0\uace0\uae30) 'beef' is pronounced ''sogogi'' (\uc18c\uace0\uae30), and ''gwaja'' (\uacfc\uc790) 'confectionery' is pronounced ''ggaja'' (\uae4c\uc790).\n\nVowels are [[I-mutation|fronted]] when the following syllable has a ''y'' or ''i'', unless a [[coronal consonant]] intervenes. For example, ''eomi'' 'mother' is ''emi'', and ''gogi'' 'meat' is ''gegi''.<ref name=Sohn>Ho-min Sohn, 2006. ''Korean language in culture and society''</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/13656/1/tLoJaK_06_Korean_dialects_-_final.pdf|title=Korean dialects: a general survey|last=Yeon|first=Jaehoon|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Consonants==\nSouthern Gyeongsang (specifically, nearby [[namhae (sea)|Namhae]]) dialects lack the tense consonant ''ss'' (\u3146). Thus, the speakers pronounce ''ssal'' (\uc300), meaning \"rice\", as ''sal'' (\uc0b4) meaning \"flesh\". Palatalization is widespread: ''gy, gi, ki'' and ''ky'' are pronounced ''j'' and ''ch'', e.g. \uade4 is ''jul'' and \uae30\ub984 is ''jileum'',  while ''hy'' is pronounced ''s,'' e.g. \ud798 is ''sim''. Many words have tense consonants where the standard is tenuis. [[Middle Korean]] ''z'' and ''\u03b2'' are preserved as ''s'' and ''b,'' as in \uc0c8\ube44 ''saebi'' for Standard Korean \uc0c8\uc6b0 ''saeu'' \"shrimp\" or \uac00\uc0c8 ''gasae'' for Standard Korean \uac00\uc704 ''gawi'' \"scissors\".<ref name=Sohn/><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Tone==\nDialects are classified as North Gyeongsang or South Gyeongsang based on [[pitch accent]].

There are approximately 13,000,000 speakers. Unlike Standard Korean, most of the variants of the Gyeongsang dialects are [[tone language|tonal]], which is similar to [[Middle Korean]].\n\nGyeongsang dialects vary. A native speaker can distinguish the dialect of [[Daegu]] from that of the [[Busan]]-[[Ulsan]] area although the first city is less than 100 kilometers away from the latter two cities. Dialectal forms are relatively similar along the midstream of [[Nakdong River]] but are different near Busan and Ulsan, [[Jinju]] and [[Pohang]] as well as along the eastern slopes of [[Mount Jiri]].\n\n==Vowels==\nMost Gyeongsang dialects have six vowels, ''a'' (\u314f), ''e'' (\u3154), ''i'' (\u3163), ''eo'' (\u3153), ''o'' (\u3157), ''u'' (\u315c). In most areas, the vowels \u3150(ae) and \u3154 (e) are conflated, as are \u3161(eu) and \u3153(eo). ''W'' and ''y'' are generally dropped after a consonant, especially in South Gyeongsang dialects. For example, ''soegogi'' (\uc1e0\uace0\uae30) 'beef' is pronounced ''sogogi'' (\uc18c\uace0\uae30), and ''gwaja'' (\uacfc\uc790) 'confectionery' is pronounced ''ggaja'' (\uae4c\uc790).\n\nVowels are [[I-mutation|fronted]] when the following syllable has a ''y'' or ''i'', unless a [[coronal consonant]] intervenes. For example, ''eomi'' 'mother' is ''emi'', and ''gogi'' 'meat' is ''gegi''.<ref name=Sohn>Ho-min Sohn, 2006. ''Korean language in culture and society''</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/13656/1/tLoJaK_06_Korean_dialects_-_final.pdf|title=Korean dialects: a general survey|last=Yeon|first=Jaehoon|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Consonants==\nSouthern Gyeongsang (specifically, nearby [[namhae (sea)|Namhae]]) dialects lack the tense consonant ''ss'' (\u3146). Thus, the speakers pronounce ''ssal'' (\uc300), meaning \"rice\", as ''sal'' (\uc0b4) meaning \"flesh\". Palatalization is widespread: ''gy, gi, ki'' and ''ky'' are pronounced ''j'' and ''ch'', e.g. \uade4 is ''jul'' and \uae30\ub984 is ''jileum'',  while ''hy'' is pronounced ''s,'' e.g. \ud798 is ''sim''. Many words have tense consonants where the standard is tenuis. [[Middle Korean]] ''z'' and ''\u03b2'' are preserved as ''s'' and ''b,'' as in \uc0c8\ube44 ''saebi'' for Standard Korean \uc0c8\uc6b0 ''saeu'' \"shrimp\".<ref name=Sohn/><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Tone==\nDialects are classified as North Gyeongsang or South Gyeongsang based on [[pitch accent]].

In the film, a [[great white shark|great white]] [[Man-eater|man-eating]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D.

The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).

In the film, a [[great white shark|great white]] [[Man-eater|man-eating]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e96\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scanlon|2009|p=197}}</ref> The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.<ref name=jawschap1>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans-title=\"From Novel to Script\"}}</ref> They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $990,000 in 2018).<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Brown claimed that if had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.<ref name=\"McBride 231\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref>\n\nTo direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker [[John Sturges]]\u2014whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included another maritime adventure, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''\u2014before offering the job to [[Dick Richards]], whose directorial debut, ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'' had come out the previous year.<ref name=\"McBride232\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> However, they grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/> Meanwhile, [[Steven Spielberg]] very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.<ref name=\"Brode 50\"/> He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting [[everyman|everymen]]\".<ref name=jawschap1/> He also revealed in \"The Making of ''Jaws''\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced ''Duel'' by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark.

The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).

It is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[New Zealand]], ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]]. It has several other [[Maori language|Maori]] and [[English language|English]] names. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which having colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M. (2006): A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand\u2019s Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''40'''(3): 844-855.</ref>\n\nThere are five subspecies of the tomtit, each subspecies being restricted to each of the following islands or island groups, North Island, South Island, the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands and the Auckland Islands.

It is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[New Zealand]], ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]]. It has several other [[English language|English]] names as well. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which having colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M.

Known as Chitrakuta Durga, it is said to have been raised by Chitrangada of the [[Mori dynasty]] and then passed into the hands of the [[Pratiharas]] in the 9th century. Subsequent owners of this seat of power included the [[Paramaras]] (10th\u201311th century) and the [[Solankis]] (12 century) before it fell into the hands of the Guhilots or Sisodias of Mewar.{{sfn|ASI}}\n\nThe fort stands atop a 152m hill and covers an area of {{convert|700|acres|sqkm}}. It has a number of gateways and ponds including the Gaumukha kund and Hathi Kund, which is supplied by perennial underground source of water. Heavily fortified, Chittorgarh was believed to be insurmountable until it was sacked by [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1303. It was sacked again a couple of centuries later by [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Bahadur Shah]] of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]].{{sfn|ASI}}\n\n==Background==\nThe Mughals had always been wary of the kingdoms of Rajasthan. Besides being a centre of power, the Rajput dominions also hindered access to both [[Gujarat]] and its prosperous seaports as well as [[Malwa]]. To control either of these regions, the Mughal emperor also needed to arrive at an understanding with the Rajputs. Local rulers such as [[Raja Bharmal]] of [[Amer, Rajasthan|Amber]] had already submitted to Akbar in 1562. Mewar, the most powerful and prominent of the Rajput states, however, had not. While [[Udai Singh II|Udai Singh]], the Rana of Mewar was open to accepting Mughal suzerainty and paying a tribute, he was not prepared to lower his head in obedience to Akbar as, according to [[Abu'l-Fazl]], \"none of his ancestors had bowed down and kissed the ground\". Furthermore, the Rana had also vexed Akbar when he first granted asylum to [[Baz Bahadur]] of Malwa and later, to the Mirzas of [[Sambhal]].{{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=106,107}}\n\nAfter handling the rebellions of the Mirzas and the Uzbek nobles in 1567, Akbar turned his eyes towards Rajasthan and its prestigious kingdom of Mewar.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=106}}\n\nPrior to the siege, the Mughals under Asaf Khan and Wazir Khan attacked and conquered [[Mandalgarh]], where Rawat Balvi solanki was defeated.<ref>[https://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118 Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl]\"\u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n and Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n.. went... with orders to attack the fortress of M\u0101ndal...It was...defended by...Rawat Balv\u012b Solang\u012b....but the conquered it.\"</ref>\n\nOn 20 October 1567, he encamped near the fortress of Chittorgarh. Maharana Udai Singh II had already retreated from the fortress of Chittorgarh and went to Gogunda, leaving behind 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 musketeers under the command of Jaimal and Patta. After arriving at Chittorgarh,\nAkbar sent Asaf Khan to Rampur and Hussain Quli Khan to Udaipur and Kumbalgarh to plunder the Rana's territories. Though both of these areas were raided, Udai Singh II was not found.<ref>[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118 Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl]\"\u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n with a number of officers was sent off to R\u0101mp\u016br...\u1e24usain Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n was sent with a large force to lay hold of him....\u1e24usa\u012bn Qul\u012b Kh\u0101n arrived at Udaip\u016br...the hill-country of Kombalm\u012br....made great search for the R\u0101n\u0101...could get no trace.\"</ref>\n\n==The siege==\n{{Quote box | align = right | salign = right | border = none | halign = center | qstyle = font-style: italic;\n|quote=<poem>\nTwo armies raised their lances\nThey formed ambuscades, and drew up in line\nThey were all iron-fisted, biters of steel,\nAll were famous and were clad in iron\nThe heroes brandished swords red with blood\n</poem>\n| author = [[Abu'l-Fazl]] | source = ''[[Akbarnama]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abu'l-Fazl| authorlink1=Abu'l-Fazl|title=PHI Persian Literature in Translation| url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118|website=persian.packhum.org|language=en}}</ref> | quoted=1}}\nInitially, the Mughals tried to attack the fortress directly but the citadel was so sturdy that the only options available to the Mughals were to either starve out the occupants of the fort or to somehow reach the walls and [[Sapping|sap]] beneath them.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=107}} After initial aggressive attempts at reaching the wall failed, Akbar ordered a complement of 5,000 expert builders, stonemasons, and carpenters to construct ''sabats'' (approach trenches) and mines to reach the walls.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=107}} Two [[Mining (military)|mines]] and one sabat were constructed after significant casualties while three batteries bombarded the fort.

Subsequent owners of this seat of power included the [[Paramaras]] (10th\u201311th century) and the [[Solankis]] (12 century) before it fell into the hands of the Guhilots or Sisodias of Mewar.{{sfn|ASI}}\n\nThe fort stands atop a 152m hill and covers an area of {{convert|700|acres|sqkm}}. It has a number of gateways and ponds including the Gaumukha kund and Hathi Kund, which is supplied by perennial underground source of water. Heavily fortified, Chittorgarh was believed to be insurmountable until it was sacked by [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1303. It was sacked again a couple of centuries later by [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Bahadur Shah]] of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]].{{sfn|ASI}}\n\n==Background==\nThe Mughals had always been wary of the kingdoms of Rajasthan. Besides being a centre of power, the Rajput dominions also hindered access to both [[Gujarat]] and its prosperous seaports as well as [[Malwa]]. To control either of these regions, the Mughal emperor also needed to arrive at an understanding with the Rajputs. Local rulers such as [[Raja Bharmal]] of [[Amer, Rajasthan|Amber]] had already submitted to Akbar in 1562. Mewar, the most powerful and prominent of the Rajput states, however, had not. While [[Udai Singh II|Udai Singh]], the Rana of Mewar was open to accepting Mughal suzerainty and paying a tribute, he was not prepared to lower his head in obedience to Akbar as, according to [[Abu'l-Fazl]], \"none of his ancestors had bowed down and kissed the ground\". Furthermore, the Rana had also vexed Akbar when he first granted asylum to [[Baz Bahadur]] of Malwa and later, to the Mirzas of [[Sambhal]].{{sfn|Chandra|2005|pp=106,107}}\n\nAfter handling the rebellions of the Mirzas and the Uzbek nobles in 1567, Akbar turned his eyes towards Rajasthan and its prestigious kingdom of Mewar.{{sfn|Chandra|2005|p=106}}\n\nPrior to the siege, the Mughals under Asaf Khan and Wazir Khan attacked and conquered [[Mandalgarh]], where Rawat Balvi solanki was defeated.<ref>[https://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118 Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl]\"\u0100\u1e63af Kh\u0101n and Waz\u012br Kh\u0101n.. went... with orders to attack the fortress of M\u0101ndal...It was...defended by...Rawat Balv\u012b Solang\u012b....but the conquered it.\"</ref>\n\nOn 20 October 1567, he encamped near the fortress of Chittorgarh. Maharana Udai Singh II had already retreated from the fortress of Chittorgarh and went to Gogunda, leaving behind 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 musketeers under the command of Jaimal and Patta. After arriving at Chittorgarh,\nAkbar sent Asaf Khan to Rampur and Hussain Quli Khan to Udaipur and Kumbalgarh to plunder the Rana's territories.
