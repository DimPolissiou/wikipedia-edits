It was first released as a single in the UK in October 1982 and was subsequently included on the EP ''[[Blinded by Science]]'' and the second edition of Dolby's debut album ''[[The Golden Age of Wireless]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nAlthough viewed as a success in the United States, peaking at No. 5 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and 2 weeks at No. 1 in Canada's [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]], the song barely managed to score among the Top 50 in Dolby's native United Kingdom, peaking at No. 49 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nDolby is often considered a [[one-hit wonder]] in the United States on the basis of the song's chart success there. In 2002, US cable television network [[VH1]] named \"She Blinded Me with Science\" No. 20 on its list of the \"100 Greatest One-hit Wonders\".<ref name=\"onehit\">{{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/the_greatest/one_hit_wonders/list_20-1.jhtml |title=Greatest One Hit Wonders List > Hour 5: #20 \u2013 1 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040831035624/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/the_greatest/one_hit_wonders/list_20-1.jhtml |archivedate= 31 August 2004}}.

Various mad scientist types operate fanciful inventions on the grounds of the home and act insane with normal scientific items. Throughout the course of the video, [[Magnus Pyke]] (as the Home Doctor) tries to diagnose his ailment, all the while being seduced by Miss Sakamoto, a secretary in the home.\n\nDolby saw music videos with story lines as \"short silent films with a soundtrack\". The video for \"She Blinded Me with Science\" was conceived and storyboarded before the song was written.<ref>{{cite web|first= Dan |last= MacIntosh |title= Thomas Dolby : Songwriter Interviews |website= Songfacts |date= 16 March 2011 |access-date= 24 April 2017 |url= http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/thomas_dolby/}}</ref> Dolby added the song title and then wrote the song to fit the planned video.
