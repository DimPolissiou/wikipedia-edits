Filled with gentle reflections on love and loss, mixed in with the star bassist's signature sense of humour and funky beats, it is exactly the record the world needed.\" Barnabe praised Thundercat's implementation of humor elements on the album, particularly praising the song \"Dragonball Durag\". Barnabe further stated that the album \"manifests as a beautiful ebb and flow of emotional states, philosophical musings and plain old comedy.\"<ref name=\"exclaim-review\"/> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' favorably compared the album to its predecessor, ''Drunk'', stating that both records \"continue to reflect on Thundercat's acceptance of his own mortality, veering away from an almost-claustrophobic grief and into deeper contemplation.\"<ref name=\"independent-review\"/> Writing for ''[[NME]]'', Sam Moore stated that the album's \"magic moment comes as Thundercat links up with [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and '80s funk hero [[Steve Arrington]] on 'Black Qualls'; the disco-funk tune should be up for consideration as the best song of 2020. Its inclusion here gives a comforting indication that, for all of the album's heavy rumination on life, death and healing, Thundercat can still kick back when required.\" Moore comments on the album's lyrics which depicts a variety of themes, stating that \" Thundercat's lyrical reflections on grief, uncertainty and gradual healing are threaded through 'It Is What It Is'.\"<ref name=\"nme-review\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 37:38\n|headline = ''It Is What It Is'' track listing\n| title1 = Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26\n| length1 = 1:22\n\n| title2 = Innerstellar Love\n| length2 = 2:41\n\n| title3 = I Love Louis Cole\n| note3 = featuring [[Knower (duo)|Louis Cole]]\n| length3 = 3:24\n\n| title4 = Black Qualls\n| note4 = featuring [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Steve Arrington]] and [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]]\n| length4 = 3:10\n\n| title5 = Miguel's Happy Dance\n| length5 = 2:12\n\n| title6 = How Sway\n| length6 = 1:15\n\n| title7 = Funny Thing\n| length7 = 1:57\n\n| title8 = Overseas\n| note8 = featuring [[Zack Fox]]\n| length8 = 1:28\n\n| title9 = Dragonball Durag\n| length9 = 3:02\n\n| title10 = How I Feel\n| length10 = 1:08\n\n| title11 = King of the Hill\n| length11 = 2:52\n\n| title12 = Unrequited Love\n| length12 = 3:14\n\n| title13 = Fair Chance\n| note13 = featuring [[Ty Dolla Sign]] and [[Lil B]]\n| length13 = 3:58\n\n| title14 = Existential Dread\n| length14 = 0:52\n\n| title15 = It Is What It Is\n| note15 = featuring Pedro Martins\n| length15 = 5:03\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n{{col-start|width=75%}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Technical personnel'''\n* [[Flying Lotus]] \u2013\u00a0production, mixing\n* [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]] \u2013\u00a0production\n* [[Daddy Kev]] \u2013\u00a0mixing, mastering\n\n'''Artwork'''\n* Eddie Alcazar \u2013\u00a0photography\n* Adam Stover \u2013\u00a0layout, design\n* [[Zack Fox]] \u2013 gatefold artwork\n{{col-2}}\n'''Additional musicians'''\n* [[Kamasi Washington]]\n* [[BadBadNotGood]]\n* [[Miguel Atwood-Ferguson]]\n* [[Sounwave]]\n* [[Mono/Poly]]\n* Dennis Hamm\n* [[Ronald Bruner Jr.]]\n* Brandon Coleman\n* [[Taylor Graves]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Sales chart performance for ''It Is What It Is''\n|-\n!

Barnabe further stated that the album \"manifests as a beautiful ebb and flow of emotional states, philosophical musings and plain old comedy.\"<ref name=\"exclaim-review\"/> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' favorably compared the album to its predecessor, ''Drunk'', stating that both records \"continue to reflect on Thundercat's acceptance of his own mortality, veering away from an almost-claustrophobic grief and into deeper contemplation.\"<ref name=\"independent-review\"/> Writing for ''[[NME]]'', Sam Moore stated that the album's \"magic moment comes as Thundercat links up with [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]] and \u201880s funk hero [[Steve Arrington]] on 'Black Qualls'; the disco-funk tune should be up for consideration as the best song of 2020. Its inclusion here gives a comforting indication that, for all of the album's heavy rumination on life, death and healing, Thundercat can still kick back when required.\" Moore comments on the album's lyrics which depicts a variety of themes, stating that \" Thundercat's lyrical reflections on grief, uncertainty and gradual healing are threaded through 'It Is What It Is'.\"<ref name=\"nme-review\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 37:38\n|headline = ''It Is What It Is'' track listing\n| title1 = Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26\n| length1 = 1:22\n\n| title2 = Innerstellar Love\n| length2 = 2:41\n\n| title3 = I Love Louis Cole\n| note3 = featuring [[Knower (duo)|Louis Cole]]\n| length3 = 3:24\n\n| title4 = Black Qualls\n| note4 = featuring [[Steve Lacy (guitarist)|Steve Lacy]], [[Steve Arrington]] and [[Donald Glover|Childish Gambino]]\n| length4 = 3:10\n\n| title5 = Miguel's Happy Dance\n| length5 = 2:12\n\n| title6 = How Sway\n| length6 = 1:15\n\n| title7 = Funny Thing\n| length7 = 1:57\n\n| title8 = Overseas\n| note8 = featuring [[Zack Fox]]\n| length8 = 1:28\n\n| title9 = Dragonball Durag\n| length9 = 3:02\n\n| title10 = How I Feel\n| length10 = 1:08\n\n| title11 = King of the Hill\n| length11 = 2:52\n\n| title12 = Unrequited Love\n| length12 = 3:14\n\n| title13 = Fair Chance\n| note13 = featuring [[Ty Dolla Sign]] and [[Lil B]]\n| length13 = 3:58\n\n| title14 = Existential Dread\n| length14 = 0:52\n\n| title15 = It Is What It Is\n| note15 = featuring Pedro Martins\n| length15 = 5:03\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n{{col-start|width=75%}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Technical personnel'''\n* [[Flying Lotus]] \u2013\u00a0production, mixing\n* [[Thundercat (musician)|Thundercat]] \u2013\u00a0production\n* [[Daddy Kev]] \u2013\u00a0mixing, mastering\n\n'''Artwork'''\n* Eddie Alcazar \u2013\u00a0photography\n* Adam Stover \u2013\u00a0layout, design\n* [[Zack Fox]] \u2013 gatefold artwork\n{{col-2}}\n'''Additional musicians'''\n* [[Kamasi Washington]]\n* [[BadBadNotGood]]\n* [[Miguel Atwood-Ferguson]]\n* [[Sounwave]]\n* [[Mono/Poly]]\n* Dennis Hamm\n* [[Ronald Bruner Jr.]]\n* Brandon Coleman\n* [[Taylor Graves]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Sales chart performance for ''It Is What It Is''\n|-\n!

In 1989 appeared an unofficial revision by German publishing house Gute Botschaft Verlag (GBV); it tried to get the existing translation closer to the original manuscripts, in a form grammatically corrected and adapted according to the evolution of the modern Romanian language.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), operating in Romania through the Interconfessional Bible Society of Romania ([http://societateabiblica.org/ SBIR]), brought out a special 90th anniversary definitive edition of the Cornilescu Bible in 2014, with many errors corrected.\n\n*[[Petru Pavel Aron]]\n*[[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] - into [[Romanian language|Romanian]]\n*[[Dumitru Cornilescu]] - Protestant, translated into Romanian\n*[[Gala Galaction]] - Romanian Orthodox, translated into Romanian\n*[[Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu]] - translated into Romanian\n\n== Comparison ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Translation\n![[Gospel of John|John]] (Ioan) 3:16\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Cornilescu'' (1924)\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00eet de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul Lui Fiu, pentruca oricine crede \u00een El, s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 vecinic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Cornilescu'' (2014)<ref>Revised edition.</ref>\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00e2t de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul Lui Fiu, pentru ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163a ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Biblia GBV'' (1989)\n|Fiindc\u0103 at\u00eet de mult a iubit Dumnezeu lumea, c\u0103 a dat pe singurul S\u0103u Fiu, pentru ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|''Biblia Sinodal\u0103'' [http://www.bibliaortodoxa.ro/ Biblia Ortodox\u0103 Online]\n|C\u0103ci Dumnezeu a\u015fa a iubit lumea, \u00eenc\u00e2t pe Fiul S\u0103u Cel Unul-N\u0103scut L-a dat ca oricine crede \u00een El s\u0103 nu piar\u0103, ci s\u0103 aib\u0103 via\u0163\u0103 ve\u015fnic\u0103.\n|}\n\n== False friends ==\n\nThe Orthodox Bibles in the Romanian language, including the Cornilescu translation, which was initially intended and published as if it were an Orthodox translation<ref name=\"Vaisamar 2009\">{{cite web | first=Emanuel | last=Con\u021bac | title=Neadev\u0103ruri nerevizuite \u00een \u201eCornilescu\u201d (2003) revizuit | website=Vaisamar | date=6 May 2009 | url=http://vaisamar.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/neadevaruri-nerevizuite-in-cornilescu-2003-revizuit/ | language=ro | access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref>, use the term \"Malachians\"<ref name=\"Nicodim2016\">{{cite book|author=Aghioritul Sf\u00e2ntul Nicodim|title=Carte foarte folositoare de suflet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkSTDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT99|date=14 June 2016|publisher=Elefant Online|isbn=978-606-8622-22-4|page=99}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Alexandru|last=Moisiu|publisher=University of California|title=Cartea regulei pastorale : cartea grijii pastorale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x64wAAAAIAAJ|year=1987|page=173}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Ioan Irineu|last=F\u0103rca\u0219|title=El, \"S-a de\u0219ertat pe Sine\" (FIL. 2,7). kenosa, centrul, sensul \u0219i \u021binta teologiei.|volume=46|issue=2|journal=Studia Universitatis Babe\u0219-Bolyai: Theologia Graeco-Catholica Varadiensis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6dAAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Universitatea Babe\u0219-Bolyai|page=56}}</ref> or \"Malacians\" (ie \"those who masturbate\") for those who will not inherit the kingdom of heaven (1 Cor. 6: 9).<ref name=\"Vaisamar 2008\"/> According to Emanuel Con\u021bac and Chrys C.

The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

As a result, the pressurization of the system 100 ms before firing damaged a check valve and resulted in the explosion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-explosion-destroyed-crew-dragon-spacecraft-blamed-on-leaking-valve/|title=Explosion that destroyed SpaceX Crew Dragon is blamed on leaking valve |website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref><ref name =\"spacex_explosion_update\"/>\n\nSince the destroyed capsule had been slated for use in the upcoming in-flight abort test, the explosion and investigation delayed that test and the subsequent crewed orbital test.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.journalpioneer.com/news/world/nasa-boss-says-no-doubt-spacex-explosion-delays-flight-program-323465/|title=NASA boss says no doubt SpaceX explosion delays flight program|date=June 18, 2019 |access-date=June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe SuperDraco engine test that failed on 20 April 2019 was repeated successfully on 13 November 2019. The full duration static fire test of Crew Dragon's launch escape system took place at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at SpaceX's Landing zone 1 at 20:08 UTC. The test was successful, showing that the modifications made to the vehicle to prevent a failure like the one that happened 20 April were successful. The vehicle used for this ground test will also be used for the following in-flight abort test.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/11/13/spacex-fires-up-crew-dragon-thrusters-in-key-test-after-april-explosion/</ref>\n\nSome of the modifications are:\n\n* Replacement of the valves with [[burst disc]]s: Unlike valves, burst discs are designed for single use. \n* Addition of flaps on each SuperDraco in order to reseal the thrusters prior to splashdown in the ocean, preventing water intrusion.<ref>https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-fires-redesigned-crew-dragon-superdraco-flaps/</ref>\n\n===In-Flight Abort Test===\n{{main|Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test}}\n[[File:KSC-20200119-PH-AWG04 0008.jpg|thumb|Liftoff of Crew Dragon In-Flight Abort Test.]]\n\nThe Crew Dragon In-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39A]] on a [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the [[troposphere]] at [[transonic]] velocities shortly after passing through [[Max q|max Q]], where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its [[SuperDraco]] abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller [[SpaceX Draco|Draco]] engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing.

Dragon|Dragon]] [[cargo spacecraft]]. The spacecraft launches atop a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean [[splashdown]]. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  It has two variants; '''Crew Dragon''', a [[Human-rating certification|human-rated]] [[Space capsule|capsule]] capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and '''Cargo Dragon''', an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated [[launch escape system]] in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two [[SuperDraco]] engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar arrays]] and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new [[flight computer]]s and [[avionics]]. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named ''[[SpaceX DragonFly|Dragonfly]]'' and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.\n\nCrew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that will shuttle crews to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) under [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Crew Program]], the other being the [[Boeing CST-100 Starliner]]. It will also be used in flights by American [[space tourism]] company [[Space Adventures]] and to shuttle tourists to and from [[Axiom Space]]'s planned space station. Crew Dragon's [[Crew Dragon Demo-1|first non-piloted test flight]] occurred in March 2019, and its [[Crew Dragon Demo-2|first crewed flight]] \u2013 with astronauts [[Robert L. Behnken]] and [[Douglas G. Hurley]] \u2013 is planned to occur in May 2020. Cargo Dragon will [[space logistics|supply cargo]] to the ISS under a [[Commercial Resupply Services#Commercial Resupply Services 2|Commercial Resupply Services-2]] contract with NASA, along with [[Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems]]' [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] spacecraft and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]] spacecraft. The [[SpaceX CRS-21|first flight]] of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.\n\n== Development and variants==\n[[File:Dragon V2 01.png|thumb|The depictions of the Crew Dragon's 2014 design from various angles.

She later submitted herself to Arata in order to escape the world that she created to trap Mira and Arata.

Later, she was 'reborn' to become the member of Iscariot, which seeks to destroy the cycle of the Demon Lord and the Trinity Seven, destroying the world and the rebirth of the world. Although she becomes Arata's enemy, she still values Arata more highly than anything and wishes to make a world Arata could enjoy freely. She is referred to as the \"Fallen Saint\" by Anastasia-L during their encounter. She is a magus of the Ira (Anger) archive with the themas Ruina (Ruin or Destruction), Partum (Birth or Creation), and Analysis (Disassembly).\n\n===Trinity Seven===\n====Lilith Asami====\n;{{Nihongo|Lilith Asami|\u6d45\u898b \u30ea\u30ea\u30b9|Asami Ririsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Kayano]] (drama CD), [[Yumi Hara]] (anime)|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Trinity Seven of Luxuria (Lust) and her magic Outer Alchemic ({{Ruby-ja|\u932c\u91d1\u8853|\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30b1\u30df\u30c3\u30af}}) materializes in the form of a gun which comes in two versions: a short pistol that she utilizes in close quarter combat and a long rifle that resembles an anti-tank gun which she uses at long range. Although she is the same age as Arata and wears the same uniform as the rest of the female students of Royal Biblia Academy, she is actually a teacher of the academy. She is the first magus to appear in front of Arata during the Black Sun gravitational phenomenon incident in Arata's world where she was sent to investigate it; this incident eventually led her to introducing him to the academy. She becomes one of his earliest allies and friend, watching and supporting him in any way, though at times she becomes an unwitting victim of his unintended and indirect perversion. As she is rather prudish, her thema is Abies ({{Ruby-ja|\u751f\u547d|\u30a2\u30d3\u30a8\u30b9}}, Life) from the Luxuria (Lust) archive. According to Hijiri, she is considered a prodigy and is the youngest to join the Trinity Seven.  \n\n====Arin Kannazuki====\n;{{Nihongo|Arin Kannazuki|\u795e\u7121\u6708 \u30a2\u30ea\u30f3|Kannazuki Arin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Shitaya]] (drama CD), [[Aya Uchida]] (anime)|Christina Stroup}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Trinity Seven of Ira (Anger) and user of Chaotic Rune magic, whose appearance is strikingly similar to Hijiri. She has a stoic personality where she has no reservation or shame about doing what she wants in front of Arata. She was first seen naked in the boys' bathroom when Arata went in for a bath. She is also the Demon Lord's partner, becoming an early ally and later close friend to Arata. She claims herself to be Arata's wife as he is the Demon Lord candidate. As she only shows little emotion much less and can't even imagine destructive anger, her thema is Ruina ({{Ruby-ja|\u5d29\u58ca|\u30eb\u30a4\u30fc\u30ca}}, Ruin or Destruction) from the Ira (Anger) Archive. Her magic Chaosic Rune ({{Ruby-ja|\u8056\u5100\u8853|\u30ab\u30aa\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30f3}}), allows her to put up barriers and create destruction.\n\n====Levi Kazama====\n;{{Nihongo|Levi Kazama|\u98a8\u9593 \u30ec\u30f4\u30a3|Kazama Revi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Saki Fujita]] (drama CD), [[Ayane Sakura]] (anime)|[[Carli Mosier]]}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is a ninja and the Trinity Seven of Invidia, as well as a student at the Royal Biblia Academy.

She is the only member of the Trinity Seven that hasn't been seen naked by Arata, and her naked body is considered by Arata to be his \"final frontier\". She often desires to fight Akio in a one-on-one fight, but has never had the opportunity to do so. Due to being a ninja, who often works alone, she doesn't expect anything from others and thus her thema is Expectatio ({{Ruby-ja|\u671f\u5f85|\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8}}, Expectation) from the Invidia (Envy) Archive.\n\n====Mira Yamana====\n;{{Nihongo|Mira Yamana|\u5c71\u5948 \u30df\u30e9|Yamana Mira}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Suzuko Mimori]] (drama CD), [[Y\u014dko Hikasa]] (anime)|Chelsea McCurdy}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Head of Grimoire Security ({{Ruby-ja|\u738b\u7acb\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u691c\u95b2\u5b98|\u30b0\u30ea\u30e2\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3}}, lit. \"Royal Library censor(ate)\") and one of the Trinity Seven. She treats Arata with hostility, but later warms up to Arata during the investigation of the Liber Academy's disappearance where they are stuck in the world created by Ilya. Her orb is her grimoire. Her thema is Justitia (Justice), which is part of the Superbia (Pride or hubris) archive, like Arata. It allows her to activate the \"Gehenna Scope\" ({{Ruby-ja|\u6620\u6676\u8853|\u30b2\u30d8\u30ca\u30fb\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7}}) which she uses to analyse and counter any magic.\n\n====Akio Fud\u014d====\n;{{Nihongo|Akio Fud\u014d|\u4e0d\u52d5 \u30a2\u30ad\u30aa|Fud\u014d Akio}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]}} (drama CD), [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]] (anime); Patricia Duran (English)\n:Akio Fudo is the partner of Mira in operating Grimoire Security as well as a member of the Trinity Seven.

Her mother had sufficient power to save only one person and chose Akio, making her the only survivor of her home town. In the process, she lost her faith, so that her thema is Fides ({{Ruby-ja|\u4fe1\u4ef0|\u30d5\u30a3\u30c7\u30b9}}, Faith), which is part of the Gula (Gluttony) archive. Her magic Mantra Enchant ({{Ruby-ja|\u771f\u8a00\u8853|\u30de\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30c8}}) gives her superior physical skills, which she uses for close combat.\n\n====Yui Kurata====\n;{{Nihongo|Yui Kurata|\u5009\u7530 \u30e6\u30a4|Kurata Yui}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rumi \u014ckubo]] (drama CD), [[Rie Murakawa]] (anime)| Cynthia Martinez}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is a special magus who lives in the dungeon underneath the academy and is also a member of the Trinity Seven.

Later, when she was rescued by Arata and other Trinity Seven members, Yui is able to return to a normal life with other people and Levi as her close friend. She constantly shows her affection to Arata. She is known to be a Cardinal-Class magus, second only to the Biblia Academy headmaster. As she secludes herself from others, her thema is Amicitia ({{Ruby-ja|\u53cb\u60c5|\u30a2\u30df\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2}}, Friendship), which is part of the Avaritia (Greed) archive.

She is a magus of the Ira (Anger) archive with the themas Ruina (Ruin or Destruction), Partum (Birth or Creation), and Analysis (Disassembly).\n\n===Trinity Seven===\n====Lilith Asami====\n;{{Nihongo|Lilith Asami|\u6d45\u898b \u30ea\u30ea\u30b9|Asami Ririsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ai Kayano]] (drama CD), [[Yumi Hara]] (anime)|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Trinity Seven of Luxuria (Lust) and her magic Outer Alchemic ({{Ruby-ja|\u932c\u91d1\u8853|\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30b1\u30df\u30c3\u30af}}) materializes in the form of a gun which comes in two versions: a short pistol that she utilizes in close quarter combat and a long rifle that resembles an anti-tank gun which she uses at long range. Although she is the same age as Arata and wears the same uniform as the rest of the female students of Royal Biblia Academy, she is actually a teacher of the academy. She is the first magus to appear in front of Arata during the Black Sun gravitational phenomenon incident in Arata's world where she was sent to investigate it; this incident eventually led her to introducing him to the academy. She becomes one of his earliest allies and friend, watching and supporting him in any way, though at times she becomes an unwitting victim of his unintended and indirect perversion. As she is rather prudish, her thema is Abies ({{Ruby-ja|\u751f\u547d|\u30a2\u30d3\u30a8\u30b9}}, Life) from the Luxuria (Lust) archive. According to Hijiri, she is considered a prodigy and is the youngest to join the Trinity Seven.  \n\n====Arin Kannazuki====\n;{{Nihongo|Arin Kannazuki|\u795e\u7121\u6708 \u30a2\u30ea\u30f3|Kannazuki Arin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Noriko Shitaya]] (drama CD), [[Aya Uchida]] (anime)|Christina Stroup}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Trinity Seven of Ira (Anger) and user of Chaotic Rune magic, whose appearance is strikingly similar to Hijiri. She has a stoic personality where she has no reservation or shame about doing what she wants in front of Arata. She was first seen naked in the boys' bathroom when Arata went in for a bath. She is also the Demon Lord's partner, becoming an early ally and later close friend to Arata. She claims herself to be Arata's wife as he is the Demon Lord candidate. As she only shows little emotion much less and can't even imagine destructive anger, her thema is Ruina ({{Ruby-ja|\u5d29\u58ca|\u30eb\u30a4\u30fc\u30ca}}, Ruin or Destruction) from the Ira (Anger) Archive. Her magic Chaosic Rune ({{Ruby-ja|\u8056\u5100\u8853|\u30ab\u30aa\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30f3}}), allows her to put up barriers and create destruction.\n\n====Levi Kazama====\n;{{Nihongo|Levi Kazama|\u98a8\u9593 \u30ec\u30f4\u30a3|Kazama Revi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Saki Fujita]] (drama CD), [[Ayane Sakura]] (anime)|[[Carli Mosier]]}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is a ninja and the Trinity Seven of Invidia, as well as a student at the Royal Biblia Academy.

She is the only member of the Trinity Seven that hasn't been seen naked by Arata, and her naked body is considered by Arata to be his \"final frontier\". She often desires to fight Akio in a one-on-one fight, but has never had the opportunity to do so. Due to being a ninja, who often works alone, she doesn't expect anything from others and thus her thema is Expectatio ({{Ruby-ja|\u671f\u5f85|\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30af\u30c8}}, Expectation) from the Invidia (Envy) Archive.\n\n====Mira Yamana====\n;{{Nihongo|Mira Yamana|\u5c71\u5948 \u30df\u30e9|Yamana Mira}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Suzuko Mimori]] (drama CD), [[Y\u014dko Hikasa]] (anime)|Chelsea McCurdy}}<ref name=\"dubcast\" />\n:She is the Head of Grimoire Security ({{Ruby-ja|\u738b\u7acb\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u691c\u95b2\u5b98|\u30b0\u30ea\u30e2\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3}}, lit. \"Royal Library censor(ate)\") and one of the Trinity Seven.

traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.

traditional state in [[Nsukka]] Local Government Area of [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. With a culturally rich, stable traditional political system and institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani <ref>Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html</ref> but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible entity.\n\nEdem has an area of {{convert|50.492|km2|abbr=on}} with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points.  The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006.\n\nEdem shares common borders with [[Obimo]] on the south, [[Nsukka]] on the east, [[Ibagwa Ani]] on the north, and Nrobo on the west.  Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani.\n\nThe people of Edem are from the [[Igala people|Igala]] ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones.  Due to their ancestry and proximity to [[Northern Nigeria]], as well as their location in the northern part of [[Igboland]], they are referred to as Northern Igbos. \n\n==Composition of Edem==\nEdem is made up of 38 villages:\n\n'''Akpa-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Oba\n* Amadiuba\n* Amadimogo\n* Amankwa\n* Dimunazu\n* Igoro Agbo\n* Igoro Ugwu\n* Isamani\n* Nkawushi\n* Okiti\n* Owa-Edem\n* Uwenu Na Uwani Obeke\n\n'''Ozi-Edem Zone'''\n\n* Ama Uwenu\n* Amabunegu\n* Amamkpume\n* Amaudo\n* Amaukpa\n* Amaukwa\n* Dimoke\n* Ikwe Ezike\n* Obinegun \n* Ukpara\n* Umueyi\n* Umuoji\n* Umoko\n\n'''Edem-Ani Zone'''\n\n* Amaenu-Edem\n* Amaezumesu\n* Amaogwu\n* Isu\n* Nkofi\n* Odojo\n* Ogbododu\n* Owere-Ugwu\n* Owereagbo\n* Ozara\n* Ubogidi\n* Umuchiagwu\n* Umuchioke\n* Uwani-Edem\nEach of the villages is headed by an [[Onyishi]] according to their culture and traditions.\n\n==Life and Religion==\nEdem is known for having [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indigene#English indigenes] that live very long, frequently over 100 years.

When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of \"undetermined craniocerebral injuries.\" The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a moving head striking a stationary object.

Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote at the time that the case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise.

When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of \"undetermined craniocerebral injuries.\" The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a moving head striking a stationary object. Autopsy findings show Argentino suffered more than two dozen cuts and bruises \u2014 a possible sign of serious domestic abuse \u2014 on her head, ear, chin, arms, hands, back, buttocks, legs, and feet. Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote at the time that the case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise. Deputy Lehigh County coroner Wayne Snyder later said, \"Upon viewing the body and speaking to the pathologist, I immediately suspected [[crime|foul play]] and so notified the district attorney.\"<ref name=fresh>{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-06-28/news/mc-allentown-jimmy-snuka-grand-jury-20130628_1_nancy-argentino-argentino-family-motel-room|title=DA taking 'fresh look' at death of 'Superfly' Snuka mistress| work= The Morning Call|last1= Clark| first1= Adam| first2= Kevin| last2= Amerman|accessdate=August 8, 2015|date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSnuka was the only suspect involved in the subsequent investigation.
