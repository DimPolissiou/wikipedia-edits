The Mary Starke Harper Geriatric Psychiatry Hospital, a separate facility on the same campus, provides an additional 100 beds for inpatient geriatric care.  The main facility was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe plans for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the \"moral architecture\" concepts of 1830s activists [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]] and [[Dorothea Dix]]. Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the hospital. Architect [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]] designed the Italianate building using the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. Construction of the building began in 1853 but was not completed until 1859. The hospital was the first building in Tuscaloosa with gas lighting and central heat,<ref name=\"EOA\">{{cite web | title=Bryce Hospital (Alabama Insane Hospital) | url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1564 | last=Weaver |first=Bill | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Alabama | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=March 26, 2009}}</ref> \"all clad in a fashionable Italianate exterior.\"<ref name=\"bridging\"/>\n\nThe Alabama Insane Hospital opened in 1861.  It was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, who had first begun as a 27-year-old [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] pioneer from [[South Carolina]]. Bryce had been brought to the attention of the hospital trustees by Dix. He had studied mental-health care in Europe and worked in psychiatric hospitals in [[New Jersey]], as well as his native state of South Carolina.<ref name=\"EOA\"/>  His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, [[straitjacket]]s and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called ''[[The Meteor]]''. These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to \"scientific treatments\" was recognized around the country as being in a class of its own.\n\n==Decline==\nDuring the 20th century, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor [[Lurleen Wallace]] viewed the facility in February 1967, and was moved to tears after an overweight, mentally challenged nine-year-old attempted to hug her, crying, \"Mama! Mama!\" She lobbied her husband, [[George Wallace]] (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{Cite book\n  | last = Carter\n  | first = Dan T.\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics\n  | publisher = Louisiana State UP\n  | year = 2000\n  | location = Baton Rouge\n  | page = 336\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJWtbRNdoqgC&pg=PA336\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-8071-2597-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Alabama ranked last among [[U.S. state]]s in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' editor likened to a [[concentration camp]]. That same year, a [[cigarette]] tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Alabama]] attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M. Johnson]] ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected.\n\n==''Wyatt v. Stickney''==\n\nIn October 1970, Ricky Wyatt, a fifteen-year-old who had always been labeled a \"juvenile delinquent\" and housed at Bryce despite not being indicated with a mental illness, became the named plaintiff in a [[class-action]] lawsuit.<ref name=\"Wyatt\">{{citation | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2375 | title=Encyclopedia of Alabama | year=2009}}</ref> His aunt, W. C. Rawlins, was one of the employees who had been laid off. Together they testified about intolerable conditions and improper treatments designed only to make the patients more manageable. In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, [[Searcy Hospital]] ([[Mount Vernon, Alabama|Mt. Vernon]]) and Camp Partlow ([[Coker, Alabama|Coker]]).

The main facility was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe plans for a state hospital for the mentally ill in Alabama began in 1852. The new facility was planned from the start to utilize the \"moral architecture\" concepts of 1830s activists [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]] and [[Dorothea Dix]]. Dix's reformist ideas, in particular, are credited as the driving force behind the construction of the hospital. Architect [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]] designed the Italianate building using the [[Kirkbride Plan]]. Construction of the building began in 1853 but was not completed until 1859. The hospital was the first building in Tuscaloosa with gas lighting and central heat,<ref name=\"EOA\">{{cite web | title=Bryce Hospital (Alabama Insane Hospital) | url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1564 | last=Weaver |first=Bill | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Alabama | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=March 26, 2009}}</ref> \"all clad in a fashionable Italianate exterior.\"<ref name=\"bridging\"/>\n\nThe Alabama Insane Hospital opened in 1861.  It was later renamed for its first superintendent, Peter Bryce, who had first begun as a 27-year-old [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] pioneer from [[South Carolina]]. Bryce had been brought to the attention of the hospital trustees by Dix. He had studied mental-health care in Europe and worked in psychiatric hospitals in [[New Jersey]], as well as his native state of South Carolina.<ref name=\"EOA\"/>  His tenure was marked by absolute discipline among the staff of the hospital. He demanded that patients be given courtesy, kindness and respect at all times. The use of shackles, [[straitjacket]]s and other restraints was discouraged, and finally abandoned altogether in 1882. Various work programs and other activities were encouraged, including farming, sewing, maintenance and crafts. Between 1872 and the early 1880s, some of the patients wrote and edited their own newspaper, called ''[[The Meteor]]''. These writings provide a rare inside look at life in a progressive mental institution in the late 19th century. At that time, Bryce's management and commitment to \"scientific treatments\" was recognized around the country as being in a class of its own.\n\n==Decline==\nDuring the 20th century, the patient population expanded while standards of care fell to abysmal levels. Alabama Governor [[Lurleen Wallace]] viewed the facility in February 1967, and was moved to tears after an overweight, mentally challenged nine-year-old attempted to hug her, crying, \"Mama! Mama!\" She lobbied her husband, [[George Wallace]] (who held the actual power of her governorship) for more funds for the institution.<ref name=\"Carter\">{{Cite book\n  | last = Carter\n  | first = Dan T.\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = The politics of rage: George Wallace, the origins of the new conservatism, and the transformation of American politics\n  | publisher = Louisiana State UP\n  | year = 2000\n  | location = Baton Rouge\n  | page = 336\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJWtbRNdoqgC&pg=PA336\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-8071-2597-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Alabama ranked last among [[U.S. state]]s in funding for mental health. Bryce Hospital at that time had 5,200 patients living in conditions that a ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' editor likened to a [[concentration camp]]. That same year, a [[cigarette]] tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Alabama]] attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M. Johnson]] ruled that the courts had no standing to intervene on behalf of fired employees. He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected.\n\n==''Wyatt v. Stickney''==\n\nIn October 1970, Ricky Wyatt, a fifteen-year-old who had always been labeled a \"juvenile delinquent\" and housed at Bryce despite not being indicated with a mental illness, became the named plaintiff in a [[class-action]] lawsuit.<ref name=\"Wyatt\">{{citation | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2375 | title=Encyclopedia of Alabama | year=2009}}</ref> His aunt, W. C. Rawlins, was one of the employees who had been laid off. Together they testified about intolerable conditions and improper treatments designed only to make the patients more manageable. In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, [[Searcy Hospital]] ([[Mount Vernon, Alabama|Mt. Vernon]]) and Camp Partlow ([[Coker, Alabama|Coker]]). The resulting court-ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardations who reside in institutional settings. In 1999 a new [[settlement agreement]] was made, recognizing a great deal of progress. The case was finally dismissed on December 5, 2003, with the finding by Judge [[Myron Thompson]] that Alabama was in compliance with the agreement.\n\nThe standards elaborated in that agreement have served as a model nationwide.

After years of [[rationing]] and wartime austerity, the book brought light and colour<ref name=DicksonWright450/> back to [[English cuisine|English cooking]], with simple fresh ingredients,<ref name=DicksonWright450/> from David's experience of [[Mediterranean cooking]] while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], and the chapters were introduced with quotations from famous writers.\n\nAt the time, many ingredients were scarcely obtainable, but the book was quickly recognised as serious, and within a few years it profoundly changed English cooking and eating habits.<ref name=NYT1992/>\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Britain Queues For Food- Rationing and Food Shortages in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1945 D24983.jpg|thumb|The reality of [[rationing]] and austerity: queuing for fish in London, 1945]]\n\nReturning to postwar England, still with food [[rationing]], after years living in the Mediterranean with its wealth of fresh ingredients, [[Elizabeth David]] found life grey and daunting. The food was terrible: \"There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper; bread and gristle rissoles; dehydrated onions and carrots; corned beef [[toad in the hole]]. I need not go on.\"<ref name=ogw21>David (1986), p. 21</ref>\n\n==Book==\nPartly to earn some money, and partly from an \"agonized craving for the sun\", David began writing articles on [[Mediterranean cookery]].<ref name=ogw21/> Her first efforts were published in 1949 in the British edition of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. From the outset, David refused to sell the copyright of her articles, and so she was able to collect and edit them for publication in book form.<ref>David (1986), p. 14</ref> Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume and submitted it to a series of publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F9FC |salign=center | quote = With this selection...of Mediterranean dishes, I hope to give some idea of the lovely cookery of those regions to people who do not already know them, and to stir the memories of those who have eaten this food on its native shores, and who would like sometimes to bring a flavour of those blessed lands of sun and sea and olive trees into their English kitchens. | source = [[Elizabeth David]], Preface.| align=left| width=33%}}\n\nDavid took this advice, but, conscious of her inexperience as a writer, she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. In the published volume, the sections are linked by substantial extracts from works by writers including [[Norman Douglas]], [[Lawrence Durrell]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Osbert Sitwell]], [[Compton Mackenzie]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Henry James]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]].<ref>David (1999), p. vii</ref> She submitted the revised typescript to [[John Lehmann]], a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery, but he accepted it, agreeing to an advance payment of \u00a3100. ''A Book of Mediterranean Food'' was published in 1950.<ref name=c144>Cooper, p. 144</ref> Lehmann had suggested it be named \"The Blue Train Cookery Book\", since he supposed that the romance of Mediterranean countries was to be found in the exciting train journeys to reach them.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Our Summer 2000 Books |journal=The Persephone Quarterly |date=2000 |volume=6 |issue=Summer 2000 |page=4 |url=http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/newsletters/2000-No.06-Summer.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe book appeared when food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained fully in force in Britain. As David later put it, \"almost every essential ingredient of good cooking was either rationed or unobtainable.\"<ref name=dix>David (1999), p. ix</ref> She therefore adapted some of the recipes she had learned during the years when she lived in Mediterranean countries, \"to make up for lack of flavour which should have been supplied by meat or stock or butter.\"<ref name=dix/>\n\n===Lyricism===\nThe historian of food [[Panikos Panayi]] argues that with ''A Book of Mediterranean Food'', David profoundly changed English cooking. He considers the opening section to contain \"perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing\":<ref name=Panayi191>Panayi, 2010, pp. 191\u2013195</ref>\n\n{{quote|The cooking of the Mediterranean shores, endowed with all the natural resources, the colour and flavour of the South, is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation. The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans. It is honest cooking too; none of the sham Grand Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel<ref name=Panayi191/>}}\n\nDavid then describes the region and its perfumes:\n\n{{quote|From Gibraltar to the Bosphorous, down the [[Rhone Valley]], through the great seaports of [[Marseilles]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Genoa]] ... stretches the influence of Mediterranean cooking, conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants.

From the outset, David refused to sell the copyright of her articles, and so she was able to collect and edit them for publication in book form.<ref>David (1986), p. 14</ref> Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume and submitted it to a series of publishers, all of whom turned it down.

David adds to this section suggestions for [[hors d'oeuvres]], including Greek dishes then unfamiliar in Britain including [[dolma|dolm\u00e1d\u00e9s]] and [[Taramasalata|taram\u00e1]], as well as traditional French recipes such as ''sardines marin\u00e9es \u00e0 la ni\u00e7oise''.<ref>David (1999), p. 148\u2013158</ref>\n\nIn the section on sweets, David comments that throughout the Mediterranean countries, the more complicated sweets are very often bought from [[p\u00e2tisserie]]s; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as ''torrijas'' (also called ''[[pain perdu]]'') and cold orange souffl\u00e9.<ref>David (1999), 166\u2013173</ref> The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as pears and plums.<ref>David (1999), 178\u2013181</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter, on sauces, David includes classics like [[B\u00e9chamel sauce|b\u00e9chamel]], [[B\u00e9arnaise sauce|b\u00e9arnaise]], [[Hollandaise sauce|hollandaise]] and [[mayonnaise]] (which, she advises, \"stir steadily but not like a maniac\").

All the same, the recipes were \"honest\", \"collected in Provence, Italy, Corsica, Malta and Greece\", and the book was \"acclaimed as a serious work\".

She comments that the cookery writer [[Jane Grigson]], a \"devotee\", said \"Basil was no more than the name of bachelor uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti ... Then came Elizabeth David, like sunshine.\" McDonagh adds that David \"was one of the first and much the classiest of the personality food writers, even though she was never a telly chef: paving the way for [[Jamie Oliver|Jamie]], [[Nigella Lawson|Nigella]], [[Nigel Slater|Nigel]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|Hugh F-W]].\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McDonagh |first1=Melanie |title=Elizabeth David: The writer who transformed British life |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10454189/Elizabeth-David-The-writer-who-transformed-British-life.html |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 April 2015 |date=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nDissenting from the general acclaim, Tom Norrington-Davies, also writing in ''The Telegraph'', argues that the book \"reached only a very small section of the population\", but at once qualifies this, stating that these readers were \"undergoing a dramatic upheaval. Educated, moderately wealthy women suddenly found themselves in their kitchens without [[servant]]s\".
