Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when [[solicitor]] Brian Burgess informed her that a [[will and testament|will]] had been made, apparently by her mother; there were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left \u00a3386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict, and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, examination of his computer showed that they were written after her death.

The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left \u00a3386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients.

{"title_page": "Abortion in New Jersey", "text_new": "'''[[Abortion]] in New Jersey''' is legal.  Abortion related laws were drafted by the legislature by the end of the 1900s.\u00a0 These laws would be addressed in court during the 1800s as they related to application in prosecutions of women for having abortions. During the 1940s, hospitals created committees to approve abortion requests with the goal of trying to reduce the number of abortions performed at them.\n\n<br />\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Main|Abortion}}{{See also|Definitions of abortion}}The abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref group=\"note\">According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Katie|date=20 Dec 2019|title=Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175|accessdate=17 May 2019|pmid=30585581|volume=20|pages=E1175-1180|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-abortion movement|Anti-abortion]] advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|year=2007|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|journal=The Public Eye Magazine|volume=14|issue=1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&sq=infanticide \"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\".] ''New York Times.''

Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one.
