Instead the Media Buzz dividends would open up to allow all footballers on the Index to win Media Dividends. The change will take place as of the start of the 2019-20 season.\n\nOn 26 March 2019, Football Index implemented a Share Split with increased dividend structure. This meant every share owned by investors, were split by a value of 3. E.g. Pre Share Split a investor owned 1 x \u00a330 share in player A, Post Share Split the investor will then had 3 x \u00a310 shares in the same player A. This ultimately causes affordability for users to buy more, or allow smaller spenders to afford the more expensive players-where previously they were out of reach. Liquidity was gained where more people would buy, then more selling and overall more trading. With the Share Split happening, the yield with the changes in the dividend structure also increased by an average of 28% allowing more profitability.\n\nThe aftermath of the Share Split on 26 March 2019 saw huge investments.

This meant every share owned by investors, were split by a value of 3. E.g. Pre Share Split a investor owned 1 x \u00a330 share in player A, Post Share Split the investor will then had 3 x \u00a310 shares in the same player A. This ultimately causes affordability for users to buy more, or allow smaller spenders to afford the more expensive players-where previously they were out of reach. Liquidity was gained where more people would buy, then more selling and overall more trading. With the Share Split happening, the yield with the changes in the dividend structure also increased by an average of 28% allowing more profitability.\n\nThe aftermath of the Share Split on 26 March 2019 saw huge investments.

The term \"Byzantine\" is a modern designation to describe the Eastern Roman Empire, particularly after the major political restructuring of the seventh and eighth century. The [[Arab]]s, therefore, naturally called them \"the R\u00fbm\", their territory \"the land of the R\u00fbm\" and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] \"the Sea of the R\u00fbm\". They called Ancient Greece by the name \"Y\u016bn\u0101n\" ([[Ionia]]) and ancient Greeks \"Y\u016bn\u0101n\u012bm\" (similar to [[Hebrew]] \"Yavan\" [\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05df] for the country and \"Yevanim\" [\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd] for the people).

The people, known today as [[Byzantine Greeks]], were inhabitants of the [[Roman Empire]] and called themselves \u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af or \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 ''Rhomaioi'', [[Names of the Greeks#Romans (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9)|Romans]]. The term \"Byzantine\" is a modern designation to describe the Eastern Roman Empire, particularly after the major political restructuring of the seventh and eighth century. The [[Arab]]s, therefore, naturally called them \"the R\u00fbm\", their territory \"the land of the R\u00fbm\" and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] \"the Sea of the R\u00fbm\". They called Ancient Greece by the name \"Y\u016bn\u0101n\" ([[Ionia]]) and ancient Greeks \"Y\u016bn\u0101n\u012bm\" (similar to [[Hebrew]] \"Yavan\" [\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05df] for the country and \"Yevanim\" [\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd] for the people).

But as the Mediterranean was \"the Sea of the R\u00fbm\", so all peoples on its north coast were called sweepingly \"the R\u00fbm\".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Ottoman usage==\nAfter the [[conquest of Constantinople]], [[Mehmed II]] declared himself [[Caesar (title)#Ottoman Empire|Kayser-i Rum]], literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]\". During the 16th century, the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] used \"rume\" and \"rumes\" (plural) as a generic term to refer to the [[Mamluk]]-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces they faced then in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>Ozbaran, Salih, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6748/is_17/ai_n28127644/?tag=content;col1 \"Ottomans as 'Rumes' in Portuguese sources in the sixteenth century\"], Portuguese Studies, Annual, 2001</ref>\n\nUnder the Ottoman Empire's [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system, [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]] were in the \"Rum Millet\" (Millet-i Rum). In today's Turkey, ''Rum'' are the Turkish citizens of Greek ethnicity.

pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004

the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland

infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" />

February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]]

pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004

This would allow the attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users, or hijack shared screens. Another vulnerability allowing the client unprompted access to camera and microphone was again discovered in 2020 ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11470 CVE-2020-11470]).\n\nIn July 2019, security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh disclosed<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5 |title=Zoom Zero Day: 4+ Million Webcams & maybe an RCE?

In addition, attempts to uninstall the Zoom client on macOS would prompt the software to re-install automatically in the background, using a hidden web server that was set up on the machine during the first installation and remained active even after attempting to remove the client. After receiving public criticism, Zoom updated their software to remove the vulnerability and the hidden webserver, allowing complete uninstallation.<ref name=\"Anderson 2019\">{{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Tim | title=Anyone for unintended Chat Roulette?

The number of [[Domain name|domains]] containing the name \"Zoom\" showed a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these were used to make fake Zoom websites and links for the purposes of stealing personal information. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480806/Coronavirus-Warning-over-surge-in-Zoom-security-incidents|title=Coronavirus: Warning over surge in Zoom security incidents|last=Scroxton|first=Alex|date=30 March 2020|website=ComputerWeekly.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n====Windows credentials risk====\nOn 23 March 2020, it was discovered that because Zoom auto-converts links sent to conference participants, this becomes a vector for hackers to \"access shared network resources, such as Outlook servers and storage devices\"; i.e., hard disks, printers, shared folders, etc.<ref>{{cite news |last1=DAN GOODIN |title=Attackers can use Zoom to steal users\u2019 Windows credentials with no warning |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/unpatched-zoom-bug-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-with-no-warning/ |accessdate=2 April 2020 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=1 April 2020 |language=en |quote=The vulnerability was first described last week by a researcher who uses the Twitter handle @_g0dmode.

One of the reasons was that Zoom turned the Universal Naming Convention of the Windows network into a clickable link. If the user accidentally clicks on the relevant link, the user name and password may be leaked.\n\nSecurity experts warn that the vulnerability is serious because the required technology is scarce, and the consequences of a username and password being compromised by a hacker are unimaginable. Matthew Hickey, another expert who confirmed the vulnerabilities, claimed that hackers could use the same vulnerability to randomly cause users' computers to execute viruses and applications. Although a prompt may pop up before execution, some users may not know that pressing the confirmation randomly may make the computer poisoned or controlled by a hacker.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| symbol    = ZM\n| reuters   = ZM.O\n| bloomberg = ZM:US\n| sec_cik   = ZM\n| yahoo     = ZM\n| google    = ZM\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Software companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Jose, California]]\n[[Category:Web conferencing]]\n[[Category:Videotelephony]]\n[[Category:2019 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Zoom Video|2=Talk:Zoom Video Communications#Requested move 27 March 2020 }}\n</noinclude>{{short description|American video communications company}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name               = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| logo               = Zoom Communications Logo.svg\n| type               = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as          = {{nowrap|{{NASDAQ|ZM}} (Class A)}}\n| foundation         = 2011\n| location_city      = {{Nowrap|[[San Jose, California]]}}\n| key_people         = [[Eric Yuan]], founder and CEO\n| services           = Zoom Meetings<br>Zoom Premium Audio<br>Zoom Business IM<br>Zoom Video Webinar<br>Zoom Rooms<br>Zoom H.323/SIP Connector<br>Zoom Developer Platform\n| num_employees      = 1,958\n| num_employees_year = 2019\n| website            = {{Official URL}}\n}}\n[[File:DenverZoomAdvertizement.jpg|thumb|Zoom advertisement at [[Denver International Airport]]]]\n\n'''Zoom Video Communications''' is an American remote conferencing services company headquartered in [[San Jose, California]].

The number of [[Domain name|domains]] containing the name \"Zoom\" showed a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these were used to make fake Zoom websites and links for the purposes of stealing personal information. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480806/Coronavirus-Warning-over-surge-in-Zoom-security-incidents|title=Coronavirus: Warning over surge in Zoom security incidents|last=Scroxton|first=Alex|date=30 March 2020|website=ComputerWeekly.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Windows credentials risk===\nOn 23 March 2020, it was discovered that because Zoom auto-converts links sent to conference participants, this becomes a vector for hackers to \"access shared network resources, such as Outlook servers and storage devices\"; i.e., hard disks, printers, shared folders, etc.<ref>{{cite news |last1=DAN GOODIN |title=Attackers can use Zoom to steal users\u2019 Windows credentials with no warning |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/unpatched-zoom-bug-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-with-no-warning/ |accessdate=2 April 2020 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=1 April 2020 |language=en |quote=The vulnerability was first described last week by a researcher who uses the Twitter handle @_g0dmode.

One of the reasons was that Zoom turned the Universal Naming Convention of the Windows network into a clickable link. If the user accidentally clicks on the relevant link, the user name and password may be leaked.\n\nSecurity experts warn that the vulnerability is serious because the required technology is scarce, and the consequences of a username and password being compromised by a hacker are unimaginable. Matthew Hickey, another expert who confirmed the vulnerabilities, claimed that hackers could use the same vulnerability to randomly cause users' computers to execute viruses and applications. Although a prompt may pop up before execution, some users may not know that pressing the confirmation randomly may make the computer poisoned or controlled by a hacker.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| symbol    = ZM\n| reuters   = ZM.O\n| bloomberg = ZM:US\n| sec_cik   = ZM\n| yahoo     = ZM\n| google    = ZM\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Software companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Jose, California]]\n[[Category:Web conferencing]]\n[[Category:Videotelephony]]\n[[Category:2019 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "XavierItzm", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWindows credentials risk:typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications"}
