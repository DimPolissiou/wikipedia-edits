In 1939 the IRA tried a [[S-Plan|bombing campaign in England]] to try to force British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. From 1942\u20131944 it also mounted an ineffective [[Northern campaign (IRA)|campaign]] in Northern Ireland. [[Internment]] on both sides of the border, as well as internal feuding and disputes over future policy, all but destroyed the organisation. These campaigns were officially called off on 10 March 1945. By 1947, the IRA had only 200 activists, according to its own general staff.<ref>Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie, The Provisional IRA,Corgi 1988, {{ISBN|0-552-13337-X}} p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn principle, the IRA wished to overthrow both \"partitionist\" states in Ireland, both Northern Ireland and the [[Irish Free State]], both of which it deemed to be illegitimate entities imposed by Britain at the time of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922. However, in 1948 a General Army Convention issued General Order No. 8, prohibiting \"any armed action whatsoever\" against the forces of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|recently proclaimed]] [[Republic of Ireland]], amounting to a ''de facto'' recognition of the state. Under the new policy, IRA volunteers who were caught with arms in the Republic of Ireland were ordered to dump or destroy them and not to take defensive action.<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1979, p. 266.</ref>\n\nFrom then on, armed action was focused on Northern Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom and which was dominated by Protestant [[unionists (Ireland)|unionists]]. The idea of a campaign launched from the Republic against Northern Ireland, first mooted by [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in the 1930s, gained currency within IRA circles as the 1950s went on.<ref>Bowyer Bell, p. 246.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | doi =  | isbn = 0-330-49388-4 | page = 71}}</ref><ref name=\"em\">{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 2002 | pages = 49\u201350 | isbn = 0-14-101041-X}}</ref> In 1954, after an arms raid at [[Gough Barracks]] in [[Armagh]], a speaker at the [[Wolfe Tone]] commemoration at [[Bodenstown]] repeated that IRA policy was directed solely against British forces in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat | authorlink = Tim Pat Coogan | title = The IRA | publisher = Fontana Books |year= 1987 | doi =  | isbn = 0-00-636943-X | page = 266}}</ref>\n\nIRA Chief of Staff [[Tony Magan]] set out to create \"a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade,\" according to [[J. Bowyer Bell]].<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1979, p. 246</ref> One of its advisers was a retired British Major-General, [[Eric Dorman-Smith]]. The IRA was officially \"apolitical,\" existing only to overthrow the \"British-imposed political institutions\" in Ireland. However Magan believed that a degree of political mobilization was necessary and the relationship with [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] which had soured during the 30s was improved.<ref>''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, {{ISBN|1-84488-120-2}}, pp. 3</ref> At the 1949 IRA Convention, the IRA ordered its members to join Sinn F\u00e9in, which would partially become the \"civilian wing\" of the IRA.<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 247\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Re-arming==\nBy the middle of this decade, moreover, the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. Arms were taken from [[Derry]], [[Omagh]], [[Essex]], [[Berkshire]] and [[Armagh]]. At the latter raid on Gough barracks in Armagh in June 1954, the IRA seized 250 [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, 37 [[submachine gun]]s, nine [[Bren gun]]s and 40 training rifles. On 25 July 1953, there was an IRA arms raid on the armoury of the Officer Training Corps at Felsted, a private school in Essex. In that raid, the IRA netted over 108 rifles, ten Bren and eight [[Sten]] guns, two mortars and dummy mortar bombs. The police seized the van carrying the stolen weapons some hours later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/the-way-we-were-no-pomp-or-ceremony-as-keys-for-gough-barracks-are-handed-back-1-5781470|title=THE WAY WE WERE: No pomp or ceremony as keys for Gough Barracks are handed back|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1955, splits were occurring in the IRA, as several small groups, impatient for action, launched their own attacks in Northern Ireland. One such activist, [[Brendan O'Boyle]] blew himself up with his own bomb in the summer of that year. Another, [[Liam Kelly (Irish republican)|Liam Kelly]] founded a breakaway group [[Saor Uladh]] (\"Free Ulster\") and in November 1955, attacked a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) barracks at [[Roslea]] in [[County Fermanagh]]. One RUC man was badly injured and a Republican fighter was killed in the incident. In August of the following year, Kelly and another IRA dissident, [[Joe Christle]], burned down some customs posts on the border.\n\nIn November 1956, the IRA finally began its own border campaign. They were partly motivated by a desire to prevent any more splits in their organisation. They were also encouraged by the results of the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|UK general election of 1955]], when [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (since 1949, largely dominated by IRA members) candidates were elected MPs for the [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] and [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] constituencies in Northern Ireland, with a total of 152,310 votes. This appeared to show that there was a substantial [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] support base within Northern Ireland. However, as the mainstream [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] had decided not to take part in the election, its supporters had voted for Sinn F\u00e9in instead.<ref>MLR Smith. \"Fighting for Ireland?\" Routledge 1995 p.67. {{ISBN|0-415-09161-6}}</ref>\n\n==Planning the campaign==\nThe plan for the border campaign \u2013 codenamed \"Operation Harvest\" \u2013 was devised by [[Se\u00e1n Cronin]]. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called [[flying column]]s, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA document probably seized in Dublin in a raid on Cronin's flat, on 8 January 1957, stated that the aim of the campaign was to:\n\"break down the enemy\u2019s  administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces. Our method of doing this is guerrilla warfare within the occupied area and propaganda directed at its inhabitants. In time as we build up our forces, we hope to be in a position to liberate large areas and tie these in with other liberated areas \u2013 that is areas where the enemy\u2019s writ no longer runs\".<ref>The document seized at Cronin's was titled, \"General Directive for Guerrilla Campaign. Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 300\u2013301; Bishop, Mallie, the Provisional IRA, page41</ref>\n\nNo actions were to take place in [[Belfast]], the capital and biggest city in Northern Ireland. It was excluded because Paddy Doyle, the Belfast operational commander and a member of the Army Council, was arrested and the unit was disorganized,<ref>Bell, The Secret Army, p. 285 and note 17, p. 287-88.</ref> although Hanley and Millar attribute the non-participation of the Belfast IRA to fears that informers had access to the IRA's plans.<ref>Hanley and Miller, ''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', p.15</ref> There was also a desire not to provoke reprisals by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] against the Catholic/nationalist population there. This had happened on a large scale in 1920\u201322, during and after the [[Irish War of Independence]].\n\n==The campaign==\n\n===1956===\nOn 12 December the campaign was launched with simultaneous attacks by around 150 IRA members on targets on the Border in the early hours.<ref>Hanley and Miller, ''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', p.14</ref> A [[BBC]] relay transmitter was bombed in Derry, a courthouse was burned in [[Magherafelt]] by a unit led by an 18-year-old [[Seamus Costello]],<ref>Hanley and Miller, p.14</ref> as was a [[B-Specials]] post near [[Newry]] and a half-built Army barracks at [[Enniskillen]] was blown up. A raid on Gough barracks in Armagh was beaten off after a brief exchange of fire.\n\nThe IRA issued a statement announcing the start of the campaign, \"Spearheaded by Ireland\u2019s freedom fighters, our people have carried the fight to the enemy\u2026Out of this national liberation struggle a new Ireland will emerge, upright and free. In that new Ireland, we shall build a country fit for all our people to live in. That then is our aim: an independent, united, democratic Irish Republic. For this we shall fight until the invader is driven from our soil and victory is ours\".<ref>Bishop, Mallie, page 41</ref> Despite formal condemnation of the IRA by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] hierarchy, many units were given absolution before going out on operation.<ref>Hanley and Miller, pp.14\u201315</ref>\nOn 14 December: An IRA column under [[Se\u00e1n Garland]] detonated four bombs (one of which blew in the front wall) outside [[Lisnaskea]] RUC station before raking it with gunfire. Further attacks on [[Derrylin]] and [[Roslea]] RUC barracks on the same day were beaten off.\nOn 21 December: In response to the statement the government of Northern Ireland under [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Basil Brooke]] used the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] to intern several hundred republican suspects without trial. Over 100 men were arrested on 12 January 1957.<ref>Hanley and Millar, p.15</ref> This, in time, severely limited the IRA's capacity to build up units within Northern Ireland.\nOn the evening of December 30, the [[Teeling Column]] under Noel Kavanagh attacked the Derrylin RUC barracks again, killing RUC constable John Scally, the first fatality of the campaign.  Others involved in that attack included two prominent IRA men, Charlie Murphy and [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]].<ref>Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===1957===\n\nThe year 1957 was the most active year of the IRA's campaign, with 341 incidents recorded.<ref name=\"Hanley, Millar, p.17\">Hanley, Millar, p.17</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic attack of the whole campaign took place on 1 January: 14 IRA volunteers, including S\u00e9an Garland, Alan O Brien and [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]]  planned an attack on a joint RUC/B Specials barracks in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, though they attacked the wrong building. During the attack a number of volunteers were injured including S\u00e9an Garland. [[Fergal O'Hanlon]] and [[Se\u00e1n South]] died of their wounds as they were making their escape. The remainder of the group were pursued back over the border by 400 RUC, [[B Specials]] and British soldiers.<ref>[[J. Bowyer Bell]], The Secret Army, p. 299.</ref>\nThe funerals of South and O\u2019Hanlon in the Republic produced a strong emotional reaction among the general public there. The two men are still considered martyrs in Irish Republican circles.<ref>Richard English Armed Struggle, 'two newly minted martyrs killed in the assault and subsequently celebrated in balladry and romantic imagination '  p.74</ref> Up to 50,000 people attended their funerals.<ref>Bishop, Mallie, Provisional IRA, p.43</ref>\n\n[[File:Edentubber-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque to the Edentubber Martyrs, killed in November 1957]]\n\nShortly afterwards the Republic's government, led by John Costello of Fine Gael, feared that the IRA's action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain. It used the Offences Against the State Act to arrest most of the IRA's leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Cronin. Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]]) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn F\u00e9in won four seats and polled 65,640 votes (c. 5% of those cast), while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. However, Clann na Poblachta were very weak originally in the constituencies where Sinn F\u00e9in fielded candidates.\n\nThe new government, of Fianna F\u00e1il, led by \u00c9amon de Valera proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.\n\nOn 11 November: The IRA suffered its worst loss of life in the period when four of its members died preparing a bomb in a farm house at [[Edentubber]], [[County Louth]], which exploded prematurely. The civilian owner of the house was also killed.<ref>English, Armed Struggle, p74</ref> It is believed they were going to attack an empty customs post and electricity pylons in Northern Ireland. They would later be referred to by republicans as the \"[[Edentubber martyrs|Edentubber Martyrs]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/memorial-for-ira-bombers-splits-opinion-in-enniscorthy-1.633276|title=Memorial for IRA bombers splits opinion in Enniscorthy|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===1958 -1960 ===\nBy 1958, the campaign's initial impetus had largely dissipated. Certain IRA activities produced public hostility and by 1958, there were already many within the IRA in favour of calling the campaign off. The Cork IRA, for instance, had effectively withdrawn.<ref name=\"Hanley, Millar, p.17\"/> By mid-1958, 500 republicans were in gaol or interned, North and South. The decline in activity meant that the Fianna F\u00e1il government in the South felt confident enough to end internment in March 1959.<ref>Hanley, Millar, p.17-18</ref> Following their release, some of the interned leaders met Sean Cronin in a farmhouse in [[County Laois]] and were persuaded to continue the campaign \"to keep the flame alive\".<ref>Hanley, Millar, p.18</ref> In 1960, the number of incidents fell to just 26. Moreover, many of these actions consisted of minor acts of sabotage, for example the cratering of roads.<ref>Mallie, Bishop, p45</ref>\n\nThat summer two IRA men were killed in separate gun battles with the RUC on the border in County Fermanagh, Aloysius Hand in July and James Crossan in August.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K-XsIheKNYIC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76|title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA|first=Richard|last=English|publisher=Pan Macmillan|date=|page=76|ISBN=9780330475785}}</ref>\n\nThe period after the summer of 1958 saw a steep drop in the intensity of the IRA campaign. That the IRA's campaign had run its course by 1960 is testified by the fact that the Republic of Ireland's government closed the Curragh camp, which housed internees in the South, on 15 March 1959 (judging them to be no further threat).<ref>J.B. Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 325\u201326.</ref>  The Northern Irish government followed suit on 25 April 1961.\n\n===1961===\n\nIn November 1961 An RUC officer, William Hunter, was killed in a gun battle with the IRA in south [[County Armagh]]. This was the final fatality of the conflict. Minister for Justice, [[Charles Haughey]] reactivated the [[Special Criminal Court]], which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men.\n\n==End of the campaign==\n\nBy late 1961, the campaign was over. It had cost the lives of eight IRA men, four republican supporters and six RUC members.  In addition, 32 RUC members were wounded. A total of 256 Republicans were interned in Northern Ireland in this period and another 150 or so in the Republic. Of those in Northern Ireland, 89 had signed a pledge to renounce violence in return for their freedom.\n\nAlthough it had petered out by the late 1950s, the campaign was officially called off on 26 February 1962. In a [[press release]] issued that day, drafted by [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] who consulted with several other persons including members of the Army Council, the [[IRA Army Council]] stated:\n\n{{Cquote|The leadership of the Resistance Movement has ordered the termination of the Campaign of Resistance to British occupation launched on 12 December 1956. Instructions issued to Volunteers of the Active Service Units and of local Units in the occupied area have now been carried out. All arms and other mat\u00e9riel have been dumped and all full-time active service volunteers have been withdrawn... Foremost among the factors motivating this course of action has been the attitude of the general public whose minds have been deliberately distracted from the supreme issue facing the Irish people \u2013 the unity and freedom of Ireland. The Irish resistance movement renews its pledge of eternal hostility to the British Forces of Occupation in Ireland. It calls on the Irish people for increased support and looks forward with confidence \u2013 in co-operation with the other branches of the Republican Movement \u2013 to a period of consolidation, expansion and preparation for the final and victorious phase of the struggle for the full freedom of Ireland.}}\n\nThe statement was released by the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau and signed \"J. McGarrity, Secretary.\"<ref>The United Irishman, March 1962, p. 1; see also Bishop, Mallie, page 45, M.E. Collins, Ireland 1968-1966, page 464, Richard English, Armed Struggle page 75.</ref>\n\nImplicit in the statement was a recognition that the IRA, after a promising start in 1957, had failed to mobilise much popular support behind its campaign.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In 2007 the campaign was the subject of a [[TG4]] documentary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=74982|title=Irish Film & TV Research Online - Trinity College Dublin|website=www.tcd.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\nThe border campaign was considered a disaster by some IRA members, not least because it enjoyed practically no support from the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] population of Northern Ireland.  Even before the campaign ended some within the organisation had begun to consider other avenues in pursuit of the organisation's goals. Many of those involved with the border campaign felt that their lack of support was due to a failure to address the social and economic issues faced by ordinary people.  The early seeds of addressing such issues are found in Sinn F\u00e9in election materials in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe larger [[Unionism in Ireland#Northern Ireland|unionist]] population in Northern Ireland was further alienated from Irish republicanism by the campaign, and considered that its internment policy had worked. However, the policy was to fail when it was repeated in the 1970s.\n\n[[Cathal Goulding]], who became IRA Chief of Staff in 1962, tried to move the IRA away from pure militarism and towards left wing and ultimately [[Marxist]] politics. This process ended with the 1969/70 split in the republican movement between the [[Official IRA]] and [[Provisional IRA]] wings. The Officials, under Goulding wanted to transform the movement into a revolutionary party involved in both parliamentary and street politics, while the Provisionals under [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]], wanted to maintain the movement's traditional refusal to engage in parliamentary politics. More immediately, the Provisional faction wanted to use armed force to defend the Catholic community in Belfast from loyalist attacks in the civil strife that had broken out in Northern Ireland (the start of \"[[The Troubles]]\"), but the [[Official IRA]], as led by Goulding, also engaged as Belfast defenders.  A key difference is that, ultimately, the Provisionals also wanted to re-build the IRA's military capacity to launch a new armed campaign.<ref>J.

In 1939 the IRA tried a [[S-Plan|bombing campaign in England]] to try to force British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. From 1942\u20131944 it also mounted an ineffective [[Northern campaign (IRA)|campaign]] in Northern Ireland. [[Internment]] on both sides of the border, as well as internal feuding and disputes over future policy, all but destroyed the organisation. These campaigns were officially called off on 10 March 1945. By 1947, the IRA had only 200 activists, according to its own general staff.<ref>Patrick Bishop, Eamonn Mallie, The Provisional IRA,Corgi 1988, {{ISBN|0-552-13337-X}} p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn principle, the IRA wished to overthrow both \"partitionist\" states in Ireland, both Northern Ireland and the [[Irish Free State]], both of which it deemed to be illegitimate entities imposed by Britain at the time of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922. However, in 1948 a General Army Convention issued General Order No. 8, prohibiting \"any armed action whatsoever\" against the forces of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|recently proclaimed]] [[Republic of Ireland]], amounting to a ''de facto'' recognition of the state. Under the new policy, IRA volunteers who were caught with arms in the Republic of Ireland were ordered to dump or destroy them and not to take defensive action.<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1979, p. 266.</ref>\n\nFrom then on, armed action was focused on Northern Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom and which was dominated by Protestant [[unionists (Ireland)|unionists]]. The idea of a campaign launched from the Republic against Northern Ireland, first mooted by [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in the 1930s, gained currency within IRA circles as the 1950s went on.<ref>Bowyer Bell, p. 246.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | doi =  | isbn = 0-330-49388-4 | page = 71}}</ref><ref name=\"em\">{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 2002 | pages = 49\u201350 | isbn = 0-14-101041-X}}</ref> In 1954, after an arms raid at [[Gough Barracks]] in [[Armagh]], a speaker at the [[Wolfe Tone]] commemoration at [[Bodenstown]] repeated that IRA policy was directed solely against British forces in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat | authorlink = Tim Pat Coogan | title = The IRA | publisher = Fontana Books |year= 1987 | doi =  | isbn = 0-00-636943-X | page = 266}}</ref>\n\nIRA Chief of Staff [[Tony Magan]] set out to create \"a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade,\" according to [[J. Bowyer Bell]].<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, 1979, p. 246</ref> One of its advisers was a retired British Major-General, [[Eric Dorman-Smith]]. The IRA was officially \"apolitical,\" existing only to overthrow the \"British-imposed political institutions\" in Ireland. However Magan believed that a degree of political mobilization was necessary and the relationship with [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] which had soured during the 30s was improved.<ref>''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, {{ISBN|1-84488-120-2}}, pp. 3</ref> At the 1949 IRA Convention, the IRA ordered its members to join Sinn F\u00e9in, which would partially become the \"civilian wing\" of the IRA.<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 247\u201348.</ref>\n\n==Re-arming==\nBy the middle of this decade, moreover, the IRA had substantially re-armed. This was achieved by means of arms raids launched between 1951 and 1954, on British military bases in Northern Ireland and England. Arms were taken from [[Derry]], [[Omagh]], [[Essex]], [[Berkshire]] and [[Armagh]]. At the latter raid on Gough barracks in Armagh in June 1954, the IRA seized 250 [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, 37 [[submachine gun]]s, nine [[Bren gun]]s and 40 training rifles. On 25 July 1953, there was an IRA arms raid on the armoury of the Officer Training Corps at Felsted, a private school in Essex. In that raid, the IRA netted over 108 rifles, ten Bren and eight [[Sten]] guns, two mortars and dummy mortar bombs. The police seized the van carrying the stolen weapons some hours later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/the-way-we-were-no-pomp-or-ceremony-as-keys-for-gough-barracks-are-handed-back-1-5781470|title=THE WAY WE WERE: No pomp or ceremony as keys for Gough Barracks are handed back|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1955, splits were occurring in the IRA, as several small groups, impatient for action, launched their own attacks in Northern Ireland. One such activist, [[Brendan O'Boyle]] blew himself up with his own bomb in the summer of that year. Another, [[Liam Kelly (Irish republican)|Liam Kelly]] founded a breakaway group [[Saor Uladh]] (\"Free Ulster\") and in November 1955, attacked a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) barracks at [[Roslea]] in [[County Fermanagh]]. One RUC man was badly injured and a Republican fighter was killed in the incident. In August of the following year, Kelly and another IRA dissident, [[Joe Christle]], burned down some customs posts on the border.\n\nIn November 1956, the IRA finally began its own border campaign. They were partly motivated by a desire to prevent any more splits in their organisation. They were also encouraged by the results of the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|UK general election of 1955]], when [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (since 1949, largely dominated by IRA members) candidates were elected MPs for the [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Ulster]] and [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] constituencies in Northern Ireland, with a total of 152,310 votes. This appeared to show that there was a substantial [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] support base within Northern Ireland. However, as the mainstream [[Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] had decided not to take part in the election, its supporters had voted for Sinn F\u00e9in instead.<ref>MLR Smith. \"Fighting for Ireland?\" Routledge 1995 p.67. {{ISBN|0-415-09161-6}}</ref>\n\n==Planning the campaign==\nThe plan for the border campaign \u2013 codenamed \"Operation Harvest\" \u2013 was devised by [[Se\u00e1n Cronin]]. It envisaged the use of guerrilla units called [[flying column]]s, initially four units of about 50 men each. They were to operate from within the Republic of Ireland and to attack military and infrastructural targets within Northern Ireland. In addition, another twenty organisers were sent to various locations within Northern Ireland to train new units, gather intelligence and report back to the leadership in Dublin. An IRA document probably seized in Dublin in a raid on Cronin's flat, on 8 January 1957, stated that the aim of the campaign was to:\n\"break down the enemy\u2019s  administration in the occupied area until he is forced to withdraw his forces. Our method of doing this is guerrilla warfare within the occupied area and propaganda directed at its inhabitants. In time as we build up our forces, we hope to be in a position to liberate large areas and tie these in with other liberated areas \u2013 that is areas where the enemy\u2019s writ no longer runs\".<ref>The document seized at Cronin's was titled, \"General Directive for Guerrilla Campaign. Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 300\u2013301; Bishop, Mallie, the Provisional IRA, page41</ref>\n\nNo actions were to take place in [[Belfast]], the capital and biggest city in Northern Ireland. It was excluded because Paddy Doyle, the Belfast operational commander and a member of the Army Council, was arrested and the unit was disorganized,<ref>Bell, The Secret Army, p. 285 and note 17, p. 287-88.</ref> although Hanley and Millar attribute the non-participation of the Belfast IRA to fears that informers had access to the IRA's plans.<ref>Hanley and Miller, ''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', p.15</ref> There was also a desire not to provoke reprisals by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] against the Catholic/nationalist population there. This had happened on a large scale in 1920\u201322, during and after the [[Irish War of Independence]].\n\n==The campaign==\n\n===1956===\nOn 12 December the campaign was launched with simultaneous attacks by around 150 IRA members on targets on the Border in the early hours.<ref>Hanley and Miller, ''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party'', p.14</ref> A [[BBC]] relay transmitter was bombed in Derry, a courthouse was burned in [[Magherafelt]] by a unit led by an 18-year-old [[Seamus Costello]],<ref>Hanley and Miller, p.14</ref> as was a [[B-Specials]] post near [[Newry]] and a half-built Army barracks at [[Enniskillen]] was blown up. A raid on Gough barracks in Armagh was beaten off after a brief exchange of fire.\n\nThe IRA issued a statement announcing the start of the campaign, \"Spearheaded by Ireland\u2019s freedom fighters, our people have carried the fight to the enemy\u2026Out of this national liberation struggle a new Ireland will emerge, upright and free. In that new Ireland, we shall build a country fit for all our people to live in. That then is our aim: an independent, united, democratic Irish Republic. For this we shall fight until the invader is driven from our soil and victory is ours\".<ref>Bishop, Mallie, page 41</ref> Despite formal condemnation of the IRA by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] hierarchy, many units were given absolution before going out on operation.<ref>Hanley and Miller, pp.14\u201315</ref>\nOn 14 December: An IRA column under [[Se\u00e1n Garland]] detonated four bombs (one of which blew in the front wall) outside [[Lisnaskea]] RUC station before raking it with gunfire. Further attacks on [[Derrylin]] and [[Roslea]] RUC barracks on the same day were beaten off.\nOn 21 December: In response to the statement the government of Northern Ireland under [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Basil Brooke]] used the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] to intern several hundred republican suspects without trial. Over 100 men were arrested on 12 January 1957.<ref>Hanley and Millar, p.15</ref> This, in time, severely limited the IRA's capacity to build up units within Northern Ireland.\nOn the evening of December 30, the [[Teeling Column]] under Noel Kavanagh attacked the Derrylin RUC barracks again, killing RUC constable John Scally, the first fatality of the campaign.  Others involved in that attack included two prominent IRA men, Charlie Murphy and [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]].<ref>Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===1957===\n\nThe year 1957 was the most active year of the IRA's campaign, with 341 incidents recorded.<ref name=\"Hanley, Millar, p.17\">Hanley, Millar, p.17</ref>\n\nThe most dramatic attack of the whole campaign took place on 1 January: 14 IRA volunteers, including S\u00e9an Garland , Alan O Brien and [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]]  planned an attack on a joint RUC/B Specials barracks in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, though they attacked the wrong building. During the attack a number of volunteers were injured including S\u00e9an Garland. [[Fergal O'Hanlon]] and [[Se\u00e1n South]] died of their wounds as they were making their escape. The remainder of the group were pursued back over the border by 400 RUC, [[B Specials]] and British soldiers.<ref>[[J. Bowyer Bell]], The Secret Army, p. 299.</ref>\nThe funerals of South and O\u2019Hanlon in the Republic produced a strong emotional reaction among the general public there. The two men are still considered martyrs in Irish Republican circles.<ref>Richard English Armed Struggle, 'two newly minted martyrs killed in the assault and subsequently celebrated in balladry and romantic imagination '  p.74</ref> Up to 50,000 people attended their funerals.<ref>Bishop, Mallie, Provisional IRA, p.43</ref>\n\n[[File:Edentubber-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque to the Edentubber Martyrs, killed in November 1957]]\n\nShortly afterwards the Republic's government, led by John Costello of Fine Gael, feared that the IRA's action would drag it into a diplomatic confrontation with Britain. It used the Offences Against the State Act to arrest most of the IRA's leadership, including its Chief of Staff, Se\u00e1n Cronin. Clann na Poblachta (led by former IRA Chief of Staff [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]]) withdrew its support for the government in protest over this policy. In the ensuing Irish general election, 1957, Sinn F\u00e9in won four seats and polled 65,640 votes (c. 5% of those cast), while Clann na Poblachta's vote dropped sharply. However, Clann na Poblachta were very weak originally in the constituencies where Sinn F\u00e9in fielded candidates.\n\nThe new government, of Fianna F\u00e1il, led by \u00c9amon de Valera proved even more hostile to the IRA than its predecessor. In July 1957, after the killing of an RUC man, de Valera introduced wholesale internment without trial for IRA suspects. The use of internment on both sides of the Irish border made it impossible for the IRA, most of whose leadership was imprisoned, to maintain the momentum of their campaign.\n\nOn 11 November: The IRA suffered its worst loss of life in the period when four of its members died preparing a bomb in a farm house at [[Edentubber]], [[County Louth]], which exploded prematurely. The civilian owner of the house was also killed.<ref>English, Armed Struggle, p74</ref> It is believed they were going to attack an empty customs post and electricity pylons in Northern Ireland. They would later be referred to by republicans as the \"[[Edentubber martyrs|Edentubber Martyrs]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/memorial-for-ira-bombers-splits-opinion-in-enniscorthy-1.633276|title=Memorial for IRA bombers splits opinion in Enniscorthy|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===1958 -1960 ===\nBy 1958, the campaign's initial impetus had largely dissipated. Certain IRA activities produced public hostility and by 1958, there were already many within the IRA in favour of calling the campaign off. The Cork IRA, for instance, had effectively withdrawn.<ref name=\"Hanley, Millar, p.17\"/> By mid-1958, 500 republicans were in gaol or interned, North and South. The decline in activity meant that the Fianna F\u00e1il government in the South felt confident enough to end internment in March 1959.<ref>Hanley, Millar, p.17-18</ref> Following their release, some of the interned leaders met Sean Cronin in a farmhouse in [[County Laois]] and were persuaded to continue the campaign \"to keep the flame alive\".<ref>Hanley, Millar, p.18</ref> In 1960, the number of incidents fell to just 26. Moreover, many of these actions consisted of minor acts of sabotage, for example the cratering of roads.<ref>Mallie, Bishop, p45</ref>\n\nThat summer two IRA men were killed in separate gun battles with the RUC on the border in County Fermanagh, Aloysius Hand in July and James Crossan in August.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K-XsIheKNYIC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76|title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA|first=Richard|last=English|publisher=Pan Macmillan|date=|page=76|ISBN=9780330475785}}</ref>\n\nThe period after the summer of 1958 saw a steep drop in the intensity of the IRA campaign. That the IRA's campaign had run its course by 1960 is testified by the fact that the Republic of Ireland's government closed the Curragh camp, which housed internees in the South, on 15 March 1959 (judging them to be no further threat).<ref>J.B. Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 325\u201326.</ref>  The Northern Irish government followed suit on 25 April 1961.\n\n===1961===\n\nIn November 1961 An RUC officer, William Hunter, was killed in a gun battle with the IRA in south [[County Armagh]]. This was the final fatality of the conflict. Minister for Justice, [[Charles Haughey]] reactivated the [[Special Criminal Court]], which handed down long prison sentences to convicted IRA men.\n\n==End of the campaign==\n\nBy late 1961, the campaign was over. It had cost the lives of eight IRA men, four republican supporters and six RUC members.  In addition, 32 RUC members were wounded. A total of 256 Republicans were interned in Northern Ireland in this period and another 150 or so in the Republic. Of those in Northern Ireland, 89 had signed a pledge to renounce violence in return for their freedom.\n\nAlthough it had petered out by the late 1950s, the campaign was officially called off on 26 February 1962. In a [[press release]] issued that day, drafted by [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]] who consulted with several other persons including members of the Army Council, the [[IRA Army Council]] stated:\n\n{{Cquote|The leadership of the Resistance Movement has ordered the termination of the Campaign of Resistance to British occupation launched on 12 December 1956. Instructions issued to Volunteers of the Active Service Units and of local Units in the occupied area have now been carried out. All arms and other mat\u00e9riel have been dumped and all full-time active service volunteers have been withdrawn... Foremost among the factors motivating this course of action has been the attitude of the general public whose minds have been deliberately distracted from the supreme issue facing the Irish people \u2013 the unity and freedom of Ireland. The Irish resistance movement renews its pledge of eternal hostility to the British Forces of Occupation in Ireland. It calls on the Irish people for increased support and looks forward with confidence \u2013 in co-operation with the other branches of the Republican Movement \u2013 to a period of consolidation, expansion and preparation for the final and victorious phase of the struggle for the full freedom of Ireland.}}\n\nThe statement was released by the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau and signed \"J. McGarrity, Secretary.\"<ref>The United Irishman, March 1962, p. 1; see also Bishop, Mallie, page 45, M.E. Collins, Ireland 1968-1966, page 464, Richard English, Armed Struggle page 75.</ref>\n\nImplicit in the statement was a recognition that the IRA, after a promising start in 1957, had failed to mobilise much popular support behind its campaign.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In 2007 the campaign was the subject of a [[TG4]] documentary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/irishfilm/showfilm.php?fid=74982|title=Irish Film & TV Research Online - Trinity College Dublin|website=www.tcd.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\nThe border campaign was considered a disaster by some IRA members, not least because it enjoyed practically no support from the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] population of Northern Ireland.  Even before the campaign ended some within the organisation had begun to consider other avenues in pursuit of the organisation's goals. Many of those involved with the border campaign felt that their lack of support was due to a failure to address the social and economic issues faced by ordinary people.  The early seeds of addressing such issues are found in Sinn F\u00e9in election materials in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe larger [[Unionism in Ireland#Northern Ireland|unionist]] population in Northern Ireland was further alienated from Irish republicanism by the campaign, and considered that its internment policy had worked. However, the policy was to fail when it was repeated in the 1970s.\n\n[[Cathal Goulding]], who became IRA Chief of Staff in 1962, tried to move the IRA away from pure militarism and towards left wing and ultimately [[Marxist]] politics. This process ended with the 1969/70 split in the republican movement between the [[Official IRA]] and [[Provisional IRA]] wings. The Officials, under Goulding wanted to transform the movement into a revolutionary party involved in both parliamentary and street politics, while the Provisionals under [[Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh]], wanted to maintain the movement's traditional refusal to engage in parliamentary politics. More immediately, the Provisional faction wanted to use armed force to defend the Catholic community in Belfast from loyalist attacks in the civil strife that had broken out in Northern Ireland (the start of \"[[The Troubles]]\"), but the [[Official IRA]], as led by Goulding, also engaged as Belfast defenders.  A key difference is that, ultimately, the Provisionals also wanted to re-build the IRA's military capacity to launch a new armed campaign.<ref>J.

The scout also noted that this was his first year playing baseball and he seemed to be a \"do it all type of player\" and also stated he was \"the best pure athlete in America today\".

Jackson, who ran 17 times for 114 yards during this Iron Bowl, continued marching his team downfield as he caught an 8-yard pass from quarterback Randy Campbell down to the Alabama 1-yard line. During the huddle Bo convinced Coach Dye to let him go over the top of offensive and defensive lines because he was a 7 foot high jumper in high school and the other team wouldn't be expecting it.

The main entrance was on the [[National Road]] {{convert|4|mi}} west of [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio]]. Boundaries of the camp were present-day Broad Street (north), Hague Avenue (east), Sullivant Avenue (south), and near Westgate Avenue (west). Named for former Ohio Governor, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who was [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] [[Secretary of the Treasury]]; it was a training camp for Ohio volunteer army soldiers, a parole camp, a [[muster (military)|muster]] outpost, and later a prisoner-of-war camp. The nearby [[Camp Thomas (Ohio)|Camp Thomas]] served as a similar base for the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. As many as 150,000 Union soldiers and 25,000 Confederate prisoners passed through its gates from 1861\u20131865. By February 1865, over 9,400 men were held at the prison. More than 2,200 Confederates are buried in the Camp Chase Cemetery. [[West Virginia|Western Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] civilians suspected of actively supporting [[secession]], including former three-term [[United States Congressman]] [[Richard Henry Stanton]] were held at the facility.<ref name=\":0\" /> The prison camp also held Confederates captured during [[Morgan's Raid]] in 1863, including Col. [[Basil W. Duke]].\n\nThe camp was closed in 1865, and by September 1867, dismantled buildings, usable items, and 450 patients from Tripler Military Hospital (also in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]) were transferred to the National Soldier's Home in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. In 1895, former Union soldier William H. Knauss organized the first memorial service at the cemetery. In 1906 he published a history of the camp.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The story of Camp Chase; a history of the prison and its cemetery, together with other cemeteries where Confederate prisoners are buried, etc.|last=Knauss|first=William H.

The legend of the Lady in Gray dates back to just after the Civil War, when visitors to Camp Chase spotted the woman walking through the cemetery, trying to read the carved names on the marked grave markers.

Camp Chase is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n== History ==\nCamp Chase was an [[American Civil War]] training and prison camp established in May 1861, on land leased by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]].<ref name=\":0\" /> It replaced the much smaller Camp Jackson which was established by Ohio Governor [[William Dennison Jr.|William Dennison Jr]] as a place for Ohio's union volunteers to meet.<ref name=\":0\" /> It originally operated from a city park. The main entrance was on the [[National Road]] {{convert|4|mi}} west of [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio]]. Boundaries of the camp were present-day Broad Street (north), Hague Avenue (east), Sullivant Avenue (south), and near Westgate Avenue (west). Named for former Ohio Governor, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who was [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] [[Secretary of the Treasury]]; it was a training camp for Ohio volunteer army soldiers, a parole camp, a [[muster (military)|muster]] outpost, and later a prisoner-of-war camp. The nearby [[Camp Thomas (Ohio)|Camp Thomas]] served as a similar base for the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. As many as 150,000 Union soldiers and 25,000 Confederate prisoners passed through its gates from 1861\u20131865. By February 1865, over 9,400 men were held at the prison. More than 2,200 Confederates are buried in the Camp Chase Cemetery. [[West Virginia|Western Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] civilians suspected of actively supporting [[secession]], including former three-term [[United States Congressman]] [[Richard Henry Stanton]] were held at the facility.<ref name=\":0\" /> The prison camp also held Confederates captured during [[Morgan's Raid]] in 1863, including Col. [[Basil W. Duke]].\n\nThe camp was closed in 1865, and by September 1867, dismantled buildings, usable items, and 450 patients from Tripler Military Hospital (also in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]) were transferred to the National Soldier's Home in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. In 1895, former Union soldier William H. Knauss organized the first memorial service at the cemetery. In 1906 he published a history of the camp.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The story of Camp Chase; a history of the prison and its cemetery, together with other cemeteries where Confederate prisoners are buried, etc.|last=Knauss|first=William H.

From 1912 to 1994, the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] held annual services to commemorate Confederate soldiers who had been held and died there. The Hilltop Historical Society now sponsors the event on the second Sunday in June.\n\n== Prison conditions ==\nThe living conditions at Camp Chase were inadequate for a number of reasons. The prisoners were never intentionally starved, but because the [[Union Army|Union army]] focused on feeding its own soldiers first it often left the prisoners with little to no food.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Terrors and horrors of prison life.|last=Hiram.|first=Duff, William|date=2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=978-1175863638|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=945209262}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Captives in gray : the Civil War prisons of the Union|last=Roger|first=Pickenpaugh|isbn=9780817316525|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|oclc=263408664|date = May 24, 2009}}</ref> The largest number of soldiers and officers held at Camp chase at a single time was in 1863 when the prison camp held around 8,000 men.<ref name=\":1\" /> Because of the large number of prisoners crowded in a relatively small area, there was also a large outbreak of [[smallpox]] and other deadly diseases. This resulted in the death of hundreds of prisoners in the winter of 1863-1864.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camps had the same conditions on both sides of the war. Because of this, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] agreed to exchange prisoners to stop the suffering of men on both sides. Ultimately around 10,000 soldiers were exchanged between both sides.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Camp Chase and the evolution of Union prison policy|last=Roger.|first=Pickenpaugh|date=2007|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=9780817380359|location=Tuscaloosa|oclc=183296792}}</ref>\n\n== The Lady in Gray ==\nThe Lady in Gray is purportedly an apparition that haunts Camp Chase Cemetery. The story goes that the ghost is looking for her lost love, and cannot find him in the cemetery. The woman is described as young, in her late teens or early twenties, dressed entirely in gray, and carrying a clean white handkerchief. The legend of the Lady in Gray dates back to just after the Civil War, when visitors to Camp Chase spotted the woman walking through the cemetery, trying to read the carved names on the marked grave markers. She was seen quite often for several years, before disappearing completely.<ref>[http://www.themashburncollection.com/2011/04/grey-lady-ghost-and-jackson-m-holmes.html \"The Mashburn Collection: The Grey Lady Ghost\"], April 2011.

Pol.Col.Chumpon Attasat Superintendent  of the Riot Control and Suppression Sub-Division had established a special operation unit called \"Anti-Hijacker\". He has selected police officers within the unit who were physically, mentally and intellectually ready to the specified qualifications to attend the training in order to cater for missions of the international nature. During the training,  there was no financial support not even for the meals of the attendees. Therefore, participants joined in this training with their hearts and ideologies. After Pol.Col.Chumpon Attasit was assigned to take a position in a different unit the special operation had changed. \n\nIn 1983 There was an international terrorism incident and insurgency in Thailand particularly in Bangkok. Pol.Maj.General Thip Asawarak Commander of Patrol and Special Operations Division at that time had resurrected the special operation unit. He requested the Royal Thai Police department for the authorization of an international training plan for the special operation unit similar to GSG9 in Germany. Later in 1984, The Royal Thai Police department ordered the establishment  of a special operation unit within the Metropolitan Police Bureau, using the name of special operation unit  \"Arintaraj 26\" \n\n== Recruitment, selection and training ==\n[[File:Anti terrorism students.jpg|thumb|332x332px|Anti terrorism students were struggling with their running team test. The condition of the test will be 800 meters running with full equipment with five members in the team within indicated time by their instructors, which is 3.30 mins.]]\nMembers of the Royal Thai police with at least two years of service, Freshmen who graduated from Police Academy and Freshmen who graduated from Police Cadet Academy can apply for the selection process of the Arintaraj 26. \n\nThe test has the following:\n\n* Medical examination\n* Psychological examination\n* Physical tests, which includes 1.6 km run, 100 m swim, sit up, pull-ups, push-ups, and obstacle course\n* Final interview\n\n[[File:Anti terrorism course.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Anti terrorism students whose completed the missions ordered by their instructors.]]\nThe brutal 18 weeks training period includes eight weeks of basic training and ten weeks of special training. The identity of Arintaraj 26 units is classified as Royal Thai Police's final answer.

Pol.Col.Chumpon Attasat Superintendent  of the Riot Control and Suppression Sub-Division had established a special operation unit called \"Anti-Hijacker\". He has selected police officers within the unit who were physically, mentally and intellectually ready to the specified qualifications to attend the training in order to cater for missions of the international nature. During the training,  there was no financial support not even for the meals of the attendees. Therefore, participants joined in this training with their hearts and ideologies. After Pol.Col.Chumpon Attasit was assigned to take a position in a different unit the special operation had changed. \n\nIn 1983 There was an international terrorism incident and insurgency in Thailand particularly in Bangkok. Pol.Maj.General Thip Asawarak Commander of Patrol and Special Operations Division at that time had resurrected the special operation unit. He requested the Royal Thai Police department for the authorization of an international training plan for the special operation unit similar to GSG9 in Germany. Later in 1984, The Royal Thai Police department ordered the establishment  of a special operation unit within the Metropolitan Police Bureau, using the name of special operation unit  \"Arintaraj 26\" \n\n== Recruitment, selection and training ==\n[[File:Anti terrorism students.jpg|thumb|332x332px|Anti terrorism students were struggling with their running team test. The condition of the test will be 800 meters running with full equipment with five members in the team within indicated time by their instructors, which is 3.30 mins.]]\nMembers of the Royal Thai police with at least two years of service, Freshmen who graduated from Police Academy and Freshmen who graduated from Police Cadet Academy can apply for the selection process of the Arintaraj 26. \n\nThe test has the following:\n\n* Medical examination\n* Psychological examination\n* Physical tests, which includes 1.6 km run, 100 m swim, sit up, pull-ups, push-ups, and obstacle course\n* Final interview\n\n[[File:Anti terrorism course.jpg|thumb|337x337px|Anti terrorism students whose completed the missions ordered by their instructors.]]\nThe brutal 18 weeks training period includes eight weeks of basic training and ten weeks of special training. The identity of Arintaraj 26 units is classified as Royal Thai Police's final answer. Further training often involves co-operation with other allied counter-terrorism units such as '''Thai navy seal,''' '''RTAF Security Force Regiment, Special Operation Battalion, Naresuan 261.'''

[[United States]]. The population was 7,087 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] of Franklin County.<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBenton, the county seat of Franklin County, took its name from the prominent senator from [[Missouri]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] (1782-1858). The village of Benton was organized in 1841 on {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of property donated by John Ewing and Walter S. Akin. In 1902 the village became a city, and incorporated under the mayor/commissioner form of government.\n\nFranklin County was platted in 1818, the year Illinois became a state, at twice its current size. It included the territory that is now [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]]. In 1839 the county was split roughly in half and the county seat was permanently fixed \"at a hill at the south end of Rowling's Prairie\", the site of the future city of Benton.\n\nThe [[Franklin County Courthouse (Illinois)|Franklin County Courthouse]] sits in the center of the Public Square. It is the third courthouse that has served the people of Franklin County. The Italianate building was constructed in 1874\u201375 at a cost of $27,500.00\n\nMuch of Benton's growth in the past can be traced to the abundance of high sulfur coal, the presence of multiple railroads, rich soil and the industry of her people.\n\nOn April 19, 1928 Benton was the site of the last public hanging in Illinois, when local gangster [[Charles Birger]] was executed on the gallows next to the county jail  for the December 12, 1926 murder of Joe Adams, mayor of nearby [[West City, Illinois]]. A replica of the gallows and hangman's noose were built by the late retired Old Ben Coal miner, businessman & carpenter, Birchard L. Wampler <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbwilson.com/gpw/Home.html |title=Birchard L. Wampler |publisher=Tbwilson.com |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406152000/http://www.tbwilson.com/gpw/Home.html |archivedate=2012-04-06 }}</ref> (March 9, 1938 \u2013 June 29, 2010) and his son Birchard Neil Wampler. They remain standing today next to the old Franklin County Jail turned Museum.\n\nIn September 1963, [[George Harrison]] of [[The Beatles]] visited Benton while on vacation, the first time any member of the group visited American soil. He stayed at the home of his sister, Louise, at 113 McCann Street. The bungalow used to be the Hard Day's Nite Bed and Breakfast. During his trip he traveled from Benton to Fenton's Music Store in Mt. Vernon, IL to purchase a Rickenbacker 425 that later sold at auction for $657k. Harrison also performed with a band called \"The Four Vests\" at the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall in [[Eldorado, Illinois]]. In an interview, Harrison's sister Louise said \"his real first visit to America was when he came to the midwest in September 1963 and he met these wonderful, warm, friendly, real warm Midwesterners... school teachers, retired miners and all kinds of just wonderful people... and a little band. He had a fantastic time. He thought they were just wonderful people.\"<ref>http://www.classicbands.com/LouiseHarrisonInterview.html</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, a 16-foot tall commemorative mural of George Harrison was created and donated California artist John Cerney.

[[United States]]. The population was 7,087 at the 2010 census. It is the [[county seat]] of Franklin County.<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBenton, the county seat of Franklin County, took its name from the prominent senator from [[Missouri]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] (1782-1858). The village of Benton was organized in 1841 on {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of property donated by John Ewing and Walter S. Akin. In 1902 the village became a city, and incorporated under the mayor/commissioner form of government.\n\nFranklin County was platted in 1818, the year Illinois became a state, at twice its current size. It included the territory that is now [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]]. In 1839 the county was split roughly in half and the county seat was permanently fixed \"at a hill at the south end of Rowling's Prairie\", the site of the future city of Benton.\n\nThe [[Franklin County Courthouse (Illinois)|Franklin County Courthouse]] sits in the center of the Public Square. It is the third courthouse that has served the people of Franklin County. The Italianate building was constructed in 1874-75 at a cost of $27,500.00\n\nMuch of Benton's growth in the past can be traced to the abundance of high sulfur coal, the presence of multiple railroads, rich soil and the industry of her people.\n\nOn April 19, 1928 Benton was the site of the last public hanging in Illinois, when local gangster [[Charles Birger]] was executed on the gallows next to the county jail  for the December 12, 1926 murder of Joe Adams, mayor of nearby [[West City, Illinois]]. A replica of the gallows and hangman's noose were built by the late retired Old Ben Coal miner, businessman & carpenter, Birchard L. Wampler <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbwilson.com/gpw/Home.html |title=Birchard L. Wampler |publisher=Tbwilson.com |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406152000/http://www.tbwilson.com/gpw/Home.html |archivedate=2012-04-06 }}</ref> (March 9, 1938 \u2013 June 29, 2010) and his son Birchard Neil Wampler. They remain standing today next to the old Franklin County Jail turned Museum.\n\nIn September 1963, [[George Harrison]] of [[The Beatles]] visited Benton while on vacation, the first time any member of the group visited American soil. He stayed at the home of his sister, Louise, at 113 McCann Street. The bungalow used to be the Hard Day's Nite Bed and Breakfast. During his trip he traveled from Benton to Fenton's Music Store in Mt. Vernon, IL to purchase a Rickenbacker 425 that later sold at auction for $657k. Harrison also performed with a band called \"The Four Vests\" at the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] hall in [[Eldorado, Illinois]]. In an interview, Harrison's sister Louise said \"his real first visit to America was when he came to the midwest in September 1963 and he met these wonderful, warm, friendly, real warm Midwesterners... school teachers, retired miners and all kinds of just wonderful people... and a little band. He had a fantastic time. He thought they were just wonderful people.\"<ref>http://www.classicbands.com/LouiseHarrisonInterview.html</ref>\n\nIn August 2017, a 16-foot tall commemorative mural of George Harrison was created and donated California artist John Cerney. Cerney caught word of Harrison's memorable visit to the town on a Sirius radio program, which inspired Cerney's creation. The \"highway art\" can be found facing southbound traffic along Interstate 57. The project was completed just in time for tourists to admire it as they traveled through the city for the Total Solar Eclipse of 2017.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the 2010 census, Benton has a total area of {{convert|5.66|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|5.48|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 96.82%) is land and {{convert|0.18|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 3.18%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1705300\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213083059/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1705300\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n=== Benton Public Library ===\n[[Benton Public Library]] serves all residents of Benton High School District.  \n[http://www.benton.lib.il.us www.benton.lib.il.us]\n\n==Media==\nBenton and surrounding areas are served by two weekly newspapers, ''[[The Benton Evening News|The Benton News]]'' and ''The Benton Gazette''.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 380\n|1870= 615\n|1880= 984\n|1890= 939\n|1900= 1341\n|1910= 2675\n|1920= 7201\n|1930= 8219\n|1940= 7372\n|1950= 7848\n|1960= 7023\n|1970= 6833\n|1980= 7778\n|1990= 7216\n|2000= 6880\n|2010= 7087\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6913\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 6,880 people, 2,938 households, and 1,824 families residing in the city.

Formed in 2012,  the original lineup was composed of Spiller, Slack, bassist Jamie Binns and drummer Rafe Thomas.\n\nThe band's influences include [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Darkness (band)|the Darkness]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Def Leppard]], [[the Killers]], [[the Smiths]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[the Libertines]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[the Strokes]], and [[My Chemical Romance]]. <ref name=\"AllMusic Bio\">{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=John D.|title=The Struts|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-struts-mn0003131865/biography|website=All Music|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Popular anti social\">{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Ilana|title=Introducing the Struts|url=http://www.populartv.com/music/introducing-the-struts/|website=Popular|publisher=Popular|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Struts, Hello Operator, Titan\u2019s Troubadours|url=http://www.fibbers.co.uk/live-events/detail/the-struts-hello-operator/|website=Fibbers|publisher=Fibbers|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=Hits />\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years===\n[[File:The Struts.jpg|thumb|upright|Luke Spiller performing in 2012]]\nSinger-songwriter Luke Spiller was raised in [[Bristol]] in a [[Christians|Christian]] family. His exposure to music was mainly limited to [[gospel music]], until the age of seven, when he discovered [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''. Inspired by Jackson, his first aspirations were to be a contemporary dancer, but by the age of 11, he was listening to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Leonard Cohen]], and in addition to pretending to be Jackson in front of a mirror, he was imitating [[Bon Scott]] and [[Freddie Mercury]]. He began playing in bands as a teenager, only starting to sing at age 16.<ref name=\"Popular anti social\" /><ref name=\"gettothefront.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gettothefront.co.uk/2012/11/interview-the-struts/|title=Interview: The Struts - GetToTheFront|work=GetToTheFront}}</ref><ref name=\"Birmingham Mail\">{{cite news|last1=Probert|first1=Sarah|title=Indie Newcomers Ready to Strut Their Stuff|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/preview-struts-play-hare-hounds-7143854|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=20 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=WMN>{{cite news|last1=B.|first1=Jackie|title=The Struts Devon Frontman is Ready to Seize the Crown|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Struts-Devon-frontman-ready-seize-rock-s-crown/story-21166219-detail/story.html|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Western Morning News|date=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824211011/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Struts-Devon-frontman-ready-seize-rock-s-crown/story-21166219-detail/story.html|archivedate=24 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Radio>{{cite web|last1=Tilles|first1=Jay|title=The Struts Channel Classic British Rock Icons|url=http://radio.com/2015/09/30/the-struts-interview/|website=radio.com|publisher=Radio|accessdate=22 October 2015|date=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Spiller, then living in [[Clevedon]], met Derby-based guitarist/songwriter Adam Slack, who had also been playing with bands since his teens. At the time, each of their bands were \"coming apart,\" and Slack and Spiller quickly connected musically. Spiller moved to Derby, where he and Slack lived, wrote, and recorded together for nearly three years. They recruited mutual friends Jamie Binns and Rafe Thomas to play bass and drums. In 2012, Binns and Thomas were replaced with bassist Jed Elliott and drummer Gethin Davies, forming the Struts.<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite news|last1 = Ryan|first1 = Patrick|title = On The Verge: The Struts|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/09/03/--verge--struts-could-have-been-me/71425846/|accessdate = 21 October 2015|newspaper = USA Today|date = 14 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Coatsville Times\">{{cite news|last1=Dyroff|first1=Denny|title=On Stage|url=http://coatesvilletimes.com/?p=11291|accessdate=22 October 2015|publisher=Coatesville Times|date=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2016 RiP The Struts - by 2eight - 8SC9273.jpg|thumb|Co-founders Adam Slack (left) and Luke Spiller (right) performing at [[Rock im Park]] 2016]]\nThe band chose the name the Struts based on an offhand comment made at a rehearsal. Spiller said in a 2015 interview, \"I was just moving around and somebody was like, 'you strut around a lot.' From then on, we knew we had a great name. We couldn't believe it hadn't been taken.\"<ref name=\"Popular anti social\" /><ref name=\"Birmingham Mail\"/><ref name=\"WMN\"/><ref name=\"Radio\"/>\n \nThe band played frequently throughout the UK. They soon developed a following and released their first single, \"I Just Know\", in June 2012. Signed by Future Records, they were transferred to [[Virgin EMI Records|Virgin EMI]] after Future's demise and subsequently put out a four-track EP titled ''Kiss This''.\n\nThe Struts toured extensively in England and France, and in 2014 performed for 80,000 people as the opener for [[the Rolling Stones]] in Paris. That summer, they did a 24-date tour, which included a gig at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]]. Spiller wore clothing designed for him by [[Zandra Rhodes]], who formerly dressed Freddie Mercury. The production of Rhodes' clothing for Spiller was later featured on the [[BBC]] documentary ''Oh You Pretty Things: The Story of Music and Fashion''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0278wnj |title=BBC Four - Oh You Pretty Things: The Story of Music and Fashion, Idols, Zandra Rhodes designs for Luke Spiller of The Struts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Derby Telegraph\">{{cite news|last1=Hawley|first1=Zena|title=The Struts: Derby band to support Rolling Stones in Paris gig|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Struts-Derby-band-support-Rolling-Stones-Paris/story-21152518-detail/story.html|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=28 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031001705/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Struts-Derby-band-support-Rolling-Stones-Paris/story-21152518-detail/story.html|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs the Struts reputation as a live band grew, their audience increased, and their shows were frequently sold-out. Spiller's talent as a frontman was often noted by the press and reviews described him as \"a force of nature\" and as a \"physical, mesmerising entertainer... vocally strong, expressive and blessed with excellent range\".  Spiller's looks and stage presence led Roger Goodgroves of ''Get To the Front'' to describe him as \"the musical love child of Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger\".<ref name=\"gettothefront.co.uk\"/>\n\n[[Mike Oldfield]] recruited Spiller to sing on his 2014 album ''[[Man on the Rocks]]''.

His exposure to music was mainly limited to [[gospel music]], until the age of seven, when he discovered [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''. Inspired by Jackson, his first aspirations were to be a contemporary dancer, but by the age of 11, he was listening to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Leonard Cohen]], and in addition to pretending to be Jackson in front of a mirror, he was imitating [[Bon Scott]] and [[Freddie Mercury]]. He began playing in bands as a teenager, only starting to sing at age 16.<ref name=\"Popular anti social\" /><ref name=\"gettothefront.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gettothefront.co.uk/2012/11/interview-the-struts/|title=Interview: The Struts - GetToTheFront|work=GetToTheFront}}</ref><ref name=\"Birmingham Mail\">{{cite news|last1=Probert|first1=Sarah|title=Indie Newcomers Ready to Strut Their Stuff|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/preview-struts-play-hare-hounds-7143854|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=20 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=WMN>{{cite news|last1=B.|first1=Jackie|title=The Struts Devon Frontman is Ready to Seize the Crown|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Struts-Devon-frontman-ready-seize-rock-s-crown/story-21166219-detail/story.html|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Western Morning News|date=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824211011/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Struts-Devon-frontman-ready-seize-rock-s-crown/story-21166219-detail/story.html|archivedate=24 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Radio>{{cite web|last1=Tilles|first1=Jay|title=The Struts Channel Classic British Rock Icons|url=http://radio.com/2015/09/30/the-struts-interview/|website=radio.com|publisher=Radio|accessdate=22 October 2015|date=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Spiller, then living in [[Clevedon]], met Derby-based guitarist/songwriter Adam Slack, who had also been playing with bands since his teens. At the time, each of their bands were \"coming apart,\" and Slack and Spiller quickly connected musically. Spiller moved to Derby, where he and Slack lived, wrote, and recorded together for nearly three years. They recruited mutual friends Jamie Binns and Rafe Thomas to play bass and drums. In 2012, Binns and Thomas were replaced with bassist Jed Elliott and drummer Gethin Davies, forming the Struts.<ref name=\"USA Today\">{{cite news|last1 = Ryan|first1 = Patrick|title = On The Verge: The Struts|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/09/03/--verge--struts-could-have-been-me/71425846/|accessdate = 21 October 2015|newspaper = USA Today|date = 14 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Coatsville Times\">{{cite news|last1=Dyroff|first1=Denny|title=On Stage|url=http://coatesvilletimes.com/?p=11291|accessdate=22 October 2015|publisher=Coatesville Times|date=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2016 RiP The Struts - by 2eight - 8SC9273.jpg|thumb|Co-founders Adam Slack (left) and Luke Spiller (right) performing at [[Rock im Park]] 2016]]\nThe band chose the name the Struts based on an offhand comment made at a rehearsal. Spiller said in a 2015 interview, \"I was just moving around and somebody was like, 'you strut around a lot.' From then on, we knew we had a great name. We couldn't believe it hadn't been taken.\"<ref name=\"Popular anti social\" /><ref name=\"Birmingham Mail\"/><ref name=\"WMN\"/><ref name=\"Radio\"/>\n \nThe band played frequently throughout the UK. They soon developed a following and released their first single, \"I Just Know\", in June 2012. Signed by Future Records, they were transferred to [[Virgin EMI Records|Virgin EMI]] after Future's demise and subsequently put out a four-track EP titled ''Kiss This''.\n\nThe Struts toured extensively in England and France, and in 2014 performed for 80,000 people as the opener for [[the Rolling Stones]] in Paris. That summer, they did a 24-date tour, which included a gig at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]]. Spiller wore clothing designed for him by [[Zandra Rhodes]], who formerly dressed Freddie Mercury. The production of Rhodes' clothing for Spiller was later featured on the [[BBC]] documentary ''Oh You Pretty Things: The Story of Music and Fashion''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0278wnj |title=BBC Four - Oh You Pretty Things: The Story of Music and Fashion, Idols, Zandra Rhodes designs for Luke Spiller of The Struts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-09-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Derby Telegraph\">{{cite news|last1=Hawley|first1=Zena|title=The Struts: Derby band to support Rolling Stones in Paris gig|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Struts-Derby-band-support-Rolling-Stones-Paris/story-21152518-detail/story.html|accessdate=22 October 2015|newspaper=Derby Telegraph|date=28 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031001705/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Struts-Derby-band-support-Rolling-Stones-Paris/story-21152518-detail/story.html|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs the Struts reputation as a live band grew, their audience increased, and their shows were frequently sold-out. Spiller's talent as a frontman was often noted by the press and reviews described him as \"a force of nature\" and as a \"physical, mesmerising entertainer... vocally strong, expressive and blessed with excellent range\".  Spiller's looks and stage presence led Roger Goodgroves of ''Get To the Front'' to describe him as \"the musical love child of Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger\".<ref name=\"gettothefront.co.uk\"/>\n\n[[Mike Oldfield]] recruited Spiller to sing on his 2014 album ''[[Man on the Rocks]]''.
