They can be programmed using any [[.NET Framework]] programming language, though they are most commonly written in [[C sharp (programming language)|C#]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.boltbait.com/pdn/codelab/|title=CodeLab: Paint.NET Plugin Development Environment|date = August 16, 2014 <!-- CodeLab 2.3 Released -->}}</ref> These are created by volunteer coders on the program's discussion board, the paint.net Forum. Though most are simply published via the discussion board, some have been included with a later release of the program. For instance, a [[DirectDraw Surface]] file type plugin, (originally by Dean Ashton) and an Ink Sketch and Soften Portrait effect (originally by David Issel) were added to Paint.net in version 3.10.\n\nHundreds of plugins have been produced;<ref name=\"pluginindex\">{{Cite web|url=http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/15260-plugin-index/|title=Plugin Index}}</ref> such as Shape3D, which renders a 2D drawing into a 3D shape. Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.net, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.\n\nExamples of file type plugins include an ''Animated Cursor and Icon'' plugin and an ''Adobe Photoshop file format plugin''.<ref name=\"pluginindex\" /> Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a [[raw image format]] plugin that uses [[dcraw]] and a PNG optimization plugin that uses [[OptiPNG]].\n\n==Forks==\n\n===paint-mono===\nPaint.net was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, [[Miguel de Icaza]] officially started a [[porting]] project called ''paint-mono''.<ref name=\"paint-mono\" /> This project had partially ported Paint.net 3.0 to [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open-source implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] on which the .NET Framework is based. This allowed Paint.net to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as [[Linux]]. <!-- As of December 2010, -->This port is no longer maintained and has not been updated since March 2009.<ref name=\"paint-mono\">Project [http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ Paint Mono] at [[Google Code]]<!-- Archive https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ --></ref>\n\n===Pinta===\n{{main|Pinta (software)}}\nIn 2010 developer Jonathan Pobst started a project called [[Pinta (software)|Pinta]], describing it <!-- by the developer and the osnews article --> as a clone of Paint.net for Mono and [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]. Pinta reused the adjustments and effects code from Paint.net but otherwise is original code.<ref name=\"ref-osnews\" />\n\n==Releases==\n<!-- Please only add significant changes/improvements.

Its native image format, .PDN, is a [[data compression|compressed]] representation of the application's internal [[object (computer science)|object]] format, which preserves layering and other information.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Paint.NET's file format, \".pdn\"|url= http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2005/01/18/355571.aspx|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102165718/http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2005/01/18/355571.aspx|archivedate = 2008-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Plugins==\nPaint.net supports [[Plugin (computing)|plugins]], which add image adjustments, effects, and support for additional file types. They can be programmed using any [[.NET Framework]] programming language, though they are most commonly written in [[C sharp (programming language)|C#]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.boltbait.com/pdn/codelab/|title=CodeLab: Paint.NET Plugin Development Environment|date = August 16, 2014 <!-- CodeLab 2.3 Released -->}}</ref> These are created by volunteer coders on the program's discussion board, the paint.net Forum. Though most are simply published via the discussion board, some have been included with a later release of the program. For instance, a [[DirectDraw Surface]] file type plugin, (originally by Dean Ashton) and an Ink Sketch and Soften Portrait effect (originally by David Issel) were added to Paint.net in version 3.10.\n\nHundreds of plugins have been produced;<ref name=\"pluginindex\">{{Cite web|url=http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/15260-plugin-index/|title=Plugin Index}}</ref> such as Shape3D, which renders a 2D drawing into a 3D shape. Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.net, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.\n\nExamples of file type plugins include an ''Animated Cursor and Icon'' plugin and an ''Adobe Photoshop file format plugin''.<ref name=\"pluginindex\" /> Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a [[raw image format]] plugin that uses [[dcraw]] and a PNG optimization plugin that uses [[OptiPNG]].\n\n==Forks==\n\n===paint-mono===\nPaint.net was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, [[Miguel de Icaza]] officially started a [[porting]] project called ''paint-mono''.<ref name=\"paint-mono\" /> This project had partially ported Paint.net 3.0 to [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open-source implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] on which the .NET Framework is based. This allowed Paint.net to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as [[Linux]]. <!-- As of December 2010, -->This port is no longer maintained and has not been updated since March 2009.<ref name=\"paint-mono\">Project [http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ Paint Mono] at [[Google Code]]<!-- Archive https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ --></ref>\n\n===Pinta===\n{{main|Pinta (software)}}\nIn 2010 developer Jonathan Pobst started a project called [[Pinta (software)|Pinta]], describing it <!-- by the developer and the osnews article --> as a clone of Paint.net for Mono and [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]. Pinta reused the adjustments and effects code from Paint.net but otherwise is original code.<ref name=\"ref-osnews\" />\n\n==Releases==\n<!-- Please only add significant changes/improvements.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915. The 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Action ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the 1st. (Ontario) Battalion., CEF; replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, BN. GGFG.\n\n\n\u201cQuietly\u201d Introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 First casualties, 2 wounded, that same day. First fatality Aug. 26 . Eventually 17 KIA/25 WIA in this intro.\n\nParticipated in first trench raid Sep. 16 \u2013 35 casualties out of 60 engaged.\n<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were RCR, and PPCLI)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Guards unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V  in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

Private Young was in Kidderminster, England at the time and received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace in April 1919. That month, he married Ida May Thatcher at St. Mary\u2019s Church in Kidderminster. He took his bride back to Canada, but sadly did not enjoy a long life, dying in 1929.\n\n=== Commemorations / Plaques honouring John Francis Young, VC ===\n\n*'''''Montreal, Canada'''''\n\nA historic tribute plaque was unveiled by The Canadian Grenadier Guards and placed with Sergeant Young's Heads Stone in [[Mount Royal Cemetery]]. The [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]]' Junior Ranks mess has been renamed the \"John Francis Young Club\" in his honour and still bears his name. In Young's honour, members are required to execute a proper halt, briefly coming to attention, upon entering the Club. There is a memorial plaque to him in the Sergeants' mess.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915. The 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks.

''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''   \n* Title of Guardsman was awarded   \n\n<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.
