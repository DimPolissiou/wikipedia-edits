As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other. However, with Mork's dangerous life still troubling him, Sun makes it clear that he is there because he cares for him.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref>{{cite web

As Kao's sister goes to college, he supports his mom financially by doing part-time tutoring to high school students. The director of the school where his mom works asks Kao to tutor his son, Non ([[Chayapol Jutamat]]), after hearing that he is a good tutor. Pete crosses paths with Non in a competition and pisses him off after learning that Kao is tutoring him. With Non fueling Pete's jealousy, his relationship with Kao gets tested in several occasions.\n\nSun ([[Supakorn Sriphotong]]), who was pursuing Kao before, has been nagging Mork ([[Gawin Caskey]]) for dragging his younger brother, Rain ([[Pluem Pongpisal]]) into his troubles. To help him change his life, Sun offers Mork a job in his caf\u00e9. Along the way, the two of them start to care for each other.

In Romanian slang the generic word for a prison is \"gherl\u01ce\", after the institution.\n\n==Location==\n\nThe prison is located adjacent to the city of [[Gherla]] near the [[Some\u0219 River]] (called Szamos in Hungarian).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe basic structure came from the fortress of Gherla or \"Szamos-uj-var\" (equivalent to [[transliteration]] from Hungarian, meaning \"New castle on the Szamos\") built around 1540 by [[George Martinuzzi]], archbishop, cardinal and Imperial Treasurer of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]].\n\nThrough the Imperial Decree of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], dated October 20, 1785 this fortress was transformed into \"Carcer Magni Principatus Transilvanie\" (i.e.: The Major Prison of Transylvanian Principality).\n\nGherla prison has a very large underground area.

During the 1960s it was reported that the prison was housing over 15,000 inmates.\n\nThroughout its history under the Austrian Empire, then Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary and finally Romania the penitentiary also hosted various industrial activities.\n\nMany Romanian military officers who had initially fought against the [[Soviet Army]] in [[World War II]] were locked into the Gherla Prison by the Communist regime after the end of the war.

In October 2006 the [[European Roma Rights Centre]] complained to the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] about violence against Romani in the country, racial targeting and profiling by police against Romani, discrimination in social programs and employment against Romani, and the widespread lack of necessary documentation for Roma to enjoy access to social services and protections. In many areas of the country, poverty often forced Romani families to withdraw their children from school. There were numerous reports of Romani being evicted from housing, removed from public transportation, denied public assistance, kicked out of stores, and denied proper medical treatment.<ref name=\"Roma\"/> According to the [[Roma Congress of Ukraine]], the findings of the 2003 national study on social integration of Romani remain current: only 38 percent of Romani are economically active, 21 percent have [[permanent employment]], and 5 percent have temporary employment, mainly seasonal jobs. Representatives of Romani and other minority groups claimed that police officials routinely ignored, and sometimes abetted, violence against them.<ref name=\"Roma\"/> In 2012 the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) reported that \"Many Roma do not dispose of basic identity documents.

Also, in early 2008, there were several guilty verdicts handed down in cases of violence in which incitement to hatred based on [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or [[religion]] were among the charges. However, these verdicts were exceptions to a pattern in which violent crimes with an apparent bias motivation are more often treated as hooliganism. [[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] officials lack training and experience in recognizing and recording the bias motivations behind attacks, limiting the ability of prosecutors to pursue hate crime cases in court.

There were numerous reports of Romani being evicted from housing, removed from public transportation, denied public assistance, kicked out of stores, and denied proper medical treatment.<ref name=\"Roma\"/> According to the [[Roma Congress of Ukraine]], the findings of the 2003 national study on social integration of Romani remain current: only 38 percent of Romani are economically active, 21 percent have [[permanent employment]], and 5 percent have temporary employment, mainly seasonal jobs. Representatives of Romani and other minority groups claimed that police officials routinely ignored, and sometimes abetted, violence against them.<ref name=\"Roma\"/> In 2012 the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) reported that \"Many Roma do not dispose of basic identity documents. This seriously affects their access to social rights as well as the right to vote.\"<ref name=\"ECRI2012reportUkraine\"/>\n\nThere were some reports that the government was addressing the longstanding problems faced by the Romani community. For example, the [[Chirikli fund]] reported in fall 2006 that a court in [[Odessa]] reviewed its complaint against a school director who refused to admit a Romani child to school. The court refused to review claims of discrimination but the case was still under review for possible administrative violations as of December. A court in [[Donetsk]] refused to accept a similar complaint.<ref name=\"Roma\">[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100590.htm] [[US department of state]] Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Ukraine</ref> However, in 2012 ECRI stated \"government policies themselves at times appear also to ignore the situation of marginalisation and discrimination faced by Roma\".<ref name=\"ECRI2012reportUkraine\"/>\n\n===Discrimination against Tatars===\nIn [[Crimea]],{{#tag:ref|The status of Crimea and of the city of [[Sevastopol]] is currently [[Political status of Crimea|under dispute between Russia and Ukraine]]; Ukraine and the majority of the international community consider the Crimea to be an [[Autonomous republics of Ukraine|autonomous republic of Ukraine]] and Sevastopol to be one of Ukraine's [[city with special status|cities with special status]], while Russia, on the other hand, considers the Crimea to be a [[federal subject of Russia]] and Sevastopol to be one of Russia's three [[federal cities of Russia|federal cities]].<ref name=\"Reuters\">{{cite web|last1=Gutterman |first1=Steve|last2=Polityuk|first2=Pavel|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140318 |title=Putin signs Crimea treaty as Ukraine serviceman dies in attack |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Ukraine crisis timeline BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26248275|title=Ukraine crisis: Timeline|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CCTV UNR C=U\">{{cite news|editor=Bai Yang|url=http://english.cntv.cn/2014/03/28/ARTI1395947928472439.shtml|title=UN General Assembly adopts resolution affirming Ukraine's territorial integrity|publisher=[[China Central Television]]|date=28 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304200543/http://english.cntv.cn/2014/03/28/ARTI1395947928472439.shtml|archive-date=2018-03-04|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>|group=nb}} native [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]] feel discriminated due to lack of lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1078529.html|title=Ukraine: A Bittersweet Homecoming For Crimea's Tatars|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=5 September 2007|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> Conflicts between Tatars and their [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] neighbors in recent years has led to massed fist fights, vandalizing graveyards<ref name=\"ECRI2012reportUkraine\"/> and even murders.

According to the report, more than 60 people were targeted in racist violence in 2007, six of them killed; More than 30 people were victims of racist attacks since the beginning of 2008 and at least four had been killed at the time of the report. Rights advocates are puzzled by the rise in hate crimes but they claim government inaction is partly to blame. They also claim the government aggravates the problem by denying that racism is growing and only acknowledging isolated incidents. Rights groups claim Ukrainian hate groups are inspired by their counterparts in Russia. Russian skinheads help the local groups, they say, sharing tips and video clips on how to attack and torture their victims and how to safely leave the crime scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/top/29245/|title=Ukraine grapples with alarming rise in hate crimes as it pursues EU dreams|work=Kyiv Post|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=18 July 2008}}</ref> According to the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (in February 2012) since 2008 \"progress has been made in a number of fields\".<ref name=\"ECRI2012reportUkraine\"/>\n\n==Government response==\nThe government's response to the recent surge in hate crimes has been insufficient and inconsistent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and some other senior government officials have spoken out against racist and xenophobic violence. However, these statements have been undermined by other declarations by some key law enforcement officials whose remarks suggested a denial of the problem.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} On March 30, 2007, former Interior Minister [[Vasyl Tsushko]] condemned acts of xenophobia and racism at a meeting of representatives of embassies and international organizations. Tsushko denied any massive instances of xenophobic incidents in Ukraine, but recognized that single incidents could lead to an overall negative tendency.\n\nThe authorities did take some important steps in 2007, including the creation of specialized units in key government agencies. Also, in early 2008, there were several guilty verdicts handed down in cases of violence in which incitement to hatred based on [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or [[religion]] were among the charges. However, these verdicts were exceptions to a pattern in which violent crimes with an apparent bias motivation are more often treated as hooliganism. [[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] officials lack training and experience in recognizing and recording the bias motivations behind attacks, limiting the ability of prosecutors to pursue hate crime cases in court. An inadequate legal framework also hinders the ability of criminal justice officials to prosecute hate crimes as such.<ref name=\"HRFreport-govtresponse\"/>\n\nIn November 2009 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament) adopted a law that raised the maximum sentences for crimes committed on the ground of racial, national, or religious hostility.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/51976/|title=Rada toughens punishment for crimes on ground of racial, national, or religious hostility|agency=Ukrainian News Agency|via=''Kyiv Post''|date=5 November 2009|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics on violent crime motivated by racism and discrimination==\nThere is no government data collection or regular public reporting expressly on violent hate crimes.

After Juru failed to recognize him, Tametomo developed an antagonistic relationship with him, questioning his every move and talking back to him every so often. This came to a head when a jealous Shovellow convinced Tametomo to take Juru's position away from him, only to get suspended for botching a mission. Though he quit out of anger, the girls helped Tametomo realize he never wanted the leadership role anyway and that Juru was always more qualified in the first place.
