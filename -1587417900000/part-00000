[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] defines ''gotra'' for grammatical purposes as ''apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram'' (IV. 1. 162), which means \"the word ''gotra'' denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son.\" When a person says \"I am Vipparla-gotra\", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.\n\nAccording to the ''Brihadaranyaka [[Upanisad]]'' 2.2.6, ''Gautama and Bharadv\u0101ja, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Ka\u015bhyapa and Shandilya'' are seven sages (also known as [[saptarishi]]); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to P\u0101\u1e47ini. The offspring (''apatya'') of these seven are gotras and others than these are called ''gotr\u00e2vayava''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vedah.net/manasanskriti/Brahmins.html|title=Brahmin, brahmana, caste, tribe, gotra, rishi, ritual, india, hindu, religion, Mana Sanskriti (Our Culture), Issue 69|work=vedah.net|date=October 2003}}</ref>\n\nOne who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as ''tri-a-rishaye''.

Many theories have been propounded to explain this system. According to the vedic theories, the [[Brahmin]]s are direct descendants of seven sages who are believed to be the sons of Brahma, borne out of his mind through yogic prowess. They are (1) [[Gautama Maharishi]], (2) [[Bharadwaja]], (3) [[Vishvamitra]], (4) [[Jamadagni]], (5) [[Vashista]], (6) [[Kashyapa]] and (7) [[Atri]] . To this list, [[Agastya]] is also sometimes added. These eight sages are called gotrakarins, from whom all 49 gotras (especially of the Brahmins) have evolved. For instance, from [[Atri]] sprang the Atreya and Gavisthiras gotras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurjari.net/ico/Mystica/html/gotra.htm|title=Gotra|work=gurjari.net|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Robert Vane Russell]], many gotra of hindu caste are of [[totem]]ic origin which are named after plants, animals and natural objects. These are universal among non-aryan or primitive tribes, but occurs also in Hindu castes. The commonest totem names are those of animals, including several which are held sacred by hindus, as bagh or nahar, the tiger; bachas, the calf; murkuria, the peacock; kachhua or limun, the tortoise; nagas, the cobra; hasti, the elephant; bhainsa, the buffalo; richaria, the bear; Kuliha, the Jackal, kurura, the dog; karsayal, the dear; hiran, the black-buck and so on.

A kula is equal to a particular family , or equal to modern day \"clans\",  Kula does relate to lineage or ''caste.''\n\n==Marriages and gotras==\nMarriages within the gotra ('sagotra' marriages) are not permitted under the rule of [[exogamy]] in the traditional matrimonial system. The compound word 'sagotra' is a union of the words 'sa' and 'gotra', where 'sa' means same or similar. It is common practice in preparation for [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage to inquire about the kula-gotra (meaning clan lineage) of the bride and groom before approving the marriage. People within the gotra are regarded as [[siblings]] and marrying such a person would be thought of as taboo. In almost all Hindu families, marriage within the same gotra is not encouraged or practised since they are believed to be descended from the same family. Marriages between different gotras are therefore encouraged. But marriage within the [[J\u0101ti|jaati]] is allowed and even preferred.\n\nFor example, [[Jats]] and [[Rajputs]] have 3000 Gotras and [[Mudiraju|Mudirajas]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] have 2600 Gotras. Gotra is always passed on from father to children among most Hindus. However, among the [[Malayali]] and [[Tulu people]] it is passed on from mother to child.\n\nThe tatsama words 'sahodara' (brother) and 'sahodari' (sister) derive their roots from the Sanskrit word 'saha udara' (\u0938\u0939\u094b\u0926\u0930) meaning co-uterine or born of the same womb. In communities where gotra membership passed from father to children, marriages were allowed between a woman and her maternal uncle,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|title=India \u2013 Marriage|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> while such marriages were forbidden in [[matrilineal]] communities, like [[Thiyyar]]s and [[Tuluva]]s, where gotra membership was passed down from the mother.\n\nA much more common characteristic of South Indian Hindu society is permission for marriage between [[cross-cousin]]s (children of brother and sister) as they are of different gotras. Thus, a man is allowed to marry his maternal uncle's daughter or his paternal aunt's daughter, but is not allowed to marry his paternal uncle's daughter. She would be considered a [[parallel cousin]], of the same gotra, and therefore to be treated as a sister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://neurologyasia.org/articles/20073_015.pdf|title=Arranged marriage, consanguinity and epilepsy|author=Mehndiratta MM; Paul B and Mehndiratta P|journal=Neurology Asia |year=2007|volume =12 |issue=Supplement 1|pages=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\n[[North Indian]] [[Hindu]] society not only follows the rules of gotra for marriages, but also has many regulations which go beyond the basic definition of gotra and has a broader definition of incest.<ref>[http://anthro.palomar.edu/marriage/marriage_3.htm Sex and Marriage: Marriage Rules (Part 1)]. palomar.edu.</ref> Some communities in North India do not allow marriage with certain other clans, based on the belief that both clans are of the same patrilineal descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/|title=Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage|work=indianexpress.com|author=Vashisht, Dinker |date=20 July 2009}}</ref> In other communities, marriage within the gotra of the mother's father, and possibly some others, is prohibited.\n\nA possible workaround for sagotra marriages is to perform a 'Dathu' (adoption) of the bride to a family of different gotra (usually dathu is given to the bride's maternal uncle who belongs to different gotra by the same rule) and let them perform the '[[Kanyadan]]am' ('kanya' (girl) + 'danam' (to give)). Such workarounds are used in rare cases, and the acceptability is questionable.\n\nThe [[Vedic Hinduism]] recognises eight types of marriages, thus predominantly follows the principles as stated in the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manu-smriti Manu Smriti], referring to 8 types of marriages, the roles and responsibilities of husband and wife and the purpose of marriage. [[Hindu Marriage|Eight types of marriages]] are, (1) Brahma Vivaha, (2) Arsa Vivaha, (3) Daiva Vivaha, (4) Prajapatya Vivaha, (5) [[Gandharva marriage|Gandharva Vivaha]], (6) Asura Vivaha, (7) Rakshasa Vivaha, and (8) Paishacha Vivaha. The first four types of marriages reflect the paradigm behind arranged marriages. The last three are prohibited as per [[Manu Smriti]], out of which the last two are condemned. The Gandharva marriage is an analogy to the modern day love marriages, where the individuals have the liberty to choose their partners. Though [[Gandharva marriage]] had its due prominence in our Shahstras, but with advancement of time, [[Vedic Hinduism]] giving way to classic Hinduism, the concept of arranged marriage rose to prominence, which till today is predominant [[ritual]] for a marriage between two individuals.\n\nThe Gotra system had significant contribution in preventing genetic abnormalities since its inception thousands of years ago. However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after seventh generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/ Manu Smriti]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf The Hindu Marriage Act 1955]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra.

However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after seventh generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/ Manu Smriti]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf The Hindu Marriage Act 1955]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra. Even if it is known, there is hardly any way to prove its authenticity. <ref>[https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-June/027680.html advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-June/027680]</ref> Under current situation, it is impractical to follow the principles of restrictions on sagotra marriage but legal provision under Hindu Marriage Act are more appropriate to refrain from Sapinda marriage. \n\n===Legal situation===\nWhile the gotras are almost universally used for determining excluding marriages that would be traditionally [[incest]]uous, they are not legally recognized as such, although those within \"degrees of prohibited relationship\" or are  \"sapinda\" are not permitted to marry.<ref>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/vitalstatkb/Attachment546.aspx THE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955].</ref> [[Khap]] panchayats in Haryana have campaigned to legally ban marriages within the same gotra. A convener of the Kadyan Khap, Naresh Kadyan, petitioned the courts to seek amendment to the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] to legally prohibit such marriages. However, the petition was dismissed as withdrawn after being vacated, with the Delhi High Court warning that the Khap would face heavy penalty costs for wasting the time of the court.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/article472462.ece HC throws out plea to forbid same gotra marriages], ''The Hindu'', June 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 court case of ''Madhavrao vs Raghavendrarao'', which involved a [[Deshastha Brahmin]] couple, the definition of gotra as descending from eight sages and then branching out to several families was thrown out by the Bombay High Court. The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \"impossible to accept.\" The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times, emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of the Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is a near-impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-paradox-of-the-21st-century/article432445.ece|title=The paradox of the 21st century|author=Anand, Pinky |work=The Hindu|date=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aliyasantana]]\n* [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar]]\n* [[Pravaras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ruegg, D.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient.

It is metabolized in the body to the active [[coenzyme]] forms.<ref name=lpi/> Bacteria are used in commercial production process to synthesize hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin which are then converted to cyanocobalamin by exposure to cyanide (-CN).<ref name=Fang2017/>  \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub>, commonly encountered in pharmacology. It is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. Because it is water soluble it is used for intramuscular or intravenous injection. Hydroxocobalamin is used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, it has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.<ref name=ObeidFedosov />\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref name=Wick1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

The culture medium for LLD required liver extract. Shorb knew that the same liver extract was used to treat pernicious anemia (her father-in-law had died from the disease), and concluded that LLD could be developed as an assay method to identify the active compound. While at the University of Maryland she received a small grant from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and in collaboration with [[Karl Folkers]] from that company, developed the LLD assay. This identified \"LLD factor\" as essential for the bacteria's growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|title=Mary Shorb Lecture in Nutrition|access-date=March 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085215/https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shorb, Folker and  [[Alexander R.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

It is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. Because it is water soluble it is used for intramuscular or intravenous injection. Hydroxocobalamin is used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, it has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.<ref name=ObeidFedosov />\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]].

He worked for a firm that made [[telegraph]] equipment for the Swedish government agency [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]]. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend [[Carl Johan Andersson]] in central [[Stockholm]] and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nAlso in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. He bought a number of [[Siemens]] telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]] and [[Swedish State Railways]]. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as [[Rikstelefon]] to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or [[Royalties|royalty]] problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year, he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nEricsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to [[Scandinavia]]. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of [[brass]], [[wire]], [[ebonite]], and [[magnet]] steel. Much of the [[walnut]] wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.\n\nStockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other [[Nordic countries]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into ''Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beckman|first=Bengt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPgrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=Allm%C3%A4nna+Telefonaktiebolaget+LM+Ericsson&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihoZWciPfnAhWqknIEHf30DYwQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=Allm%C3%A4nna%20Telefonaktiebolaget%20LM%20Ericsson&f=false|title=Swedish Signal Intelligence 1900-1945|last2=McKay|first2=C. G.|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34148-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1884, a multiple-[[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] manual [[telephone exchange]] was mostly copied from a design by C.&nbsp;E. Scribner at [[Western Electric]]. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held [[patent]] 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather \"inspiration\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn 1884, a technician named Anton Av\u00e9n at ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''The [[Telephone magneto|Dachshund]]''.\n\n===International expansion===\n[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg|thumb|upright|An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of [[Nottingham]], England, it is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].]]\n\nAs production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK ([[Ericsson Telephones Ltd.]]) and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the [[National Telephone Company]] was a major customer; by 1897 sold 28% of its output in the UK. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nOther countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. [[Mass production]] techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Bobs%20phones/Pages/SwedEricsson/EricssonCradles.htm |title=Ericsson Cradles |website=Bobs Phones Page |accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, [[KBR (company)|Kellogg]] and [[Automatic Electric]] dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.\n\n===Automatic equipment===\n[[File:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg|thumb|LM Ericsson's former headquarters at [[Telefonplan]] in Stockholm, see LM Ericsson building]]\n\nEricsson ignored the growth of [[automatic telephony]] in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" /> [[World War I]], the subsequent [[Great Depression]], and the loss of its Russian assets after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]] slowed the company's development while sales to other countries fell by about half.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/company/the-consequences-of-expansion/ericsson-and-the-great-depression|title=1931|date=2016-08-30|website=Ericsson.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>\n\n===Shareholding changes===\nThe acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by [[Ivar Kreuger]], an international financier. The company was renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nIn 1928, Ericsson began issuing \"A\" and \"B\" shares; an \"A\" share had 1000 votes against a \"B\" share.  Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few \"A\" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of \"B\" shares while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1930, the second issue of \"B\"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].  He then took a loan for his own company [[Kreuger & Toll]] from [[ITT Corporation]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEricsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11&nbsp;million{{clarify|reason=which currency?|date=January 2016}} on the deal.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nKreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he was unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT cancelled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11&nbsp;million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT owned one-third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Wallenberg era begins===\nEricsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]] (now [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]]) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]], and some Swedish government backing. [[Marcus Wallenberg Jr.]] negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson \"A\" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family bought ITT\u2018s shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\n===Market development===\n[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.]]\n[[File:Ericsson 1950s bakelite telephone.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan]]\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one-third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nNegotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and [[switchgear]]. The [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSales drives resumed after the [[Great Depression]], but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Further development===\nEricsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, [[MTD (mobile network)#MTA|MTA]], in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/19883.php |title=Ericsson Celebrates 50 Years of Mobile Telephony |website=Cellular-news.com |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s.

CEO Lars Ramqvist wrote in the 1996 annual report that in all three of its business areas \u2013 Mobile Telephones and Terminals, Mobile Systems, and Infocom Systems \u2013 \"we will expand our operations as they relate to customer service and Internet Protocol (IP) access (Internet and intranet access)\".<ref name=\"ericsson.com\">{{cite web|title=Annual Report 1996|website=Ericsson|url=https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/investors/documents/financial-reports-and-filings/annual-reports/annualreport1996_en.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ericsson mobil.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An [[Ericsson GH337]] (1995) and [[Ericsson T28]] (1999) mobile phones]]\nThe growth of [[GSM]], which became a ''de facto'' world standard, combined with Ericsson's other mobile standards, such as [[D-AMPS]] and [[Personal Digital Cellular|PDC]], meant that by the start of 1997, Ericsson had an estimated 40% share of the world's mobile market, with around 54 million subscribers. There were also around 188&nbsp;million [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE]] lines in place or on order in 117 countries.<ref name=\"ericsson.com\" /> Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as [[GPRS]] (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a [[3G]] mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the [[WCDMA]] (wideband [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards.

He worked for a firm that made [[telegraph]] equipment for the Swedish government agency [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]]. In 1876, at the age of 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend [[Carl Johan Andersson]] in central [[Stockholm]] and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His telephones were not technically innovative. In 1878 he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecommunications operating company, Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nAlso in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the [[Bell Telephone Company]]. He bought a number of [[Siemens]] telephones and analyzed the technology; Ericsson had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier. He was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones through his firm's repair work for [[Televerket (Sweden)|Telegrafverket]] and [[Swedish State Railways]]. He improved these designs to produce a higher-quality instrument to be used by new telephone companies such as [[Rikstelefon]] to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. Ericsson had no patent or [[Royalties|royalty]] problems because Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the standard of finish and the ornate design of Ericsson telephones of this period. At the end of the year, he started to manufacture telephones much like those of Siemens; the first product was finished in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nEricsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to [[Scandinavia]]. Its factory could not keep up with demand; joinery and metal-plating were contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported; in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of [[brass]], [[wire]], [[ebonite]], and [[magnet]] steel. Much of the [[walnut]] wood used for cabinets was imported from the United States.\n\nStockholm's telephone network expanded that year and the company reformed into a telephone manufacturer. When Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. Ericsson's equipment was sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in other [[Nordic countries]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company called ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' in 1883. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into ''Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beckman|first=Bengt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPgrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=Allm%C3%A4nna+Telefonaktiebolaget+LM+Ericsson&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihoZWciPfnAhWqknIEHf30DYwQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=Allm%C3%A4nna%20Telefonaktiebolaget%20LM%20Ericsson&f=false|title=Swedish Signal Intelligence 1900-1945|last2=McKay|first2=C. G.|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34148-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1884, a multiple-[[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] manual [[telephone exchange]] was mostly copied from a design by C.&nbsp;E. Scribner at [[Western Electric]]. This was legal because the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the United States it had held [[patent]] 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the United States, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather \"inspiration\".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They found U.S. switchboard designs were more advanced but Ericsson telephones were equal to others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn 1884, a technician named Anton Av\u00e9n at ''Stockholms Allm\u00e4nna Telefonaktiebolag'' combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges where operators needed to have one hand free when talking to customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named ''The [[Telephone magneto|Dachshund]]''.\n\n===International expansion===\n[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1961S01536.00001(1).jpg|thumb|upright|An early, wooden, Ericsson telephone, made by the Ericsson Telephone Co. Ltd., of [[Nottingham]], England, it is now in the collection of [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]].]]\n\nAs production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson expanded into foreign markets through a number of agents. The UK ([[Ericsson Telephones Ltd.]]) and Russia were early markets, where factories were later established improve the chances of gaining local contracts and to augment the output of the Swedish factory. In the UK, the [[National Telephone Company]] was a major customer; by 1897 sold 28% of its output in the UK. The Nordic countries were also Ericsson customers; they were encouraged by the growth of telephone services in Sweden.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nOther countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European markets. [[Mass production]] techniques now firmly established; telephones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollecting.org/Bobs%20phones/Pages/SwedEricsson/EricssonCradles.htm |title=Ericsson Cradles |website=Bobs Phones Page |accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDespite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group, [[KBR (company)|Kellogg]] and [[Automatic Electric]] dominated the market. Ericsson eventually sold its U.S. assets. Sales in Mexico led to inroads into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.\n\n===Automatic equipment===\n[[File:Ericsson telefonplan 20050902 001.jpg|thumb|LM Ericsson's former headquarters at [[Telefonplan]] in Stockholm, see LM Ericsson building]]\n\nEricsson ignored the growth of [[automatic telephony]] in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" /> [[World War I]], the subsequent [[Great Depression]], and the loss of its Russian assets after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolution]] slowed the company's development while sales to other countries fell by about half.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/company/the-consequences-of-expansion/ericsson-and-the-great-depression|title=1931|date=2016-08-30|website=Ericsson.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>\n\n===Shareholding changes===\nThe acquisition of other telecommunications companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances; in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring most of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by [[Ivar Kreuger]], an international financier. The company was renamed ''Telefon AB LM Ericsson''. Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nIn 1928, Ericsson began issuing \"A\" and \"B\" shares; an \"A\" share had 1000 votes against a \"B\" share.  Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few \"A\" shares, not a majority of the shares. The company raised more money by issuing a lot of \"B\" shares while maintaining the ''status quo'' of power distribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1930, the second issue of \"B\"-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" shares he bought with money lent by LM Ericsson, with [[collateral (finance)|security]] given in German state [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].  He then took a loan for his own company [[Kreuger & Toll]] from [[ITT Corporation]] (administered by [[Sosthenes Behn]]), giving parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of international financial dealings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nEricsson was now regarded by ITT as a takeover target as its main international competitor. In 1931, ITT acquired enough shares from Kreuger to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time because of a government-imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Kreuger in return gained shares in ITT; he stood to make a profit of $11&nbsp;million{{clarify|reason=which currency?|date=January 2016}} on the deal.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger & Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nKreuger had been using the company as security for loans; despite his profits he was unable to repay them. Ericsson found they had invested in some doubtful share deals, whose losses were deemed significant. ITT examined the deal and found it had been misled about Ericsson's value.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT asked Kreuger to go to New York City for a conference, but he did not attend. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, the banking institutions pressured him to provide security for his loans.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT cancelled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11&nbsp;million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} ITT owned one-third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the company's articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Wallenberg era begins===\nEricsson was saved from bankruptcy and closure with the help of banks including [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]] (now [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]]) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the [[Wallenberg family]], and some Swedish government backing. [[Marcus Wallenberg Jr.]] negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. The banks gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson \"A\" shares, while ITT was still the largest shareholder. In 1960, the Wallenberg family bought ITT\u2018s shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\n===Market development===\n[[File:Ericsson bakelittelefon 1931 sv.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH1001 (1931) was the first combined telephone set with a housing and handset made from Bakelite. The design is attributed to Jean Heiberg.]]\n[[File:Ericsson 1950s bakelite telephone.jpg|thumb|The Ericsson DBH15 telephone, a successor of the DBH 1001 and redesigned in 1947 by Gerard Kiljan]]\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems serviced by small, private companies that had evolved were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson obtained some leases, which represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. Ericsson got almost one-third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.<ref name=\"BizHistory\" />\n\nNegotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The size of ITT made it hard to compete with. Ericsson reduced its involvement in telephone operating companies and went back to manufacturing telephones and [[switchgear]]. The [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]] factory in the UK had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The factory built automatic switching equipment for the GPO under license from Strowger, and exported products to former UK colonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The UK government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in the UK allowed it to get most of the contracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSales drives resumed after the [[Great Depression]], but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. It still produced a range of telephones and switching equipment; the latter was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles became subdued by the increasing use of bakelite telephones starting in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Further development===\nEricsson introduced the world's first fully automatic mobile telephone system, [[MTD (mobile network)#MTA|MTA]], in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/19883.php |title=Ericsson Celebrates 50 Years of Mobile Telephony |website=Cellular-news.com |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It released one of the world's first hands-free speaker telephones in the 1960s.

There were also around 188&nbsp;million [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE]] lines in place or on order in 117 countries.<ref name=\"ericsson.com\" /> Telecom and chip companies worked in the 1990s to provide Internet access over mobile telephones. Early versions such as [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) used packet data over the existing GSM network, in a form known as [[GPRS]] (General Packet Radio Service), but these services, known as 2.5G, were fairly rudimentary and did not achieve much mass-market success.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) had prepared the specifications for a [[3G]] mobile service that included several technologies. Ericsson pushed hard for the [[WCDMA]] (wideband [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]]) form based on the GSM standard, and began testing it in 1996. Japanese operator [[NTT DoCoMo]] signed deals to partner with Ericsson and Nokia, who came together in 1997 to support WCDMA over rival standards. DoCoMo was the first operator with a live 3G network, using its own version of WCDMA called [[FOMA]]. Ericsson was a significant developer of the WCDMA version of GSM, while US-based chip developer [[Qualcomm]] promoted the alternative system [[CDMA2000]], building on the popularity of CDMA in the US market. This resulted in a patent infringement lawsuit that was resolved in March 1999<ref>{{cite web|title=Ericsson/Qualcomm bitter feud ends|date=29 March 1999|first=Nancy|last=Gohring|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud/|website=Connected Planet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040128/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_ericssonqualcomm_bitter_feud|archivedate=9 January 2014}}</ref> when the two companies agreed to pay each other royalties for the use of their respective technologies and Ericsson purchased Qualcomm's wireless infrastructure business and some R&D resources.<ref>{{cite news|title=Short Take: Qualcomm, Ericsson finalize CDMA agreement |url=http://news.cnet.com/Short-Take-Qualcomm,-Ericsson-finalize-CDMA-agreement/2110-1033_3-226260.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018160816/https://www.cnet.com/news/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-10-18 |work=[[CNET]] }}</ref>\n\nOnce the Qualcomm conflict was settled, Ericsson continued to be involved in mobile Internet.

Knowing the impact of plastics on the environment, both on land and in the oceans (and specifically the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]) Ericsson team in India was keen to find a new approach to providing clean drinking water to their staff. They reviewed the volumes, counted the cost, considered the environmental impact, and then identified a solution \u2013 a simple and straightforward water filtration process called reverse osmosis (RO).\nThe company identified a total of 21 suitable locations (the remaining four were too small to be cost efficient) and in February they installed 150 free-standing RO free systems, thereby removing approximately 25,000 plastic bottles a month from circulation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ashworth |first1=Tony |title=Reducing plastic waste in India |url=https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/sustainability_corporateresponsibility/technology-for-good-blog/2018/05/15/reducing-plastic-waste-in-india/ |website=Ericsson.com |accessdate=29 August 2018 |ref=https://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/sustainability_corporateresponsibility/technology-for-good-blog/author/tony-ashworth/}}</ref>\n\n==Research and development==\nEricsson has structured its R&D in three levels depending on when products or technologies will be introduced to customers and users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/technology_insights |title=Technology and Research Insights |accessdate=2016-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101000410/http://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/technology_insights |archivedate=1 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2019}} Its research and development organization is part of 'Group Function Technology' and addresses several facets of network architecture: wireless access networks; radio access technologies; broadband technologies; packet technologies; multimedia technologies; services software; EMF safety and sustainability; security; and global services.<ref name=\"research\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/company_facts/research |title=Our Research Areas |publisher=Ericsson |date= |accessdate=2016-11-11}}</ref> The head of research since 2012 is [[Sara Mazur]].<ref>[http://www.ericsson.com/news/1652330 New Head of Ericsson Research appointed].

Over time people made different kinds of Goldendoodles. A male Poodle bred with a female Golden Retriever produces an F1 Goldendoodle. A male Poodle bred with an F1 Goldendoodle is called an F1B (F1-back cross). F2 Goldendoodles are male Goldendoodles bred with female Goldendoodles.

There is the straight coat, which is flat and resembles more of a golden retriever coat. The wavy coat type is a mixture of a poodle's curls, and a golden retriever's straighter coat. The last coat type is curly, which tends to look more like the poodle coat. A goldendoodle's size is generally somewhere between that of its poodle parent and golden retriever parent. The ranges of size include standard, medium, and miniature (if the poodle parent was miniature). Upon reaching adulthood, a standard goldendoodle will often weigh 60 to 100 pounds. A medium goldendoodle will weigh between 30 and 45 pounds and a miniature goldendoodle will weigh approximately 15 to 30 pounds. The standard in height at the shoulder for a male goldendoodle is about 24-26 inches. For females, it is 22-23 inches. Often, taller goldendoodles inherit more from the golden retriever and will weigh substantially more. It is very common for the goldendoodle to inherit the \"golden retriever bump\" on top of his/her head.<ref name=\"faq\" /><ref>{{cite book| last=MacKenzie| first=Edie| year=2009| title= Goldendoodles: Complete Pet Owner's Manual| publisher=Barron's Educational Series, Inc| isbn=0-7641-4290-9}}</ref> \n\nCommon coat colors include white, cream, apricot, gold, red, and sometimes gray and black (also called phantom).

However, some major kennel clubs do accept registration of crossbreed and mixed-breed dogs for performance events such as agility and obedience such as the [https://ckcusa.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtf_tBRDtARIsAIbAKe0Uj2I2O2N-E_PuU3lgOic9mbgoseCtzqn5XXFg76vsX-5725U4w5gaAjz6EALw_wcB Continental Kennel Club]. The Continental Kennel Club will accept and grant a pedigree on a goldendoodle as long as the parents have registration.[[File:3100489919 06e44ec1da Goldendoodles.jpg|thumb|Golden retriever with her litter of 13 goldendoodle puppies]]The F generational designation provides understanding of a dogs linage and how much golden retriever or poodle is in the mix.  An F1 (first generation) is the direct offspring of a golden retriever and a poodle giving 50% golden retriever and 50% poodle mix.  An F2 (second generation) is the offspring of two F1 goldendoodles which also gives a 50% golden retriever and 50% poodle.   \n\nBreeders can produce a higher percentage of curly and soft coats found in the poodle by breeding an F1 goldendoodle back with a poodle which is known as backcrossing.  This is a F1B goldendoodle which is 25% golden retriever and 75% poodle.  An F2 goldendoodle can be bred back with a poodle giving F2B offspring that are 25% golden retriever and 75% poodle.  Alternatively, F2B can refer to the offsprings of an F1B parent with an F1 parent, resulting in 37.5% golden retriever and 62.5% poodle.\nBreeders can also produce small goldendoodles by breeding a miniature poodle with a miniature goldendoodle (a mix of a full sized golden retriever and a miniature poodle).  These F1B goldendoodles weigh between 15-25 pounds.\n[[File:Sansa 5.jpg|thumb|right|F1B Miniature Golden Doodle]]\n\nF3 generation usually is a catch-all for anything beyond the F2 with or without the \"B\" backcross indicator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ckcusa.com/blog/2017/april/canine-crash-course-f1-f2-f3-and-multi-generational-designations/|title=CANINE CRASH COURSE: F1, F2, F3, AND MULTI-GENERATIONAL DESIGNATIONS|last=Demars|first=Crystal|date=April 6, 2017|website=CKC USA}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Generation Designations\n!Offspring\n!Parent 1\n!Parent 2\n!% Golden\n!% Poodle\n|-\n|F1\n|Golden Retriever\n|Poodle\n|50\n|50\n|-\n|F2\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|50\n|50\n|-\n|F1B\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|Poodle\n|25\n|75\n|-\n|F2B\n|F1B Goldendoodle\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|37.5\n|62.5\n|-\n|F2B\n|F2 Goldendoodle\n|Poodle\n|25\n|75\n|}\n[[File:Twelve-week old goldendoodle pup.JPG|thumb|Twelve-week-old Goldendoodle puppy]]Some breeders prefer to restrict breeding to the first generation (F1) and first generation cross-back (F1B).<ref name=\"gen\"/> This is done in an attempt to maximize genetic diversity and avoid the inherited health problems that have plagued many dog breeds.<ref name=\"Cake\">{{cite web| url=http://www.canine-genetics.com/cake.htm| title=The Poodle and the Chocolate Cake| author=John Armstrong |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |publisher=The Canine Diversity Project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105154529/http://www.canine-genetics.com/cake.htm |archivedate=5 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nWith knowledgeable breeding, the goldendoodle tends to be a rather healthy dog, but Poodles and Golden Retrievers are both susceptible to [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Therefore, an [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] or [[PennHIP]] exam is highly recommended to check for this problem before dogs are bred.

A male Poodle bred with an F1 Goldendoodle is called an F1B (F1-back cross). F2 Goldendoodles are male Goldendoodles bred with female Goldendoodles. There are three types of Poodles; Standard, Miniature and Toy, meaning Goldendoodles come in all sizes. \n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:2770692200812301939581Goldendoodle pup 7 weeks old.jpg|thumb|Goldendoodle puppy at 6 weeks old--the coat starts out quite flat and becomes more curly as the puppy grows older]]\n===Shedding===\nAlthough not all goldendoodles exhibit the [[Hypoallergenic dog breed|hypoallergenic]] coat type of the [[Standard Poodle]], most goldendoodles do have a low to non-shedding coat.<ref name=\"faq\" /> While the degree of shedding varies from dog to dog, overall, the goldendoodle exhibits less shedding than other dogs.

There is the straight coat, which is flat and resembles more of a golden retriever coat. The wavy coat type is a mixture of a poodle's curls, and a golden retriever's straighter coat. The last coat type is curly, which tends to look more like the poodle coat. A goldendoodle's size is generally somewhere between that of its poodle parent and golden retriever parent. The ranges of size include standard, medium, and miniature (if the poodle parent was miniature). Upon reaching adulthood, a standard goldendoodle will often weigh 60 to 100 pounds. A medium goldendoodle will weigh between 30 and 45 pounds and a miniature goldendoodle will weigh approximately 15 to 30 pounds. The standard in height at the shoulder for a male goldendoodle is about 24-26 inches. For females, it is 22-23 inches. Often, taller goldendoodles inherit more from the golden retriever and will weigh substantially more. It is very common for the goldendoodle to inherit the \"golden retriever bump\" on top of his/her head.<ref name=\"faq\" /><ref>{{cite book| last=MacKenzie| first=Edie| year=2009| title= Goldendoodles: Complete Pet Owner's Manual| publisher=Barron's Educational Series, Inc| isbn=0-7641-4290-9}}</ref> \n\nCommon coat colors include white, cream, apricot, gold, red, and sometimes gray and black (also called phantom).

The Continental Kennel Club will accept and grant a pedigree on a goldendoodle as long as the parents have registration.[[File:3100489919 06e44ec1da Goldendoodles.jpg|thumb|Golden retriever with her litter of 13 goldendoodle puppies]]The F generational designation provides understanding of a dogs linage and how much golden retriever or poodle is in the mix.  An F1 (first generation) is the direct offspring of a golden retriever and a poodle giving 50% golden retriever and 50% poodle mix.  An F2 (second generation) is the offspring of two F1 goldendoodles which also gives a 50% golden retriever and 50% poodle.   \n\nBreeders can produce a higher percentage of curly and soft coats found in the poodle by breeding an F1 goldendoodle back with a poodle which is known as backcrossing.  This is a F1B goldendoodle which is 25% golden retriever and 75% poodle.  An F2 goldendoodle can be bred back with a poodle giving F2B offspring that are 25% golden retriever and 75% poodle.  Alternatively, F2B can refer to the offsprings of an F1B parent with an F1 parent, resulting in 37.5% golden retriever and 62.5% poodle.\nBreeders can also produce small goldendoodles by breeding a miniature poodle with a miniature goldendoodle (a mix of a full sized golden retriever and a miniature poodle).  These F1B goldendoodles weigh between 15-25 pounds.\n[[File:Sansa 5.jpg|thumb|right|F1B Miniature Golden Doodle]]\n\nF3 generation usually is a catch-all for anything beyond the F2 with or without the \"B\" backcross indicator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ckcusa.com/blog/2017/april/canine-crash-course-f1-f2-f3-and-multi-generational-designations/|title=CANINE CRASH COURSE: F1, F2, F3, AND MULTI-GENERATIONAL DESIGNATIONS|last=Demars|first=Crystal|date=April 6, 2017|website=CKC USA}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Generation Designations\n!Offspring\n!Parent 1\n!Parent 2\n!% Golden\n!% Poodle\n|-\n|F1\n|Golden Retriever\n|Poodle\n|50\n|50\n|-\n|F2\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|50\n|50\n|-\n|F1B\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|Poodle\n|25\n|75\n|-\n|F2B\n|F1B Goldendoodle\n|F1 Goldendoodle\n|37.5\n|62.5\n|-\n|F2B\n|F2 Goldendoodle\n|Poodle\n|25\n|75\n|}\n[[File:Twelve-week old goldendoodle pup.JPG|thumb|Twelve-week-old Goldendoodle puppy]]Some breeders prefer to restrict breeding to the first generation (F1) and first generation cross-back (F1B).<ref name=\"gen\"/> This is done in an attempt to maximize genetic diversity and avoid the inherited health problems that have plagued many dog breeds.<ref name=\"Cake\">{{cite web| url=http://www.canine-genetics.com/cake.htm| title=The Poodle and the Chocolate Cake| author=John Armstrong |year=2001 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |publisher=The Canine Diversity Project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105154529/http://www.canine-genetics.com/cake.htm |archivedate=5 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nWith knowledgeable breeding, the goldendoodle tends to be a rather healthy dog, but Poodles and Golden Retrievers are both susceptible to [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Therefore, an [[Orthopedic Foundation for Animals|OFA]] or [[PennHIP]] exam is highly recommended to check for this problem before dogs are bred.

After only eighteen months of service, she was lost in a hurricane on the North Atlantic, with most of her crew rescued through a daring maneuver carried out by the ship ''Excelsior''.\n\nBuilt for South American service, ''Tejuca'' spent most of her brief career in the coffee trade between Brazil and the United States, making four round trips between the two countries, including a passage between [[Bahia]] and [[New Orleans]] in early 1855 that at the time was reportedly one of the fastest on record. \n\nIn late December 1855, ''Tejuca'' embarked on her first [[transatlantic crossing]], and a few days later ran into a severe hurricane. With the ship badly damaged and in a sinking condition, all but one of her crew were rescued by the ship ''Excelsior'', whose captain risked his own vessel by bringing it alongside ''Tejuca'' while the storm still raged.

This coincides with the Calvinist [[synods of Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w]] 1550&ndash;1564.\n\nLord [[Nicholas Ole\u015bnicki]] inherited the [[Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w]] estate in 1546. He was influenced by his wife [[Zofia Ole\u015bnicka]], and his father in law, to Calvinism. First [[Andreas Osiander]] and then the Italian ex-priest [[Francesco Stancaro]], two Calvinist professors at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], preached in Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w.\n\nStancaro moved Olesnicki to drive out the monks and convert the monastic church at Pinczow to Calvinist rite November 25, 1550. Then from 1551 founded the Academy.\n\n==Teaching staff==\nThe first rector was Grzegorz Orszak of the University of Krak\u00f3w. In 1556 Calvin sent [[Pierre Statorius]] to be the new rector, in addition to teaching Latin and Greek.

This coincides with the Calvinist [[synods of Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w]] 1550&ndash;1564.\n\nLord [[Nicholas Ole\u015bnicki]] inherited the [[Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w]] estate in 1546. He was influenced by his wife [[Zofia Ole\u015bnicka]], and his father in law, to Calvinism. First [[Andreas Osiander]] and then the Italian ex-priest [[Francesco Stancaro]], two Calvinist professors at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], preached in Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w.\n\nStancaro moved Olesnicki to drive out the monks and convert the monastic church at Pinczow to Calvinist rite November 25, 1550. Then from 1551 founded the Academy.\n\n==Teaching staff==\nThe first rector was Grzegorz Orszak of the University of Krak\u00f3w. In 1556 Calvin sent [[Pierre Statorius]] to be the new rector, in addition to teaching Latin and Greek. Other teachers included [[Francesco Lismanino]], [[Georg Schomann]] and [[Jean Thenaud]].\n\n==Alumni==\nStudents included\n* Justus Rabb (d. 1612) - Jesuit theologian\n* Aleksy Rodecki (d.1606) - printer in Rakow\n* Krzysztof Przechadzka - later a teacher at the academy.\n* Stanis\u0142aw Cikowski (d.1617) - chamberlain of Krak\u00f3w\n* Remigiusz Che\u0142mski - antitrinitarian\n\nThe school was forced to close temporarily 1565.
