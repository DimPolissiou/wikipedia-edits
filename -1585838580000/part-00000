A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and [[English overseas possessions|England]] and later [[British Empire|Great Britain]]. France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The north american holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic.

A few years later, in 1608, [[Samuel De Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]], which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of [[New France]] (also called Canada).<ref>Marcel Trudel, ''The Beginnings of New France, 1524\u20131663'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1973).</ref>\n\nNew France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]].

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

These were restored at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France's repurchase of Louisiana in 1800 came to nothing, as the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]] convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to [[Louisiana Purchase|its sale]] to the United States in 1803. The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798\u20131801 was not successful.

The [[Franco-Tahitian War]] broke out between the [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] people and the French from 1844 to 1847 as France attempted to consolidate their rule and extend their rule into the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]] where Queen P\u014dmare sought refuge with her relatives. The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen P\u014dmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]] or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen P\u014dmare's allies in Leeward Islands.

He joined Britain in sending an army to China during [[Second Opium War]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1860), but French ventures to establish influence in [[Japan]] (1867) and [[Korea]] (1866) were less successful. His attempt to impose a European monarch, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure in 1867. To restore the Mexican Republic, 31,962 Mexicans died violently, including over 11,000 executed by firing squads, 8,304 were seriously wounded and 33,281 endured captivity in prisoner of war camps. Those Mexicans who fought for the monarchy sacrificed 5,671 of their number killed in combat, 2,159 badly wounded, and 4,379 taken prisoner.

A key part of the enterprise was the modernization of the French Navy; he began the construction of fifteen powerful new battle cruisers powered by steam and driven by propellers; and a fleet of steam powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain's. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, [[Zouaves]], the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico. By the end of Napoleon III's reign the French overseas territories had tripled in area; in 1870 they covered a million square kilometers, with more than five million inhabitants.<ref>Pierre Milza, ''Napol\u00e9on III'' (in French, Paris:  2006), pp. 626\u2013636</ref>\n\n===New Caledonia becomes a French possession (1853\u201354)===\nOn 24 September 1853, Admiral [[Auguste Febvrier Despointes|Febvrier Despointes]] took formal possession of [[New Caledonia]] and [[Port-de-France]] (Noum\u00e9a) was founded 25 June 1854.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.<ref>G.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered. There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M.

Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

Anti-French factions in the kingdom of [[Huahine]] also attempted to fight off the French under Queen [[Teuhe]] while the kingdom of [[Bora Bora]] remained neutral but hostile to the French.

The refusal of [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], the US-supported president of the first Republic of Vietnam [RVN], to allow elections in 1956, as had been stipulated by the Geneva Conference, eventually led to the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nIn France's African colonies, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]]'s insurrection, which started in 1955 and headed by [[Ruben Um Nyob\u00e9]], was violently repressed over a two-year period, with perhaps as many as 100 people killed. However, France formally relinquished its protectorate over [[Morocco]] and granted it independence in 1956.\n\nFrench involvement in [[Algeria]] stretched back a century. The movements of [[Ferhat Abbas]] and [[Messali Hadj]] had marked the period between the two world wars, but both sides radicalised after the Second World War. In 1945, the [[S\u00e9tif massacre]] was carried out by the French army.  The [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian War]] started in 1954.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters. Foccart supported in particular the [[Nigerian Civil War]] during the late 1960s.<ref>Dorothy Shipley White, ''Black Africa and de Gaulle: From the French Empire to Independence'' (1979).</ref>\n\nRobert Aldrich argues that with Algerian independence in 1962, it appeared that the Empire practically had come to an end, as the remaining colonies were quite small and lacked active nationalist movements. However, there was trouble in French Somaliland ([[Djibouti]]), which became independent in 1977. There also were complications and delays in the New Hebrides [[Vanuatu]], which was the last to gain independence in 1980.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of [[New France]].

A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and [[English overseas possessions|Kingdom of Britain]] . France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The north american holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394&nbsp;km\u00b2 (46,098 sq. miles),  with 2.7 million people in 2013.

A few years later, in 1608, [[Samuel De Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]], which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of [[New France]] (also called Canada).<ref>Marcel Trudel, ''The Beginnings of New France, 1524\u20131663'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1973).</ref>\n\nNew France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]]. The extensive trading network throughout the region connected to Canada through the [[Great Lakes]], was maintained through a vast system of fortifications, many of them centred in the [[Illinois Country]] and in present-day Arkansas.<ref>Carl J.

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

These were restored at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France's repurchase of Louisiana in 1800 came to nothing, as the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]] convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to [[Louisiana Purchase|its sale]] to the United States in 1803. The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798\u20131801 was not successful.

The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen P\u014dmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]] or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen P\u014dmare's allies in Leeward Islands.

His attempt to impose a European monarch, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure in 1867. To restore the Mexican Republic, 31,962 Mexicans died violently, including over 11,000 executed by firing squads, 8,304 were seriously wounded and 33,281 endured captivity in prisoner of war camps.

The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain's. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, [[Zouaves]], the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered.

Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M.

Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

However, control was gradually reestablished by [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The [[French Union]], included in the [[French Constitution of 1946|Constitution of 1946]], nominally replaced the former colonial empire, but officials in Paris remained in full control. The colonies were given local assemblies with only limited local power and budgets.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population.

The series was created by [[Jonathan Schmock]] and [[Jim Vallely]], and produced by [[Witt/Thomas Productions]] in association with [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]] (season 1) and [[Walt Disney Television]] (season 2). The primary focus of the series is on the relationship of three brothers, played by real-life brothers [[Joey Lawrence]], [[Matthew Lawrence]], and [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{inuniverse|section|date=January 2020}}\n===Main===\n* Joseph \"Joe\" Roman (played by [[Joey Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is the oldest of the three brothers. He is a half-brother to Matt and Andy. Claire is his stepmother. He is vain, cocky and arrogant at times, and thinks highly of himself, though he is a good person at heart.  He is constantly fighting for the affection of Lou Davis. His brothers really look up to him as a role model and as a father-figure. He was born on November 10, 1975 as revealed in the episode \"Once Around The Block\" making him 20 years old at the start of the series. Joe was 5 when his father left him and his mother. His father eventually re-married Claire. Together they had Matt and Andy. Joe's father later died in a racing accident. Joe's mother lives in California. Joe is an avid motorcycle fan and works as a mechanic.\n*Matthew \"Matt\" Roman (played by [[Matthew Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is 15\u201316 and is the middle child. He bows to peer pressure easily. He is also put down by his family with some of his doings as well. Matt was an absolute neat freak and germaphobe; at the age of one, he could change his own diaper, and he went through his entire childhood without ever catching the chickenpox. He loved washing the dishes and was known for other odd habits like making \"Matt water\", folding his socks. Unlike Joe and Andy, he never did well with girls. He has a crush on Kristin and is said in the episode, \"I scream, You scream\", that Matt is in love with Kristen.  He sang twice, once in an angel costume singing the last two bars of \"Silent Night\" (A Roman Holiday), the other (Art Attack) when he played his mother's guitar and sang a song called \"Pigeon On Your Car\" which was written by Matt Lawrence himself.\n*Andrew \"Andy\" Roman (played by [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is the youngest. He is seen wearing a variety of costumes (including [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Spider-Man]]). He is a bundle of mischief and has a vivid imagination. In one of the episodes, he is \"in love\" with Lou Davis, and writes her an email. Andy was only 5 when his father died in a racing accident.\n*Louise \"Lou\" Davis (played by [[Liz Vassey]]) \u2014 She is a female mechanic who is seen going out with different men in a few episodes.  She is an artist, even having crafted a ring for one of her suitors.  She is always making sarcastic remarks to Joe from what he says about her. In later episodes it is shown that she may have love interests in Joe Roman. Joe and Lou kiss under the mistletoe in an episode called, \"A Roman Holiday\" and in an episode, \"Other people\". Andy is said to be in love with her, and receives an email from him, signed, A Roman who loves you. She automatically believes it was Joe.\n*Claire Roman (played by [[Melinda Culea]]) \u2014 She is Joe's stepmother, and Matt and Andy's mother. She is a take charge kind of woman and sometimes thinks Joe is a bad influence on Matt and Andy. \n* Lloyd Burwell (played by [[Mike McShane]]) \u2014 A former Coast Guard for six years and mechanic. He is overweight and is sometimes needy, but under his gruff exterior lies a sensitive, intelligent man. He used to go by the alias \"The Masked Avenger\", an alias he used to play pranks on Mr. Hangarter, a cruel drivers' education teacher. Lloyd is known to be somewhat stupid and ignorant, but in some episodes has surprised everyone and shown to be very intelligent.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Kristin (played by [[Rebecca Herbst]]) \u2014 She used to attend house parties often, but now has cleaned up her act. She is one of Matt's best friends.  She used to have a crush on Joe. Matt has a crush on her, but she sees him more of a brother than a boyfriend. She was a badgirl and got drunk, but changed after she and Matt started hanging out.\n*Silent Jim (played by Karl David-Djerf) \u2014 He rarely speaks but when he does, Matt describes it as \"something special\".  Instead of speaking he usually communicates with a laugh.  He is a recurring cast member, although, he does not appear in many episodes. \n*Myrna Burwell (played by [[Estelle Getty]], seen only in season two's \"Motherly Love\") \u2014 She is Lloyd\u2019s mother who lives in a trailer, and is part of the reason why Lloyd is so needy. She can do cartwheels despite her age. She also teaches the mambo and is said to clip Lloyd's toenails.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Series overview ===\n{{Series overview\n\n| color1     = #FF5F5C\n| link1      = #Season 1 (1995\u201396)\n| episodes1  = 16\n| start1     = {{Start date|1995|9|16}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1996|4|1}}\n\n| color2     = #9400B6\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1996\u201397)\n| episodes2  = 24\n| start2     = {{Start date|1996|9|15}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1997|5|18}}\n\n}}\n\n=== Season 1 (1995\u201396) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FF5F5C |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{ Episode list \n | EpisodeNumber=1\n | EpisodeNumber2=1 \n | Title=Pilot\n | DirectedBy=[[Terry Hughes (director)|Terry Hughes]]\n | WrittenBy=[[Jim Vallely]] & [[Jonathan Schmock]] \n | OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|9|16}}\n | ProdCode=001\n | ShortSummary= Joe's parents are divorced and he moves away with his mom and his dad starts a new life with his new wife Claire.

The series was created by [[Jonathan Schmock]] and [[Jim Vallely]], and produced by [[Witt/Thomas Productions]] in association with [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]] (season 1) and [[Walt Disney Television]] (season 2). The primary focus of the series is on the relationship of three brothers, played by real-life brothers [[Joey Lawrence]], [[Matthew Lawrence]], and [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]].\n\n==Characters==\n{{inuniverse|section|date=January 2020}}\n===Main===\n* Joseph \"Joe\" Roman (played by [[Joey Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is the oldest of the three brothers. He is a half-brother to Matt and Andy. Claire is his stepmother. He is vain, cocky and arrogant at times, and thinks highly of himself, though he is a good person at heart.  He is constantly fighting for the affection of Lou Davis. His brothers really look up to him as a role model and as a father-figure. He was born on November 10, 1975 as revealed in the episode \"Once Around The Block\" making him 20 years old at the start of the series. Joe was 5 when his father left him and his mother. His father eventually re-married Claire. Together they had Matt and Andy. Joe's father later died in a racing accident. Joe's mother lives in California. Joe is an avid motorcycle fan and works as a mechanic.\n*Matthew \"Matt\" Roman (played by [[Matthew Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is 15\u201316 and is the middle child. He bows to peer pressure easily. He is also put down by his family with some of his doings as well. Matt was an absolute neat freak and germaphobe; at the age of one, he could change his own diaper, and he went through his entire childhood without ever catching the chickenpox. He loved washing the dishes and was known for other odd habits like making \"Matt water\", folding his socks. Unlike Joe and Andy, he never did well with girls. He has a crush on Kristin and is said in the episode, \"I scream, You scream\", that Matt is in love with Kristen.  He sang twice, once in an angel costume singing the last two bars of \"Silent Night\" (A Roman Holiday), the other (Art Attack) when he played his mother's guitar and sang a song called \"Pigeon On Your Car\" which was written by Matt Lawrence himself.\n*Andrew \"Andy\" Roman (played by [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]]) \u2014 He is the youngest.

She is an artist, even having crafted a ring for one of her suitors.  She is always making sarcastic remarks to Joe from what he says about her. In later episodes it is shown that she may have love interests in Joe Roman. Joe and Lou kiss under the mistletoe in an episode called, \"A Roman Holiday\" and in an episode, \"Other people\". Andy is said to be in love with her, and receives an email from him, signed, A Roman who loves you. She automatically believes it was Joe.\n*Claire Roman (played by [[Melinda Culea]]) \u2014 She is Joe's stepmother, and Matt and Andy's mother.

He is overweight and is sometimes needy, but under his gruff exterior lies a sensitive, intelligent man. He used to go by the alias \"The Masked Avenger\", an alias he used to play pranks on Mr. Hangarter, a cruel drivers' education teacher. Lloyd is known to be somewhat stupid and ignorant, but in some episodes has surprised everyone and shown to be very intelligent.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Kristin (played by [[Rebecca Herbst]]) \u2014 She used to attend house parties often, but now has cleaned up her act. She is one of Matt's best friends.  She used to have a crush on Joe. Matt has a crush on her, but she sees him more of a brother than a boyfriend. She was a badgirl and got drunk, but changed after she and Matt started hanging out.\n*Silent Jim (played by Karl David-Djerf) \u2014 He rarely speaks but when he does, Matt describes it as \"something special\".  Instead of speaking he usually communicates with a laugh.  He is a recurring cast member, although, he does not appear in many episodes. \n*Myrna Burwell (played by [[Estelle Getty]], seen only in season two's \"Motherly Love\") \u2014 She is Lloyd\u2019s mother who lives in a trailer, and is part of the reason why Lloyd is so needy. She can do cartwheels despite her age. She also teaches the mambo and is said to clip Lloyd's toenails.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Series overview ===\n{{Series overview\n\n| color1     = #FF5F5C\n| link1      = #Season 1 (1995\u201396)\n| episodes1  = 16\n| start1     = {{Start date|1995|9|16}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1996|4|1}}\n\n| color2     = #9400B6\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1996\u201397)\n| episodes2  = 24\n| start2     = {{Start date|1996|9|15}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1997|5|18}}\n\n}}\n\n=== Season 1 (1995\u201396) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FF5F5C |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{ Episode list \n | EpisodeNumber=1\n | EpisodeNumber2=1 \n | Title=Pilot\n | DirectedBy=[[Terry Hughes (director)|Terry Hughes]]\n | WrittenBy=[[Jim Vallely]] & [[Jonathan Schmock]] \n | OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|9|16}}\n | ProdCode=001\n | ShortSummary= Joe's parents are divorced and he moves away with his mom and his dad starts a new life with his new wife Claire.

The aircraft saw combat in [[Battle of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nA key requirement of the original specification was that the aircraft be powered by engines that were not in demand for other designs. Prototypes with low-power german [[Argus As 410]] engines of {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}} failed acceptance test, a more powerful replacement was found with the french [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] engine of {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}}. \n\nThe design was relatively effective when it was first introduced, and saw service on the Eastern Front in a variety of front-line roles. As the war continued and anti-tank support became the main goal, the aircraft was continually up-gunned, eventually mounting a 75&nbsp;mm gun in the anti-tank role that left the plane barely flyable. Only a small number of these B-3 models were produced, late in the war.\n\n==Design and development==\nBy the mid-1930s, the German military, as well as its counterparts in other countries, had come to see the main role of ground-attack aircraft as the [[interdiction]] of logistics and [[materiel]], a task in which targets were often poorly protected and less likely to be defended by strong, well-coordinated defences. For high-value, well-protected tactical targets, the [[dive bomber]] was becoming the conventional solution.\n\nThe experience of the German ''[[Condor Legion|Kondor Legion]]'' during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936&ndash;39) refuted this idea. Even though it was equipped with types unsuited to the role, such as the [[Henschel Hs 123]] and [[Autocannon|cannon]]-armed versions of the [[Heinkel He 112]], the ''Kondor Legion'' proved that ground-attack aircraft were a very effective weapon. This led to support within the ''Luftwaffe'' for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role, and the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|''Reichsluftministerium'']] (RLM; \"[[Reich]] Air Ministry\") requested tenders for a specialized ground attack aircraft.\n\nIt was anticipated that the main source of damage to such an aircraft would be [[small arms]] fire from the ground, meaning that the plane had to be well-[[Vehicle armour|armored]] around its [[cockpit]] and engines. Similar protection was also needed in the [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]], in the form of 75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) thick [[Bullet-proof glass|armored glass]]. The aircraft was expected to be attacking in low-level, head-on [[strafing]] runs, so the cockpit had to be located as close as possible to the nose, in order to maximize the visibility of its targets. Another, non-operational, requirement severely hampered the designs: the RLM insisted that the new design be powered by engines that were not being used in existing aircraft, so that the type would not interfere with the production of established types deemed essential to the war effort.\n\nOnly four companies were asked to submit tenders; three submissions followed and only two of these were considered worthy of consideration: One derived from an existing [[Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH|Focke-Wulf]] reconnaissance type, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189]], the other was Henschel's all-new Hs 129.\n\n===Prototypes===\nThe Hs 129 was designed around a single large \"bathtub\" of steel sheeting that made up the entire nose area of the plane, completely enclosing the [[Aviator|pilot]] up to head level. Even the canopy was steel, with only tiny windows on the side to see out of and two angled blocks of glass for the windscreen. In order to improve the armor's ability to deflect bullets, the [[fuselage]] sides were angled in forming a triangular shape, resulting in almost no room to move at shoulder level. There was so little room in the cockpit that the instrument panel ended up under the nose below the windscreen where it was almost invisible; some of the engine instruments were moved outside onto the engine nacelles' inboard-facing surfaces and the gunsight was mounted outside on the nose.\n\nHenschel's plane came in 12 percent overweight with the engines 8 percent underpowered, and understandably, it flew poorly. The [[Aircraft flight control system|controls]] proved to be almost inoperable as speed increased, and in testing, the V2 prototype flew into the ground from a short dive on 5 January 1940<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_henschel_hs_129.html</ref> because the stick forces were too high for the pilot to pull out. The Focke-Wulf  design proved to be no better. Both planes were underpowered with their air-cooled, inverted-V12 [[Argus As 410]] engines, and very difficult to fly.\n\nThe RLM nevertheless felt they should continue with the basic concept. The only real deciding factor between the two designs was that the Henschel was smaller and cheaper. The Focke-Wulf was put on low priority as a backup, and testing continued with the Hs 129 A-0. A series of improvements resulted in the '''Hs 129 A-1''' series, armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s and two 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, along with the ability to carry four 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs under the fuselage centreline.\n\n===Hs 129 B-1===\nEven before the A-1s were delivered, the plane was redesigned with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] [[radial engine]]s, which were captured in some number when [[Battle of France|France fell]] and continued to be produced under German occupation. This engine supplied {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}} for takeoff, compared to the Argus at {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}}. The Gnome-Rhone radials were also made in versions with [[Counter-rotating propellers|opposite rotation for the propeller]], and were installed on the Hs 129 with the port engine rotating clockwise and the starboard rotating counterclockwise, as seen from nose-on, thus eliminating engine [[torque]] problems.\n\nThe A-1 planes were converted into '''Hs 129 B-0'''s for testing (although it has been claimed that some As were sold to [[Romania]]) and the pilots were reportedly much happier with the results. Their main complaint was the view from the canopy, so a single larger windscreen and a new canopy with much better vision were added, resulting in the production model '''Hs 129 B-1'''.\n\nB-1s started rolling off the lines in December 1941, but they were delivered at a trickle. In preparation for the new plane, I./[[Schlachtgeschwader 1|SchlG 1]] had been formed up in January with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E/Bs]] (fighter-bomber version of Bf 109 E) and [[Henschel Hs 123|Hs 123]]s, and they delivered B-0s and every B-1 that was completed. Still, it was not until April that 12 B-1s were delivered and the 4th ''staffel'' (squadron) became ready for action. They moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (to [[Crimea]]) in the middle of May 1942, and in June they received a new weapon, the 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;in) [[MK 101 cannon]] with armor-piercing ammunition in a centerline [[Gun pod|pod]].\n\n===Hs 129 B-2===\nDeliveries of the new '''Hs 129 B-2''' model began in May 1942, side by side with the B-1 (of which just 50 planes had been delivered at that point). The only difference between the two were changes to the fuel system &ndash; a host of other minor changes could be found almost at random on either model. These changes accumulated in the B-2 production line until they could eventually be told apart at a glance; the main differences being the removal of the mast for the radio antenna, the addition of a [[Radio direction finder|direction-finding]] [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] loop, and shorter exhaust stacks on the engines.\n\nIn the field, the differences seemed to be more pronounced. The ''[[R\u00fcstsatz]]'' field refit kits were renumbered and some were dropped, and in general, the B-2 planes received the upgraded cannon pack using a 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]] instead of the earlier MK 101. These guns both fired the same ammunition, but the 103 did so at almost twice the rate.\n\nBy late 1942 reports were coming in about the ineffectiveness of the MK 101 against newer versions of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-34]] [[tank]]s. One obvious solution would be to use the larger {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[BK 3,7]] (''Bordkanone'' 3,7), recently adapted from the ground-based [[3.7 cm FlaK 43|Flak 18]]. These guns had already been converted into underwing pod-mounted weapons for the [[Junkers Ju 87G]] and found to be an effective weapon, despite the fact that only 12 shells per pod could be accommodated. When mounted on the Hs 129, the empty area behind the cockpit could be used for ammunition storage, greatly increasing the supply compared to the Ju. The B-2/R3 package introduced the [[BK 3,7]] {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} automatic cannon, but relatively few aircraft were converted in favour of the B-3, mounting the BK 7,5.\n\n===Hs 129 B-3===\n[[File:Hs 129B-3.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of the ''Bordkanone'' BK 7,5 75 mm cannon.]]\n\nIt was decided that the {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} semi-automatic [[Rheinmetall]] [[7.5 cm Pak 40|PaK 40]] anti-tank gun, which had already been adapted for use in the [[Junkers Ju 88]]P-1, would be further modified for use in the Hs 129. This resulted in the BK 7,5 (''Bordkanone'' 7,5), which, even though it weighed {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, was lighter than the PaK 40. Fully automatic, it featured a new, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[recoil]]-dampening system and a new, more aerodynamic [[muzzle brake]]. An [[autoloader]] system, with 12 rounds in a rotary magazine, was fitted in the empty space behind the cockpit, within the rear half of the wing root area. The gun and its recoil mechanism occupied a substantial [[gun pod]] under the fuselage, and a circular port at the rear of the pod allowed rearwards ejection of spent cartridges immediately after firing. While this new variant, the '''Hs 129 B-3''', was theoretically capable of destroying any tank in the world, the added weight worsened the aircraft's general performance and it was inferior to previous variants.<ref>[http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html DeutscheLuftwaffe.de's German language page for the BK 7,5 autocannon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517081256/http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html |date=2016-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Bordkanone'' 7,5 was the heaviest and most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production [[military aircraft]] during World War II. The only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar-calibre guns were the 1,420 examples of the North American [[B-25 Mitchell#Variants|B-25G and B-25H Mitchell]], which mounted either a {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|M4 cannon]], or lightweight T13E1 or M5 versions of the same gun.\n\nFrom June 1944, only 25 examples of the Hs 129 B-3 arrived at frontline units before the production line was shut down in September (a small number were reportedly also created by converting B-2 aircraft). In the field the B-3 proved effective, but its small numbers had little effect on the war effort.\n\n===Hs 129 C===\nIn order to address the poor performance of the aircraft, plans had been under way for some time to fit the plane with newer versions of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Isotta-Fraschini Delta]] air-cooled inverted V12 inline engine that delivered 630&nbsp;kW (850&nbsp;hp) and weighed some 510 kg (1,111 lb) apiece, providing more power than Germany's own [[Argus As 411]] engine of similar configuration and lighter (385 kg) weight. The engine installation ran into a number of delays however, and was still not ready for production when the plant was overrun by the Allies in 1945.\n\n===Hs 129 D===\nPlanned version of the Hs 129.

A series of improvements resulted in the '''Hs 129 A-1''' series, armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s and two 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, along with the ability to carry four 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs under the fuselage centreline.\n\n===Hs 129 B-1===\nEven before the A-1s were delivered, the plane was redesigned with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] [[radial engine]]s, which were captured in some number when [[Battle of France|France fell]] and continued to be produced under German occupation. This engine supplied {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}} for takeoff, compared to the Argus at {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}}. The Gnome-Rhone radials were also made in versions with [[Counter-rotating propellers|opposite rotation for the propeller]], and were installed on the Hs 129 with the port engine rotating clockwise and the starboard rotating counterclockwise, as seen from nose-on, thus eliminating engine [[torque]] problems.\n\nThe A-1 planes were converted into '''Hs 129 B-0'''s for testing (although it has been claimed that some As were sold to [[Romania]]) and the pilots were reportedly much happier with the results. Their main complaint was the view from the canopy, so a single larger windscreen and a new canopy with much better vision were added, resulting in the production model '''Hs 129 B-1'''.\n\nB-1s started rolling off the lines in December 1941, but they were delivered at a trickle. In preparation for the new plane, I./[[Schlachtgeschwader 1|SchlG 1]] had been formed up in January with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E/Bs]] (fighter-bomber version of Bf 109 E) and [[Henschel Hs 123|Hs 123]]s, and they delivered B-0s and every B-1 that was completed. Still, it was not until April that 12 B-1s were delivered and the 4th ''staffel'' (squadron) became ready for action. They moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (to [[Crimea]]) in the middle of May 1942, and in June they received a new weapon, the 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;in) [[MK 101 cannon]] with armor-piercing ammunition in a centerline [[Gun pod|pod]].\n\n===Hs 129 B-2===\nDeliveries of the new '''Hs 129 B-2''' model began in May 1942, side by side with the B-1 (of which just 50 planes had been delivered at that point). The only difference between the two were changes to the fuel system &ndash; a host of other minor changes could be found almost at random on either model. These changes accumulated in the B-2 production line until they could eventually be told apart at a glance; the main differences being the removal of the mast for the radio antenna, the addition of a [[Radio direction finder|direction-finding]] [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] loop, and shorter exhaust stacks on the engines.\n\nIn the field, the differences seemed to be more pronounced. The ''[[R\u00fcstsatz]]'' field refit kits were renumbered and some were dropped, and in general, the B-2 planes received the upgraded cannon pack using a 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]] instead of the earlier MK 101. These guns both fired the same ammunition, but the 103 did so at almost twice the rate.\n\nBy late 1942 reports were coming in about the ineffectiveness of the MK 101 against newer versions of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-34]] [[tank]]s. One obvious solution would be to use the larger {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[BK 3,7]] (''Bordkanone'' 3,7), recently adapted from the ground-based [[3.7 cm FlaK 43|Flak 18]]. These guns had already been converted into underwing pod-mounted weapons for the [[Junkers Ju 87G]] and found to be an effective weapon, despite the fact that only 12 shells per pod could be accommodated. When mounted on the Hs 129, the empty area behind the cockpit could be used for ammunition storage, which would address the only problem with the Ju 87's mounting: the limited ammunition supply. The B-2/R3 package introduced the [[BK 3,7]] {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} automatic cannon, but relatively few aircraft were converted in favour of the B-3, mounting the BK 7,5.\n\n===Hs 129 B-3===\n[[File:Hs 129B-3.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of the ''Bordkanone'' BK 7,5 75 mm cannon.]]\n\nIt was decided that the {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} semi-automatic [[Rheinmetall]] [[7.5 cm Pak 40|PaK 40]] anti-tank gun, which had already been adapted for use in the [[Junkers Ju 88]]P-1, would be further modified for use in the Hs 129. This resulted in the BK 7,5 (''Bordkanone'' 7,5), which, even though it weighed {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, was lighter than the PaK 40. Fully automatic, it featured a new, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[recoil]]-dampening system and a new, more aerodynamic [[muzzle brake]]. An [[autoloader]] system, with 12 rounds in a rotary magazine, was fitted in the empty space behind the cockpit, within the rear half of the wing root area. The gun and its recoil mechanism occupied a substantial [[gun pod]] under the fuselage, and a circular port at the rear of the pod allowed rearwards ejection of spent cartridges immediately after firing. While this new variant, the '''Hs 129 B-3''', was theoretically capable of destroying any tank in the world, the added weight worsened the aircraft's general performance and it was inferior to previous variants.<ref>[http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html DeutscheLuftwaffe.de's German language page for the BK 7,5 autocannon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517081256/http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html |date=2016-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Bordkanone'' 7,5 was the heaviest and most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production [[military aircraft]] during World War II. The only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar-calibre guns were the 1,420 examples of the North American [[B-25 Mitchell#Variants|B-25G and B-25H Mitchell]], which mounted either a {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|M4 cannon]], or lightweight T13E1 or M5 versions of the same gun.\n\nFrom June 1944, only 25 examples of the Hs 129 B-3 arrived at frontline units before the production line was shut down in September (a small number were reportedly also created by converting B-2 aircraft). In the field the B-3 proved effective, but its small numbers had little effect on the war effort.\n\n===Hs 129 C===\nIn order to address the poor performance of the aircraft, plans had been under way for some time to fit the plane with newer versions of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Isotta-Fraschini Delta]] air-cooled inverted V12 inline engine that delivered 630&nbsp;kW (850&nbsp;hp) and weighed some 510 kg (1,111 lb) apiece, providing more power than Germany's own [[Argus As 411]] engine of similar configuration and lighter (385 kg) weight. The engine installation ran into a number of delays however, and was still not ready for production when the plant was overrun by the Allies in 1945.\n\n===Hs 129 D===\nPlanned version of the Hs 129.

He was a backup wide receiver in his first 2 seasons.\n\nHe became a starter as a junior, teaming with [[Tim Barnett (American football)|Tim Barnett]] and becoming the top receiving duo in [[Division I-AA]], while registering 40 receptions (led the team) for 877 yards (21.3-yard average) and 9 [[touchdown]]s. Against [[Southern University]], he made 4 receptions for 184 yards and tied a school record with 3 receiving [[touchdown]]s (70,64 and 37 yards).\n\nIn his final year, he led the team with 43 catches for 801 yards (18.4-yard average) and 3 [[touchdown]]s. He finished his college career with 110 receptions, 2,073 yards and 16 [[touchdown]]s. Against [[Delaware State University]], he set a school record with 10 receptions for 239 yards, including a 71-yard [[touchdown]]. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration.<ref name=\"jimmysmithathletics.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, he was named to the [[Jackson State University]] All-Century team.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\nSmith was selected by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round (36th overall) of the [[1992 NFL Draft]]. He missed the first four games after he broke his right [[fibula]] during the Dallas Blue-White Scrimmage on July 19. After missing ample time during the season, he was listed as the fourth wide receiver on the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys']] depth chart, behind [[Michael Irvin]], [[Alvin Harper]], and [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]]. On October 11, he made his professional regular season debut during a 27-0 victory over the [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. In a Week 16 matchup against the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Smith had the highlight of his rookie year, tackling [[Deion Sanders]] during a punt return in a 41-17 victory. He played in just seven games as a special teamer, without registering a reception. The Cowboys finished first in the [[NFC East]] with a 13-3 record. On January 10, 1993, he appeared in his first career playoff game during the Cowboys 34-10 win over the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], playing on [[special teams]]. Smith earned the first ring of his career as a rookie, after the Cowboys went on to [[Super Bowl XXVII]] and defeated the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 52-17.\n\nIn [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]], he was leading the team in pre-season (13) and receiving yards (197), while competing for the role as the third wide receiver that was left open with the departure in [[free agency]] of [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]], behind Irvin and Harper. On August 21, Smith began feeling a pain in his abdominal area and brought it to the attention of two trainers and the team doctor, J.D. Zamarano, and was given [[Pepto Bismol]], [[Maalox]], and [[Tagamet]]. He played in the next preseason game and caught a touchdown reception, and was waved back in by a coach after taking himself out from taking a hit to the abdominal area that worsened the pain. Over the next few days he repeatedly brought the pain to the attention of the trainers and wasn't given adequate care or the correct diagnosis. He asked to be directed to a doctor and was told to see the team doctor who gave him a check up and took him to see the team surgeon that finally diagnosed him with [[appendicitis]]. On August 24, 1993, he underwent an emergency [[appendectomy]] surgery. The following day, he was released from the hospital by the surgeon although he had a 102.5 degree fever. On August 27, Smith was readmitted into the hospital after he woke up in severe pain with his stomach bloated and was vomiting, because of a severe post-surgical infection that was nearly fatal. He went into emergency surgery for an [[Ileostomy]], where they dissect and removed his intestine then substituted an external bag to collect his fecal matter, forcing Smith to miss the entire season, including [[Super Bowl XXVIII]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20000123&id=fjofAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5s8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2065,2664744&hl=en | title=Detours don't stop Jacksonville's Smith | accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 2, the Cowboys placed him on the non-football illness list and opted not to pay his entire $350,000 salary for the 1993 season, as well as his insurance, pension, and free agent credits, making Smith instead an offer of $100,000 and no credits, which he declined.<ref>{{cite web| title=ANATOMY OF AN NFL GRIEVANCE: JIMMY SMITH VS.

He missed the first four games after he broke his right [[fibula]] during the Dallas Blue-White Scrimmage on July 19. After missing ample time during the season, he was listed as the fourth wide receiver on the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys']] depth chart, behind [[Michael Irvin]], [[Alvin Harper]], and [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]]. On October 11, he made his professional regular season debut during a 27-0 victory over the [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. In a Week 16 matchup against the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Smith had the highlight of his rookie year, tackling [[Deion Sanders]] during a punt return in a 41-17 victory. He played in just seven games as a special teamer, without registering a reception. The Cowboys finished first in the [[NFC East]] with a 13-3 record. On January 10, 1993, he appeared in his first career playoff game during the Cowboys 34-10 win over the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], playing on [[special teams]]. Smith earned the first ring of his career as a rookie, after the Cowboys went on to [[Super Bowl XXVII]] and defeated the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 52-17.\n\nIn [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]], he was leading the team in pre-season (13) and receiving yards (197), while competing for the role as the third wide receiver that was left open with the departure in [[free agency]] of [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]], behind Irvin and Harper. On August 21, Smith began feeling a pain in his abdominal area and brought it to the attention of two trainers and the team doctor, J.D. Zamarano, and was given [[Pepto Bismol]], [[Maalox]], and [[Tagamet]]. He played in the next preseason game and caught a touchdown reception, and was waved back in by a coach after taking himself out from taking a hit to the abdominal area that worsened the pain. Over the next few days he repeatedly brought the pain to the attention of the trainers and wasn't given adequate care or the correct diagnosis. He asked to be directed to a doctor and was told to see the team doctor who gave him a check up and took him to see the team surgeon that finally diagnosed him with [[appendicitis]]. On August 24, 1993, he underwent an emergency [[appendectomy]] surgery. The following day, he was released from the hospital by the surgeon although he had a 102.5 degree fever. On August 27, Smith was readmitted into the hospital after he woke up in severe pain with his stomach bloated and was vomiting, because of a severe post-surgical infection that was nearly fatal. He went into emergency surgery for an [[Ileostomy]], where they dissect and removed his intestine then substituted an external bag to collect his fecal matter, forcing Smith to miss the entire season, including [[Super Bowl XXVIII]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20000123&id=fjofAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5s8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2065,2664744&hl=en | title=Detours don't stop Jacksonville's Smith | accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 2, the Cowboys placed him on the non-football illness list and opted not to pay his entire $350,000 salary for the 1993 season, as well as his insurance, pension, and free agent credits, making Smith instead an offer of $100,000 and no credits, which he declined.<ref>{{cite web| title=ANATOMY OF AN NFL GRIEVANCE: JIMMY SMITH VS.

The term usually refers to a family of drugs used in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]] that were introduced in the late 1990s.\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nThiazolidinediones or TZDs act by activating [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|PPAR]]s (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), a group of [[nuclear receptors]], specific for ''[[PPAR\u03b3]]'' (PPAR-gamma, PPARG). They are thus the PPARG agonists subset of [[PPAR agonist]]s. The endogenous [[ligand]]s for these receptors are free [[fatty acid]]s (FFAs) and [[eicosanoid]]s. When activated, the receptor binds to [[DNA]] in complex with the [[retinoid X receptor]] (RXR), another nuclear receptor, increasing [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a number of specific [[gene]]s and decreasing transcription of others. The main effect of expression and repression of specific genes is an increase in the storage of fatty acids in adipocytes, thereby decreasing the amount of fatty acids present in circulation{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. As a result, cells become more dependent on the oxidation of [[carbohydrates]], more specifically [[glucose]], in order to yield energy for other cellular processes{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.\n\n===PPAR\u03b3 transactivation===\n[[File:Transactivation upload.svg|thumb|Thiazolidinedione ligand dependent transactivation is responsible for the majority of anti-diabetic effects.]]\nThe activated PPAR/RXR [[Protein dimer|heterodimer]] binds to peroxisome proliferator [[hormone response element]]s upstream of target genes in complex with a number of [[coactivator (genetics)|coactivators]] such as [[nuclear receptor coactivator 1]] and [[CREB binding protein]], this causes upregulation of genes (for a full list see [[PPAR\u03b3]]):\n* [[Insulin resistance]] is decreased\n* [[Adipocyte]] differentiation is modified<ref name=\"pmid20158086\">{{cite journal |pmid=20158086 |year=2010 |last1=Waki |first1=H |title=Regulation of differentiation and hypertrophy of adipocytes and adipokine network by PPARgamma |journal=Nihon Rinsho |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=210\u20136 |last2=Yamauchi |first2=T |last3=Kadowaki |first3=T }}</ref>\n* [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]]-induced [[angiogenesis]] is inhibited<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI15634 |pmid=12370270 |pmc=151148 |title=PPAR\u03b3 ligands inhibit primary tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting angiogenesis |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=110 |issue=7 |pages=923\u201332 |year=2002 |last1=Panigrahy |first1=Dipak |last2=Singer |first2=Samuel |last3=Shen |first3=Lucy Q. |last4=Butterfield |first4=Catherine E. |last5=Freedman |first5=Deborah A. |last6=Chen |first6=Emy J. |last7=Moses |first7=Marsha A. |last8=Kilroy |first8=Susan |last9=Duensing |first9=Stefan |last10=Fletcher |first10=Christopher |last11=Fletcher |first11=Jonathan A. |last12=Hlatky |first12=Lynn |last13=Hahnfeldt |first13=Philip |last14=Folkman |first14=Judah |last15=Kaipainen |first15=Arja }}</ref>\n* [[Leptin]] levels decrease (leading to an increased [[appetite]])\n* Levels of certain [[interleukin]]s (e.g. IL-6) fall\n* [[Antiproliferative]] action{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n* [[Adiponectin]] levels rise\n\nTZDs also increase the synthesis of certain proteins involved in fat and glucose metabolism, which reduces levels of certain types of lipids, and circulating free fatty acids.

They are thus the PPARG agonists subset of [[PPAR agonist]]s. The endogenous [[ligand]]s for these receptors are free [[fatty acid]]s (FFAs) and [[eicosanoid]]s. When activated, the receptor binds to [[DNA]] in complex with the [[retinoid X receptor]] (RXR), another nuclear receptor, increasing [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a number of specific [[gene]]s and decreasing transcription of others. The main effect of expression and repression of specific genes is an increase in the storage of fatty acids in adipocytes, thereby decreasing the amount of fatty acids present in circulation{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}.

For example, the greater visibility of some forms of prostitution, such as [[street prostitution]], makes statistics on these forms easier to collect. However, in some countries street prostitution forms a much smaller part of the [[sex industry]] than indoor prostitution. Similarly sex workers with health, addiction and other support needs are more likely to be known to the authorities and hence easier for researchers to contact, but may not be representative of prostitution as a whole.  [[UK Network of Sex Work Projects#National Ugly Mugs (NUM)|National Ugly Mugs]], a support organisation for [[sex worker]]s in the United Kingdom, has identified several factors making it difficult to collect statistics for the sex industry, including low response rates, the small scale of research compared to the size of the sex industry, and the diversity of the industry. As a result published statistics are often conflicting and contested.<ref>{{cite report|title=Prostitution: Third Report of Session 2016\u201317|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/26/26.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|author=Home Affairs Committee|date=15 June 2016|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nIn countries where prostitution is illegal, the use of arrest data to create general prostitution statistics can be misleading. The majority of prostitutes are never arrested, and those who are can often be charged with other offences instead. Class bias may be introduced into the statistics as a result of police officers being more likely to arrest street prostitutes than high-class [[call girl]]s. In comparing one area with another there may be differences in the definition of a crime, the police enforcement rate, and the possibility of the inflation of arrest figures or the [[under-reporting]] of crime.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Prostitution of Women and Girls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC|first=Ronald B.|last=Flowers|publisher=McFarland|year=1998|isbn=9780786404902|page=15}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unregulated and often illegal nature of the work, only estimates are available for the number of prostitutes in a country. The numbers for a country can vary considerably dependent on the source. Some countries' numbers may suffer from poor methodology. In other cases, results may be influenced by whether the organisation producing the numbers is for or against the nature of the work.

For example, the greater visibility of some forms of prostitution, such as [[street prostitution]], makes statistics on these forms easier to collect. However, in some countries street prostitution forms a much smaller part of the [[sex industry]] than indoor prostitution. Similarly sex workers with health, addiction and other support needs are more likely to be known to the authorities and hence easier for researchers to contact, but may not be representative of prostitution as a whole.  [[UK Network of Sex Work Projects#National Ugly Mugs (NUM)|National Ugly Mugs]], a support organisation for [[sex worker]]s in the United Kingdom, has identified several factors making it difficult to collect statistics for the sex industry, including low response rates, the small scale of research compared to the size of the sex industry, and the diversity of the industry. As a result published statistics are often conflicting and contested.<ref>{{cite report|title=Prostitution: Third Report of Session 2016\u201317|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/26/26.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|author=Home Affairs Committee|date=15 June 2016|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nIn countries where prostitution is illegal, the use of arrest data to create general prostitution statistics can be misleading. The majority of prostitutes are never arrested, and those who are can often be charged with other offences instead. Class bias may be introduced into the statistics as a result of police officers being more likely to arrest street prostitutes than high-class [[call girl]]s. In comparing one area with another there may be differences in the definition of a crime, the police enforcement rate, and the possibility of the inflation of arrest figures or the [[under-reporting]] of crime.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Prostitution of Women and Girls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC|first=Ronald B.|last=Flowers|publisher=McFarland|year=1998|isbn=9780786404902|page=15}}</ref>\n\nDue to the unregulated and often illegal nature of the work, only estimates are available for the number of prostitutes in a country. The numbers for a country can vary considerably dependent on the source. Some countries' numbers may suffer from poor methodology. In other cases, results may be influenced by whether the organisation producing the numbers is for or against the nature of the work.

More specialized identification was done with German [[concentration camp]] badges on the clothing and also with [[armband]]s.\n\n==Numbers==\nA practice was established to [[tattoo]] the inmates with identification numbers. Initially, in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], the camp numbers were sewn on the clothes; with the increased death rate, it became difficult to identify corpses, since clothes were removed from corpses. Therefore, the medical personnel started to write the numbers on the corpses' chests with [[indelible ink]]. Difficulties increased in 1941 when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] came in masses, and the first few thousand tattoos were applied to them. This was done with a special stamp with the numbers to be tattooed composed of needles. The tattoo was applied to the upper left part of the breast. In March 1942, the same method was used in [[Brzezinka|Birkenau]].{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe common belief that all concentration camps put tattoos on inmates is not true. The misconception is because Auschwitz inmates were often sent to other camps and liberated from there. They would show a number, but it came from their time at Auschwitz.<ref>https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007056\n</ref>\nMetal stamps turned out to be impractical, and later numbers were tattooed with a single needle on the left forearm.\n\nThe tattoo was the prisoner's camp entry number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some [[Jew]]s had a triangle, and [[Romani people|Romani]] had the letter \"Z\" (from [[German language|German]] ''Zigeuner'' for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers.  For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series.<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-first=Franciszek |editor1-last=Piper |editor-link1=Franciszek Piper |editor2-first=Teresa |editor2-last=\u015awiebocka |editor-link2=Teresa \u015awiebocka |title=Auschwitz: Nazi Death Camp |others=Trans. by Douglas Selvage |location=O\u015bwi\u0119cim |publisher=The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum |date=1996 |pages=60\u201361 |isbn=9788385047568 |oclc=36524125}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"ID numbers\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Auschwitz survivor displays tattoo detail.jpg|[[Auschwitz]] survivor Sam Rosenzweig displays his identification tattoo.\nFile:US Navy 110505-N-DX615-012 Holocaust survivor Rose Schindler shows the prisoner number tattoo on her arm to Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class .jpg|Holocaust survivor Rose Schindler shows the number tattoo on her arm to a U.S. Navy serviceman.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0716-0005-014, Oberstes Gericht, Globke-Prozess, Zeugin, Eva Furth.jpg|Number tattoo visible on the arm of camp survivor (and, in this photo, 1963 courtroom witness) Eva Furth.\nFile:Buchenwald Survivor Tattoo 59963.jpg|Newly liberated [[Buchenwald]] survivor shows his ID tattoo.\nFile:Ebensee concentration camp prisoners 1945.jpg|Just-liberated [[Ebensee concentration camp]] survivors wear (and some show to the camera) metal tags bearing ID numbers on cord bracelets or necklaces.\n</gallery>\n\n==Cloth emblems==\n{{main|Nazi concentration camp badges}}\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nColored inverted triangles were used in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the German-occupied countries to identify the reason the prisoners had been placed there. The triangles were made of fabric and were sewn on jackets and shirts of the prisoners. These mandatory badges had specific meanings indicated by their color and shape. The system of badges varied somewhat between the camps. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees: for example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a \"tough\" temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty. Someone with an \"escape suspect\" mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence.  Someone wearing an ''F'' could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent ''X'' on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp |page=76 |first=Rochelle G. |last=Saidel |date=2006 |location=Madison, Wis. |publisher=Terrace Books |isbn=9780299198640 |oclc=65204194 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> This made for an ''[[ersatz]]'' prisoner uniform.

More specialized identification was done with German [[concentration camp]] badges on the clothing and also with [[armband]]s.\n\n==Numbers==\nA practice was established to [[tattoo]] the inmates with identification numbers. Initially, in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], the camp numbers were sewn on the clothes; with the increased death rate, it became difficult to identify corpses, since clothes were removed from corpses. Therefore, the medical personnel started to write the numbers on the corpses' chests with [[indelible ink]]. Difficulties increased in 1941 when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] came in masses, and the first few thousand tattoos were applied to them. This was done with a special stamp with the numbers to be tattooed composed of needles. The tattoo was applied to the upper left part of the breast. In March 1942, the same method was used in [[Brzezinka|Birkenau]].{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe common belief that all concentration camps put tattoos on inmates is not true. The misconception is because Auschwitz inmates were often sent to other camps and liberated from there. They would show a number, but it came from their time at Auschwitz.<ref>https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007056\n</ref>\nMetal stamps turned out to be impractical, and later numbers were tattooed with a single needle on the left forearm.\n\nThe tattoo was the prisoner's camp entry number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some [[Jew]]s had a triangle, and [[Romani people|Romani]] had the letter \"Z\" (from [[German language|German]] ''Zigeuner'' for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers.  For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series.<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-first=Franciszek |editor1-last=Piper |editor-link1=Franciszek Piper |editor2-first=Teresa |editor2-last=\u015awiebocka |editor-link2=Teresa \u015awiebocka |title=Auschwitz: Nazi Death Camp |others=Trans. by Douglas Selvage |location=O\u015bwi\u0119cim |publisher=The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum |date=1996 |pages=60\u201361 |isbn=9788385047568 |oclc=36524125}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"ID numbers\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Auschwitz survivor displays tattoo detail.jpg|[[Auschwitz]] survivor Sam Rosenzweig displays his identification tattoo.\nFile:US Navy 110505-N-DX615-012 Holocaust survivor Rose Schindler shows the prisoner number tattoo on her arm to Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class .jpg|Holocaust survivor Rose Schindler shows the number tattoo on her arm to a U.S. Navy serviceman.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0716-0005-014, Oberstes Gericht, Globke-Prozess, Zeugin, Eva Furth.jpg|Number tattoo visible on the arm of camp survivor (and, in this photo, 1963 courtroom witness) Eva Furth.\nFile:Buchenwald Survivor Tattoo 59963.jpg|Newly liberated [[Buchenwald]] survivor shows his ID tattoo.\nFile:Ebensee concentration camp prisoners 1945.jpg|Just-liberated [[Ebensee concentration camp]] survivors wear (and some show to the camera) metal tags bearing ID numbers on cord bracelets or necklaces.\n</gallery>\n\n==Cloth emblems==\n{{main|Nazi concentration camp badges}}\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nColored inverted triangles were used in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the German-occupied countries to identify the reason the prisoners had been placed there. The triangles were made of fabric and were sewn on jackets and shirts of the prisoners. These mandatory badges had specific meanings indicated by their color and shape. The system of badges varied somewhat between the camps. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees: for example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a \"tough\" temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty. Someone with an \"escape suspect\" mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence.  Someone wearing an ''F'' could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent ''X'' on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp |page=76 |first=Rochelle G. |last=Saidel |date=2006 |location=Madison, Wis. |publisher=Terrace Books |isbn=9780299198640 |oclc=65204194 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref> This made for an ''[[ersatz]]'' prisoner uniform. For permanence, such ''X''s were made with white oil paint, with sewn-on cloth strips, or were cut (with underlying jacket-liner fabric providing the contrasting color).  Detainees would be compelled to sew their number and (if applicable) a triangle emblem onto the fronts of such ''X''-ed clothing.<ref name=Saidel/>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some examples of ID cloth badges\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1993-051-07, Tafel mit KZ-Kennzeichen (Winkel) retouched.jpg|Nazi camp ID-emblems in a 1936 German illustration.\nFile:Prisoners' Uniforms with Red Triangles of Political Prisoners - Museum Exhibit - Dachau Concentration Camp Site - Dachau - Bavaria - Germany.jpg|Red triangle emblems of a political enemy on a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] detainee's clothing.
