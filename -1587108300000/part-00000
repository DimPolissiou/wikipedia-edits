Historically the term '''electric street railways''' was also used in the United States. In the United States, the term ''tram'' has sometimes been used for rubber-tired [[trackless train]]s, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.\n\nTram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and [[rapid transit]] trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] sliding on an [[overhead line]]; older systems may use a [[trolley pole]] or a [[bow collector]]. In some cases, a [[contact shoe]] on a [[third rail]] is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems\u2014electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry [[freight (rail)|freight]].\n\nTrams are now commonly included in the wider term \"[[light rail]]\",<ref>Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 \u00a9 HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014</ref> which also includes [[grade-separated]] systems. Some trams, known as [[tram-train]]s, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to [[interurban]] systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features.\n\nOne of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low [[rolling resistance]] of metal wheels on [[steel]] rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Problems included the high [[total cost of ownership]] of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence in recent years.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\nThe English terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' are derived from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word {{lang|sco|tram}},<ref>{{cite web|url = https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/tram_n_2 |title = tram, n.<sup>2</sup> |work = A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (up to 1700)|publisher = Dictionary of the Scots Language}}</ref> referring respectively to a type of truck ([[goods wagon]] or freight [[railroad car]]) used in [[coal mining|coal mines]] and the tracks on which they ran. The word ''tram'' probably derived from [[Middle Dutch|Middle Flemish]] {{lang |dum|trame}} (\"beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung\"). The identical word {{lang|fr|la trame}} with the meaning \"crossbeam\" is also used in the [[French language]].

The term ''streetcar'' is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to [[horsecar]]s. When electrification came, Americans began to speak of ''trolleycars'' or later, ''trolleys''. A widely held belief holds the word to derive from the ''troller'' (said to derive from the words ''traveler'' and ''roller''), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the [[overhead wire]]s;<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

Conventional diesel [[bus|tourist buses]] decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called ''trolleys'' in the US ([[tourist trolley]]). Furthering confusion, the term ''tram'' has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed [[trackless train|segmented vehicles on rubber tires]] generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the [[Universal Studios Backlot Tour|Universal Studios backlot tour]] and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]].\n\nAlthough the use of the term ''trolley'' for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the ''[[trolleybus]]'', a rubber-tyred vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called ''trackless trolleys'' (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply ''trolleys'' (in the UK, as well as the [[Pacific Northwest]], including [[Seattle]], and [[Vancouver]]).\n\nThe [[New South Wales]] government in Australia has decided to use the term \"light rail\" for their trams.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of trams}}\n\nThe history of trams, streetcars or trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century.

Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street railway running in [[Baltimore]] as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] developed by the Irish coach builder [[John Stephenson (coachbuilder)|John Stephenson]], in New York City which began service in the year 1832.{{sfn|Dunbar|1967|pp=16\u201317}}<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co].

The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|title=Transportation Technology|website=www.siemens.com|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|archive-date=29 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:The last of the Horse Drawn Carriages.JPG|thumb|Horse-drawn trams continued to be used in [[New York City]] until 1917.]]\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century.

The first and most common had a small [[steam locomotive]] (called a [[tram engine]] in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train.

The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Trams in Rockhampton|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n===Cable-hauled===\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[File:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums of the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway]]\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Cable cars in Chicago|Chicago]], having been built in stages between 1859 and 1892. New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bowery boys : adventures In Old New York : an unconventional exploration of Manhattan's historic neighborhoods, secret spots and colorful characters |publisher=Ulysses Press |isbn=1612435769 |page=179 |date=18 April 2016 }}</ref> Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n[[File:Melbourne\u2019s first cable tram.jpg|thumb|The first [[Melbourne cable tramway system|cable car service in Melbourne]], 1885. From its founding to 1940, Melbourne operated one of the largest cable car networks in the world.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in [[Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,<ref>[[Trams in Sydney]]</ref> and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.\n\nIn [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n[[File:San Francisco Cable Car MC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[San Francisco cable cars|San Francisco cable car]] in 2008. The cable car's effectiveness in hilly environments partially explains its continued use in San Francisco.]]\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n===Gas===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1921\u20131951); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

Derailed electric trams are a hazard, as it requires contact with the rails for the current's return path.]]\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British terminology, such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs.

The motivation now is to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and damage to road surfaces in city centres.\n\nOne recent proposal to bring cargo tramways back into wider use was the plan by [[City Cargo Amsterdam]] to reintroduce them into the city of [[Amsterdam]]. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of [[lorries]] (5,000) unloading in the [[inner city]] during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a \"hub\" where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small [[Shipping container|containers]] to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of \u20ac100&nbsp;million in a [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] of 52 cargo trams distributing from four peripheral \"cross docks\" to 15 inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be {{convert|30|ft|m|2}} long with 12 [[axle]]s and a [[Cargo|payload]] of {{convert|30|t|ST LT|1|lk=on}}. On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;a.m. and two per hour between 11&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;p.m. With each unloading operation taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour. In early 2009 the scheme was suspended owing to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis]] impeding fund-raising.<ref>\"Samenwest\"  ''5 December 2006, NOS3 television news 7 March 2007, ''Amsterdams Stadblad 4 June 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|title=Delivering Case studies - Eltis goods by cargo tram in Amsterdam (Netherlands) |website=www.eltis.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820161058/http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Dog car===\nIn 1937, Melbourne passenger tramcar C class number 30 was converted for transporting dogs and their owners to the [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]].

Some double-decker trams have open tops. The earliest double-deck trams were horse drawn. The first electric double-deck trams were those built for the Blackpool Tramway in 1885, one of which survives at the [[National Tramway Museum]].\n\nDouble decker trams were commonplace in Great Britain and [[Dublin]] in Ireland before most tramways were torn up in the 1950s and 1960s. New York City's [[New York Railways]] experimented in 1912 with a [[JG Brill Company|Brill]] double deck Hedley-Doyle stepless centre entrance car, nicknamed the \"Broadway Battleship\", a term that spread to other large streetcars.<ref name=\"Bain Smithsonian\">{{cite web|last1=Bain|first1=George|title=New Double-deck Streetcar \u2013 N.Y.|url=http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.10615/|publisher=Bain News Service|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195932/http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.10615/|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Hobart]], Tasmania, Australia made extensive use of double decker trams. Arguably the most unusual double-decker tram used to run between the isolated Western Australian [[outback]] town of [[Leonora, Western Australia|Leonora]] and the nearby settlement of [[Gwalia, Western Australia|Gwalia]].\n\nDouble decker trams still operate in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Blackpool Tramway|Blackpool]], [[Hong Kong Tramways|Hong Kong]], [[Dubai Trolley|Dubai]] and [[Trams in Oranjestad|Oranjestad]].\n\n===Drop-Centre (lowered central section)===\nMany early 20th century trams used a lowered central section between the [[bogies]] (trucks). This made passenger access easier, reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. These cars were frequently referred to as \"drop-centres\". It is believed that the design first originated in [[Trams in Christchurch|Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1906 when Boon & Co Ltd. built 26 such trams in three series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|title=Tramway Historical Society \u2013 Welcome|website=www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406015134/http://ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|archivedate=6 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A number of these trams have been preserved. They were a popular design in [[Trams in Australia|Australia]] and [[Trams in New Zealand|New Zealand]], with at least 780 such tramcars being built for use in Melbourne alone.

This allows them to load passengers, including those in [[wheelchair]]s or with [[Baby transport|perambulator]]s directly from low-rise platforms that are not much more than raised footpaths/sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive [[wheelchair lift]]s, while at the same time making boarding faster and easier for other passengers. Passengers appreciate the ease of boarding and alighting from low-floor trams and moving about inside 100 per cent low-floor trams. Passenger satisfaction with low-floor trams is high.<ref name=Yarra /> In some jurisdictions this has even been made mandatory since the 1990s, for example by [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate]] in Britain and the [[Disability Discrimination Act]] in the United Kingdom and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.\n\nVarious companies have developed particular low-floor designs, varying from part-low-floor (with internal steps between the low-floor section and the high-floor sections over the bogies), e.g. Citytram<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trampower.co.uk |title=TRAM Power home &#124; City Class Tram and LR55 rail system |publisher=Trampower.co.uk |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215222250/http://www.trampower.co.uk/ |archivedate=15 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[Siemens S70]], to 100 per cent low-floor, where the floor passes through a corridor between the drive wheels, thus maintaining a relatively constant (stepless) level from end to end of the tram.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the [[\u0160koda 15 T|\u0160koda ForCity]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, that carried the mechanical penalty of requiring bogies to be fixed and unable to pivot (except for less than 5 degrees in some trams) and thus reducing [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve negotiation]].

In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about 18&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;inches above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complicated electronic steering of the [[traction motor]]s. Auxiliary devices are installed largely under the car's roof.\n\nMost low-floor trams carry the mechanical penalty of requiring [[bogie]]s to be fixed and unable to pivot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webak.upce.cz/~lata/konference/sbornik-clanky/79_86_zelingr_heptner.pdf |title=Zelingr, Heptner |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This creates undue wear on the tracks and wheels and reduces the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170646/http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-18 |title=\u010cVUT.cz \u2013 \u010capek, Kol\u00e1\u0159 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}</ref> Some manufacturers such as [[Citadis]] deal with the issue by introducing partially high floor trams.

Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of [[railroad switch|crossover points]] or Y-points.\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Prague Tram (8353420504).jpg\n | width1 = 167\n | caption1 = [[Uni-directional vehicle|Single-ended]] tram\n | footer= Trams are typically designed as uni-directional single-ended vehicles, or double-ended vehicles capable of being driven in both directions.\n | image2 = Pesa Jazz Plac Wile\u0144ski w Warszawie.JPG\n | caption2 = Double-ended tram\n | width2 = 200\n}}\nConversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at termini so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.\n\nA single-ended tram has operator's controls at only one end, and can safely be driven at speed in the forward direction but is also capable of reverse movement, typically at slower speed, using a small set of controls at the rear. The configuration of the doors is usually asymmetrical, favouring the side expected to be closest to the street [[kerb]] and [[footpath]]. At the end of a run, the tram must be turned around via a [[balloon loop]] or some other method, to face in the opposite direction for a return trip.\n\nIn addition, if overhead electrical power is fed from a [[trolley pole]], the direction of the trolley pole must be reversed at the end of the run, to ensure that the pole is \"pulled\" behind or \"trailing\" the vehicle, to avoid 'dewiring'. This was achieved by a member of the crew swinging the pole through 180 degrees (if there was only one pole) or lowering one pole and raising the other if there were two. More commonly nowadays, a bidirectional [[pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] may be used to feed power, eliminating the need for an extra procedure when reversing direction.\n\nTwo single-ended trams with doors on both sides may be coupled into a (semi-)permanently coupled [[married pair]] or [[Twin unit|twinset]], with operator's controls at each end of the combination. Such a setup is operated as if it were a double-ended tram, except that the operator must exit one vehicle and enter the other, when reversing at the end of the run.\n\n===Tourist tram===\n{{main|Heritage streetcar}}\n[[File:Port de soller to soller tram arp.jpg|thumb|left|A [[heritage streetcar|heritage tram]] operated by [[Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller]]. Heritage trams are operated in an effort to draw tourists and tram enthusiasts.]]\nMany systems have retained historical trams which will often run over parts of the system for tourists and tram enthusiasts.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, a number of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class]] run throughout each day in a set route which circles the Central Business District. They are primarily for the use of tourists, although often also used by regular commuters.\n\n===Tram-train===\n{{Main|Tram-train}}\n\nA [[tram-train]] is a [[Light rail|light-rail]] [[public transport]] system where trams run through from an urban tramway network to main-line [[railway]] lines which are shared with conventional trains. This allows passengers to travel from suburban areas into city-centre destinations without having to change from a train to a tram.\n\nTram-train operation uses vehicles such as the [[Flexity Link]] and Regio-[[Alstom Citadis]], which are suited for use on urban tram lines and also meet the necessary indication, power, and strength requirements for operation on main-line railways.\n\nIt has been primarily developed in Germanic countries, in particular Germany and Switzerland. [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn|Karlsruhe]] is a notable pioneer of the tram-train.\n\n===Contractors' mobile office===\nTwo former passenger cars from the [[Melbourne]] system were converted and used as mobile offices within the [[Preston Workshops]] between 1969 and 1974, by personnel from [[Commonwealth Engineering]] and [[Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]] who were connected with the construction of Melbourne's Z Class cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Rubber-tyred tram===\n{{See also|Rubber-tyred tram}}\n[[File:Tram roue.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubber tyres used for the [[Translohr]] [[rubber-tyred trams]]. Rubber-tyred trams are trams that are guided by fixed rail, but also make use of rubber tyres.]]\nA rubber-tyred tram is a [[guided bus]] which is guided by a fixed rail on the ground and uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit (GLT)]] and [[Translohr]]. The GLT \"trams\" are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the fixed rail when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr \"tram\" cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymtram.mashke.org/france/nancy/translohr_glt_en.html|title=Retrieved 21 September 2013.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWith the development of technologies for self-guided vehicles, it is now possible to dispense with the guide rail.

Overhead wires are used for both trams and light rail systems.]]\nThere are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way. Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called [[light rail]] but this does not always hold true. Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.\n\n===Controls===\nTrams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a [[locomotive]]-style controller which incorporate a [[dead man's switch]]. The success of the [[PCC streetcar]] had also seen trams use automobile-style [[Automobile pedal|foot controls]] allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.\n\n===Power supply===\nElectric trams use various devices to collect power from [[overhead line]]s. The most common device found today is the [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while some older systems use [[trolley pole]]s or [[bow collector]]s. [[Ground-level power supply]] has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses [[supercapacitor]]s; when an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large [[capacitor]] to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/lc/capac1.htm |title=An Introduction To Capacitors |publisher=Facstaff.bucknell.edu |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023326/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/LC/Capac1.htm |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A rather obsolete system for power supply is [[conduit current collection]].\n\nThe old tram systems in London, [[Manhattan]] (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a [[plough]]. It was called [[Conduit current collection]]. Washington's was the last of these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a [[third rail]] on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or [[ground-level power supply]]; the main example of this is the new tramway in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n====Ground-level power supply====\n{{Main|Ground-level power supply}}\n[[File:Bordeaux-aps+isolation&joint.jpg|thumb|A section of [[Ground-level power supply|APS]] track in [[Bordeaux]] with powered and neutral sections.]]\nA ground-level power supply system also known as Surface current collection or Alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.\n\nOlder systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.\n\nAlstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old [[Bordeaux]].<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature1096/ Allez le Tram from Railway-Technology.com]. Retrieved 15 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Route===\nRoute patterns vary greatly among the world's tram systems, leading to different [[network topologies]]. \n* Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these, such as those in [[Hong Kong Tramways|Hong Kong]], [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], [[Trams in Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Bergen Light Rail|Bergen]], still essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads. Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Midland Metro|Birmingham]], sometimes [[Cross-city route|joining them together]] by a section of street track through the city centre, as in [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]]. Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink#Lines|Second City Crossing]].\n* Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as [[Tramlink|London]] and [[Tramways in \u00cele-de-France|Paris]], have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then been linked by [[Circle route|ring lines]].\n* A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by [[BOGESTRA]] or the [[Silesian Interurbans]].\n* A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a [[downtown circulator]], as in [[Portland Streetcar|Portland]] or [[El Paso Streetcar|El Paso]].\n* Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in [[Trams in Stockholm|Stockholm]].\n\nThe resulting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout \u2013 such is the case in [[Trams in Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]. [[Bordeaux Tramway|Bordeaux]] and [[Montpellier tramway|Montpellier]] have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin]] being the prime example, owing to the fact that trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the ''tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen'' in [[Trams in Brussels|Brussels]]) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In [[Trams in Rome|Rome]], the remnant of the system comprises 3 isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than continue operating an existing one.\n\nIn some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstra\u00dfe in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.\n\nTram systems operate across national borders in [[Trams in Basel#Cross-border routes|Basel]] (from Switzerland into France and Germany) and [[Strasbourg tramway#Future extensions|Strasbourg]] (From France into Germany). It is planned to open a [[Hasselt \u2013 Maastricht tramway|line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands)]] in 2021.\n\n===Track===\n{{Main|Tramway track}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Rail profile#Grooved rail|Cross section]] of a grooved tram rail.]]\nTramway track can have different [[rail profile]]s to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle. They may be embedded into [[concrete]] for street-running operation, or use standard [[ballast]]ed track with [[railroad tie]]s on high-speed sections. A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into [[sod|grass turf]].\n\nTramway tracks use a [[Rail profile#Grooved rail|grooved rail]] with a [[groove (engineering)|groove]] designed for tramway or railway track in [[Road surface|pavement]] or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nIn narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid [[railroad switch|switches]], have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in [[Amsterdam]] on three short stretches (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024231501/http://adres.asp4all.nl/asp/get.asp?map_width=474&map_height=396&view=&laag=AmsterdamLite_Alleen_Kaart.mwf&xdl=Stadsplattegrond&xsl=Layout&straat=DAM&huisnummer=1&postcode_n=1012&postcode_a=JS&x_coord=121399&y_coord=487379&panning=true&point=&minx=120658.02971199994&maxx=120741.37028799993&miny=486378.4868480003&maxy=486448.11315200035&zoom=333 map detail]); this is known as interlaced or [[gauntlet track]]. There is a UK example of interlaced track on the [[Tramlink]], just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction. (See photo in [[Tramlink]] entry).\n\n===Track gauge===\nHistorically, the [[track gauge]] has had considerable variations, with [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now [[standard gauge]]. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.\n\nAnother factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout. Standard gauge also enables \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or [[loading gauge]] for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.\n\n===Tram stop===\n{{Main|Tram stop}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Tram lyon 04.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | footer= Tram stops can range from purpose-built, tram-exclusive facilities (left), to simple stops within a public road (right).\n | image2 = Stra\u00dfenbahnlinie 14, Oppenheimer Landstra\u00dfe.jpg\n | width2 = 180\n}}\nTram stops may be similar to [[bus stop]]s in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops may resemble to [[railway platform]]s, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard [[railway platform height]], as opposed to using steps at the doorway or [[low-floor tram]]s.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nApproximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.

Trams typically have longer service life than internal combustion buses.]]\n* Trams (and road public transport in general) can be much more efficient in terms of road usage than cars \u2013 one vehicle replaces about 40 cars (which take up a far larger area of road space).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humantransit.org/2012/09/the-photo-that-explains-almost-everything.html|title=Human Transit|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331233137/http://www.humantransit.org/2012/09/the-photo-that-explains-almost-everything.html|archivedate=31 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr257.pdf|title=Special Report 257: Making Transit Work<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=12 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808042854/http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr257.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* Vehicles run more [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|efficiently]] compared to similar vehicles that use rubber tyres, since the [[rolling resistance]] of steel is lower {{dubious|Steel_vs_Rubber_quote|date=January 2017}}.

This is especially compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.\n* In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]].\n* Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of [[heavy rail]]. In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.\n* Tramways can take advantage of old [[heavy rail]] alignments some examples include the [[Manchester Metrolink]] of which the [[Bury Line]] was part of the [[East Lancashire Railway]]. Other examples can be found in [[London]], [[Boston]], [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. They hence sometimes take advantage of high speed track while on train tracks.\n* Passengers can reach surface stations quicker than underground stations. Subjective safety at surface stations is often seen to be higher.\n* Trams can be tourist attractions in ways buses usually aren't.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n[[File:Midland Metro - Cyclist dismount sign - Andy Mabbett.jpg|thumb|A sign advising cyclists to dismount due to tram tracks.

A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification followed in 1897. All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the 1960 by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from Sukarno which saw tram network as \"antiquated\" and \"relic of colonial era\".\nThe other cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya and Semarang.\n\nSemarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, and it was essentially the inner suburb extension of Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network, where they already had extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties that hampered SJS railway company, Semarang tram network was closed down in 1940 (despite public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stocks were transferred to Surabaya tram network.\n\nSurabaya tram network was first built in 1886. Initially consist of steam tram only, but later another network of electric tram was added in 1923. They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era. The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the electrics before bowed out from service in 1978, making it as the very last urban steam tram service in the world to see service.\n\nIn 2012 there is a talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will be combined with the future monorail network. The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters. As in 2014 the project have entered tender phase.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\n[[File:Chlodwigplatz Stadtbahnhaltestelle 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] is the largest tram network in the [[European Union]].]]\nIn many European cities much tramway infrastructure was lost in the mid-20th century, though not always on the same scale as in other parts of the world such as North America.

However, Canadian cities excluding Toronto, removed their streetcar systems in the mid-20th century. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, light rail systems were introduced in Calgary and Edmonton; with another light rail system established in Ottawa in 2001. In the late 20th century, several Canadian locales restored portions of their defunct streetcar lines, operating them as a heritage feature for tourists. Heritage streetcar lines in Canada include the [[High Level Bridge Streetcar]] in Edmonton, the [[Nelson Electric Tramway]] in [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], and the [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]\n[[File:Portland Streetcar B-Loop car on Broadway Bridge (2016).jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 2001, the [[Portland Streetcar]] was the first (non-heritage) tram network established in North America in decades.]]\nPittsburgh had kept most of its streetcar system serving the city and many suburbs, making it the longest-lasting large-network streetcar system in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, most of Pittsburgh's surviving streetcar lines were converted to light rail in the 1980s. San Francisco's [[Muni Metro]] system is the largest surviving streetcar system in the United States, and has even revived previously closed streetcar lines such as the [[F Market & Wharves]] heritage streetcar line. In the late 20th century, several cities installed modern light rail systems, in part along the same corridors as their old streetcars systems, the first of these being the [[San Diego Trolley]] in [[San Diego]] in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, some cities in the United States brought back streetcars lines, including [[MATA Trolley|Memphis]], [[TECO Line Streetcar System|Tampa]], and [[Metro Streetcar|Little Rock]]; However, these streetcar systems were designed as heritage streetcar lines, and used vintage or replica-vintage vehicles.

Sydney reintroduced tram services in 1997 on a modern [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail network]], while Ballarat and Bendigo retained their trams as heritage systems. In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public transport. [[Portland, Victoria]], introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a Melbourne cable car dummy or [[cable grip|grip car]], driven by a hidden diesel motor, and two restored trailer cars. A completely new public transport system opened on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] on 20 July 2014, with a major extension completed in December 2017. The new system is known as the [[G:link]] and is the first tram/ light rail system in the state of Queensland since Brisbane closed its tram network in 1969.\n[[File:Canberra Light Rail construction in Harrison 2.jpg|left|thumb|Construction of [[light rail in Canberra]].

The local police did not recognise the ticket but images in newspapers led to it being identified as a Melbourne tram ticket. Serendipitously, the serial number on the ticket was intact. Victoria Police in Melbourne, acting as agents for The Met in London, contacted the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board. From the serial number, the M&MTB were able to tell which tram depot had issued the ticket, on what day and on which specific tram, and in which section of a particular route (North Balwyn). Police then interviewed regular commuters and discovered the identity of a man whom, they believed, had recently travelled to London. This led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.

The second film, ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', has tram 27 living in the garden, near to Herbie. 27 plays a major part in the plot of the film.\n\n===Literature===\n* One of the earliest literary references to trams occurs on the second page of [[Henry James]]'s novel ''[[The Europeans]]'':\n\n<blockquote>From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stood\u2014such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low, omnibus, painted in brilliant colours, and decorated apparently with jingling bells, attached to a species of [[Groove (machining)|groove]] in the [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling, bouncing, and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses.</blockquote>\n\n: Published in 1878, the novel is set in the 1840s, though horse trams were not introduced in Boston till the 1850s. Note how the tram's efficiency surprises the European visitor; how two \"remarkably small\" horses sufficed to draw the \"huge\" tramcar.\n\n* Joseph Conrad described Amsterdam's trams in chapter 14 of ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906): \"From afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and disappearing in the opening between the buildings, like little toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared no bigger than children.\"\n* In episode 6 (\"[[Hades]]\") of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1918), the party on the way to Paddy Dignam's funeral in a horse-drawn carriage idly debates the merits of various tramway improvements:\n{{quote|\nI can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.\n\nInstead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite so. They ought to.\n\nYes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought is to have [[Tram#Hearse trams|municipal funeral trams]] like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don't you see what I mean?\n:\u2013 O that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.

Historically the term '''electric street railways''' was also used in the United States. In the United States, the term ''tram'' has sometimes been used for rubber-tired [[trackless train]]s, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.\n\nTram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and [[rapid transit]] trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] sliding on an [[overhead line]]; older systems may use a [[trolley pole]] or a [[bow collector]]. In some cases, a [[contact shoe]] on a [[third rail]] is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems\u2014electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry [[freight (rail)|freight]].\n\nTrams are now commonly included in the wider term \"[[light rail]]\",<ref>Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 \u00a9 HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014</ref> which also includes [[grade-separated]] systems. Some trams, known as [[tram-train]]s, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to [[interurban]] systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features.\n\nOne of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low [[rolling resistance]] of metal wheels on [[steel]] rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Problems included the high [[total cost of ownership]] of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence in recent years.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\nThe English terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' are derived from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word {{lang|sco|tram}},<ref>{{cite web|url = https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/tram_n_2 |title = tram, n.<sup>2</sup> |work = A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (up to 1700)|publisher = Dictionary of the Scots Language}}</ref> referring respectively to a type of truck ([[goods wagon]] or freight [[railroad car]]) used in [[coal mining|coal mines]] and the tracks on which they ran. The word ''tram'' probably derived from [[Middle Dutch|Middle Flemish]] {{lang |dum|trame}} (\"beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung\"). The identical word {{lang|fr|la trame}} with the meaning \"crossbeam\" is also used in the [[French language]]. Etymologists believe that the word ''tram'' refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more wear-resistant tracks made of iron and, later, steel.<ref>Duden-das Herkunftsw\u00f6rterbuch-Etymologie der deutschen Sprache-Mannheim 2001 p859</ref> The word ''Tram-car'' is attested from 1873.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061427/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Go by Streetcar sign - Portland Oregon.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] that reads \"go by streetcar.\" Trams are typically called streetcars in North America.]]\nAlthough the terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' have been adopted by many languages, they are not used universally in English; North Americans prefer ''streetcar'', ''trolley'', or ''trolleycar''. The term ''streetcar'' is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to [[horsecar]]s. When electrification came, Americans began to speak of ''trolleycars'' or later, ''trolleys''. A widely held belief holds the word to derive from the ''troller'' (said to derive from the words ''traveler'' and ''roller''), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the [[overhead wire]]s;<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

Middleton|Middleton, William D.]] (1967). ''The Time of the Trolley'', p. 60. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. {{ISBN|0-89024-013-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe alternative North American term 'trolley' may strictly speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be applied to cable cars, or [[conduit car]]s that instead draw power from an underground supply. Conventional diesel [[bus|tourist buses]] decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called ''trolleys'' in the US ([[tourist trolley]]). Furthering confusion, the term ''tram'' has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed [[trackless train|segmented vehicles on rubber tires]] generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the [[Universal Studios Backlot Tour|Universal Studios backlot tour]] and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]].\n\nAlthough the use of the term ''trolley'' for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the ''[[trolleybus]]'', a rubber-tyred vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called ''trackless trolleys'' (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply ''trolleys'' (in the UK, as well as the [[Pacific Northwest]], including [[Seattle]], and [[Vancouver]]).\n\nThe [[New South Wales]] government in Australia has decided to use the term \"light rail\" for their trams.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of trams}}\n\nThe history of trams, streetcars or trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century. It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used.\n\n===Horse-drawn===\n{{Main|Horsecar}}\n[[File:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn tram operated by [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]], 1870.

Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street railway running in [[Baltimore]] as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] developed by the Irish coach builder [[John Stephenson (coachbuilder)|John Stephenson]], in New York City which began service in the year 1832.{{sfn|Dunbar|1967|pp=16\u201317}}<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co].

The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|title=Transportation Technology|website=www.siemens.com|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|archive-date=29 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:The last of the Horse Drawn Carriages.JPG|thumb|Horse-drawn trams continued to be used in [[New York City]] until 1917.]]\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century.

The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Trams in Rockhampton|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n===Cable-hauled===\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[File:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums of the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway]]\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Cable cars in Chicago|Chicago]], having been built in stages between 1859 and 1892. New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bowery boys : adventures In Old New York : an unconventional exploration of Manhattan's historic neighborhoods, secret spots and colorful characters |publisher=Ulysses Press |isbn=1612435769 |page=179 |date=18 April 2016 }}</ref> Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n[[File:Melbourne\u2019s first cable tram.jpg|thumb|The first [[Melbourne cable tramway system|cable car service in Melbourne]], 1885. From its founding to 1940, Melbourne operated one of the largest cable car networks in the world.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track.

Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n[[File:San Francisco Cable Car MC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[San Francisco cable cars|San Francisco cable car]] in 2008. The cable car's effectiveness in hilly environments partially explains its continued use in San Francisco.]]\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n===Gas===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1921\u20131951); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

Derailed electric trams are a hazard, as it requires contact with the rails for the current's return path.]]\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British terminology, such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs.

The [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] was a case study of the decline of trams in the United States. In the 21st century, trams have been re-introduced in cities where they had been closed down for decades (such as [[Tramlink]] in London), or kept in heritage use (such as [[Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4g City]] in Stockholm).

The motivation now is to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and damage to road surfaces in city centres.\n\nOne recent proposal to bring cargo tramways back into wider use was the plan by [[City Cargo Amsterdam]] to reintroduce them into the city of [[Amsterdam]]. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of [[lorries]] (5,000) unloading in the [[inner city]] during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a \"hub\" where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small [[Shipping container|containers]] to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of \u20ac100&nbsp;million in a [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] of 52 cargo trams distributing from four peripheral \"cross docks\" to 15 inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be {{convert|30|ft|m|2}} long with 12 [[axle]]s and a [[Cargo|payload]] of {{convert|30|t|ST LT|1|lk=on}}. On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;a.m. and two per hour between 11&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;p.m. With each unloading operation taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour. In early 2009 the scheme was suspended owing to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis]] impeding fund-raising.<ref>\"Samenwest\"  ''5 December 2006, NOS3 television news 7 March 2007, ''Amsterdams Stadblad 4 June 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|title=Delivering Case studies - Eltis goods by cargo tram in Amsterdam (Netherlands) |website=www.eltis.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820161058/http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Dog car===\nIn 1937, Melbourne passenger tramcar C class number 30 was converted for transporting dogs and their owners to the [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]].

This made passenger access easier, reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. These cars were frequently referred to as \"drop-centres\". It is believed that the design first originated in [[Trams in Christchurch|Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1906 when Boon & Co Ltd. built 26 such trams in three series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|title=Tramway Historical Society \u2013 Welcome|website=www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406015134/http://ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|archivedate=6 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A number of these trams have been preserved.

This allows them to load passengers, including those in [[wheelchair]]s or with [[Baby transport|perambulator]]s directly from low-rise platforms that are not much more than raised footpaths/sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive [[wheelchair lift]]s, while at the same time making boarding faster and easier for other passengers.

In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about 18&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;inches above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complicated electronic steering of the [[traction motor]]s.

Three of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class trams]] were converted to restaurant tram since 1983. All three often run in tandem and there are usually multiple meal sittings. Bookings often close months in advance. As from mid-October 2018, Melbourne's restaurant trams were temporarily taken off the road after failing a [[Yarra Trams]]' safety assessment due to badly weathered underlying structures. Until the trams again meet safety standards, the trams are offering stationary dining.<ref>''Railway Digest'', journal of the [[Australian Railway Historical Society]], December 2018</ref> As at October 2019, they were still not running.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/melbourne-s-famous-tram-restaurant-sues-yarra-trams-20191015-p530za.html</ref>\n\nBistro trams with buffets operated on ordinary services between 1924 and 2014 on the U76 [[Rheinbahn]] route between [[Krefeld]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linied.net/aktuelles_2014/2014_bistro.html|title=Linie D - Aktuelles - Einsatz der Rheinbahn-Speisewagen endet|website=www.linied.net|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> and for a short period in 1911 on the Amsterdam-Zandvoort line.\n\n[[Helsinki]] in Finland has a [[Sp\u00e5rakoff|pub tram]]. [[Frankfurt]], Germany, has a tourist circle line called \"Ebbelwei-Express\", in which the traditional local drink \"Apfelwein\" (locally called \"Ebbelwei\", a type of [[hard cider]]) is served.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sightseeing in Frankfurt with the Ebbelwei-Express |url=http://www.ebbelwei-express.com/html/index_e.html |work=Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt am Main |accessdate=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025000/http://www.ebbelwei-express.com/html/index_e.html |archivedate=11 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Single-ended versus double-ended===\nA double-ended tram has an operator's cab and controls at each end of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of [[railroad switch|crossover points]] or Y-points.\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Prague Tram (8353420504).jpg\n | width1 = 167\n | caption1 = [[Uni-directional vehicle|Single-ended]] tram\n | footer= Trams are typically designed as uni-directional single-ended vehicles, or double-ended vehicles capable of being driven in both directions.\n | image2 = Pesa Jazz Plac Wile\u0144ski w Warszawie.JPG\n | caption2 = Double-ended tram\n | width2 = 200\n}}\nConversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at termini so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.\n\nA single-ended tram has operator's controls at only one end, and can safely be driven at speed in the forward direction but is also capable of reverse movement, typically at slower speed, using a small set of controls at the rear. The configuration of the doors is usually asymmetrical, favouring the side expected to be closest to the street [[kerb]] and [[footpath]]. At the end of a run, the tram must be turned around via a [[balloon loop]] or some other method, to face in the opposite direction for a return trip.\n\nIn addition, if overhead electrical power is fed from a [[trolley pole]], the direction of the trolley pole must be reversed at the end of the run, to ensure that the pole is \"pulled\" behind or \"trailing\" the vehicle, to avoid 'dewiring'. This was achieved by a member of the crew swinging the pole through 180 degrees (if there was only one pole) or lowering one pole and raising the other if there were two. More commonly nowadays, a bidirectional [[pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] may be used to feed power, eliminating the need for an extra procedure when reversing direction.\n\nTwo single-ended trams with doors on both sides may be coupled into a (semi-)permanently coupled [[married pair]] or [[Twin unit|twinset]], with operator's controls at each end of the combination. Such a setup is operated as if it were a double-ended tram, except that the operator must exit one vehicle and enter the other, when reversing at the end of the run.\n\n===Tourist tram===\n{{main|Heritage streetcar}}\n[[File:Port de soller to soller tram arp.jpg|thumb|left|A [[heritage streetcar|heritage tram]] operated by [[Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller]]. Heritage trams are operated in an effort to draw tourists and tram enthusiasts.]]\nMany systems have retained historical trams which will often run over parts of the system for tourists and tram enthusiasts.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, a number of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class]] run throughout each day in a set route which circles the Central Business District. They are primarily for the use of tourists, although often also used by regular commuters.\n\n===Tram-train===\n{{Main|Tram-train}}\n\nA [[tram-train]] is a [[Light rail|light-rail]] [[public transport]] system where trams run through from an urban tramway network to main-line [[railway]] lines which are shared with conventional trains. This allows passengers to travel from suburban areas into city-centre destinations without having to change from a train to a tram.\n\nTram-train operation uses vehicles such as the [[Flexity Link]] and Regio-[[Alstom Citadis]], which are suited for use on urban tram lines and also meet the necessary indication, power, and strength requirements for operation on main-line railways.\n\nIt has been primarily developed in Germanic countries, in particular Germany and Switzerland. [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn|Karlsruhe]] is a notable pioneer of the tram-train.\n\n===Contractors' mobile office===\nTwo former passenger cars from the [[Melbourne]] system were converted and used as mobile offices within the [[Preston Workshops]] between 1969 and 1974, by personnel from [[Commonwealth Engineering]] and [[Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]] who were connected with the construction of Melbourne's Z Class cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Rubber-tyred tram===\n{{See also|Rubber-tyred tram}}\n[[File:Tram roue.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubber tyres used for the [[Translohr]] [[rubber-tyred trams]]. Rubber-tyred trams are trams that are guided by fixed rail, but also make use of rubber tyres.]]\nA rubber-tyred tram is a [[guided bus]] which is guided by a fixed rail on the ground and uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit (GLT)]] and [[Translohr]]. The GLT \"trams\" are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the fixed rail when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr \"tram\" cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymtram.mashke.org/france/nancy/translohr_glt_en.html|title=Retrieved 21 September 2013.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWith the development of technologies for self-guided vehicles, it is now possible to dispense with the guide rail.  The [[Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit]] system planned for Zouzhou in China follows a virtual track.\n\n===Other designs===\n====Modern styling====\nThe ''[[Eurotram]]'' series was developed by [[Socimi]] of Italy. It is used by [[Strasbourg]], [[Milan]], and [[Porto]]. The Eurotram has a modern design that makes it look almost as much like a train as a tram, and has large windows along its entire length.<ref>[http://world.nycsubway.org/eu/pt/portometro.html Porto:Metro from NYCsubway.org].

Overhead wires are used for both trams and light rail systems.]]\nThere are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way. Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called [[light rail]] but this does not always hold true. Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.\n\n===Controls===\nTrams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a [[locomotive]]-style controller which incorporate a [[dead man's switch]]. The success of the [[PCC streetcar]] had also seen trams use automobile-style [[Automobile pedal|foot controls]] allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.\n\n===Power supply===\nElectric trams use various devices to collect power from [[overhead line]]s. The most common device found today is the [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while some older systems use [[trolley pole]]s or [[bow collector]]s. [[Ground-level power supply]] has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses [[supercapacitor]]s; when an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large [[capacitor]] to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/lc/capac1.htm |title=An Introduction To Capacitors |publisher=Facstaff.bucknell.edu |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023326/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/LC/Capac1.htm |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A rather obsolete system for power supply is [[conduit current collection]].\n\nThe old tram systems in London, [[Manhattan]] (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a [[plough]]. It was called [[Conduit current collection]]. Washington's was the last of these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a [[third rail]] on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or [[ground-level power supply]]; the main example of this is the new tramway in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n====Ground-level power supply====\n{{Main|Ground-level power supply}}\n[[File:Bordeaux-aps+isolation&joint.jpg|thumb|A section of [[Ground-level power supply|APS]] track in [[Bordeaux]] with powered and neutral sections.]]\nA ground-level power supply system also known as Surface current collection or Alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.\n\nOlder systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.\n\nAlstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old [[Bordeaux]].<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature1096/ Allez le Tram from Railway-Technology.com]. Retrieved 15 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Route===\nRoute patterns vary greatly among the world's tram systems, leading to different [[network topologies]]. \n* Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these, such as those in [[Hong Kong Tramways|Hong Kong]], [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], [[Trams in Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Bergen Light Rail|Bergen]], still essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads. Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Midland Metro|Birmingham]], sometimes [[Cross-city route|joining them together]] by a section of street track through the city centre, as in [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]]. Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink#Lines|Second City Crossing]].\n* Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as [[Tramlink|London]] and [[Tramways in \u00cele-de-France|Paris]], have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then been linked by [[Circle route|ring lines]].\n* A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by [[BOGESTRA]] or the [[Silesian Interurbans]].\n* A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a [[downtown circulator]], as in [[Portland Streetcar|Portland]] or [[El Paso Streetcar|El Paso]].\n* Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in [[Trams in Stockholm|Stockholm]].\n\nThe resulting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout \u2013 such is the case in [[Trams in Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]. [[Bordeaux Tramway|Bordeaux]] and [[Montpellier tramway|Montpellier]] have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin]] being the prime example, owing to the fact that trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the ''tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen'' in [[Trams in Brussels|Brussels]]) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In [[Trams in Rome|Rome]], the remnant of the system comprises 3 isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than continue operating an existing one.\n\nIn some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstra\u00dfe in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.\n\nTram systems operate across national borders in [[Trams in Basel#Cross-border routes|Basel]] (from Switzerland into France and Germany) and [[Strasbourg tramway#Future extensions|Strasbourg]] (From France into Germany). It is planned to open a [[Hasselt \u2013 Maastricht tramway|line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands)]] in 2021.\n\n===Track===\n{{Main|Tramway track}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Rail profile#Grooved rail|Cross section]] of a grooved tram rail.]]\nTramway track can have different [[rail profile]]s to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle. They may be embedded into [[concrete]] for street-running operation, or use standard [[ballast]]ed track with [[railroad tie]]s on high-speed sections. A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into [[sod|grass turf]].\n\nTramway tracks use a [[Rail profile#Grooved rail|grooved rail]] with a [[groove (engineering)|groove]] designed for tramway or railway track in [[Road surface|pavement]] or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nIn narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid [[railroad switch|switches]], have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in [[Amsterdam]] on three short stretches (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024231501/http://adres.asp4all.nl/asp/get.asp?map_width=474&map_height=396&view=&laag=AmsterdamLite_Alleen_Kaart.mwf&xdl=Stadsplattegrond&xsl=Layout&straat=DAM&huisnummer=1&postcode_n=1012&postcode_a=JS&x_coord=121399&y_coord=487379&panning=true&point=&minx=120658.02971199994&maxx=120741.37028799993&miny=486378.4868480003&maxy=486448.11315200035&zoom=333 map detail]); this is known as interlaced or [[gauntlet track]]. There is a UK example of interlaced track on the [[Tramlink]], just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction. (See photo in [[Tramlink]] entry).\n\n===Track gauge===\nHistorically, the [[track gauge]] has had considerable variations, with [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now [[standard gauge]]. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.\n\nAnother factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout. Standard gauge also enables \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or [[loading gauge]] for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.\n\n===Tram stop===\n{{Main|Tram stop}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Tram lyon 04.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | footer= Tram stops can range from purpose-built, tram-exclusive facilities (left), to simple stops within a public road (right).\n | image2 = Stra\u00dfenbahnlinie 14, Oppenheimer Landstra\u00dfe.jpg\n | width2 = 180\n}}\nTram stops may be similar to [[bus stop]]s in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops may resemble to [[railway platform]]s, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard [[railway platform height]], as opposed to using steps at the doorway or [[low-floor tram]]s.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nApproximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.

This is especially compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.\n* In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]].\n* Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of [[heavy rail]]. In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.\n* Tramways can take advantage of old [[heavy rail]] alignments some examples include the [[Manchester Metrolink]] of which the [[Bury Line]] was part of the [[East Lancashire Railway]]. Other examples can be found in [[London]], [[Boston]], [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].

In the past 20 years their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or light rail systems in cities that had discarded this form of transport. There have also been some new tram systems in cities that never previously had them.\n\n''Tramways with tramcars'' ([[British English]]) or ''street railways with streetcars'' ([[North American English]]) were common throughout the industrialised world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but they had disappeared from most British, Canadian, French and US cities by the mid-20th century.<ref>[http://lda.ucdavis.edu/LDA191/Course%20Handouts%20&%20Readings/08-ULI_Streetcars.pdf Jeffrey Spivak: Streetcars are back from Landscape Architecture Department, UC Davis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225095245/http://lda.ucdavis.edu/LDA191/Course%20Handouts%20%26%20Readings/08-ULI_Streetcars.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}.

New systems have been built in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Australia and many other countries.\n\nIn Milan, Italy, the old \"[[Peter Witt streetcar|Ventotto]]\" trams are considered by its inhabitants a \"symbol\" of the city.

The [[Toronto streetcar system]] had similarly become an iconic symbol of the city, operating the largest network in the Americas as well as the only large-scale tram system in Canada (not including light rail systems, or heritage lines).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|title=Streetcars are our neglected stars|work=The Toronto Star|last=Keenan|first=Edward|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915120009/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|archivedate=15 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|title=Toronto rides new streetcars to its urban future|work=The Toronto Star|first=Christopher|last=Hume|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909021538/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Major tram and light rail systems===\n{{main|List of largest town tramway systems}}\n====Current systems====\n[[File:Melbourne tram extension proposals.gif|thumb|Map of Melbourne's tram system in 2009 (with proposed extension).

However the 21st century has seen a resurgence in development of tram transport as China struggles with urban traffic congestion and pollution with at least 15 systems operating. Hong Kong has an exclusive fleet of double-decker trams. As of 2017, [[Chengdu]], [[Sanya]], [[Wuyishan, Fujian|Wuyishan]] and [[Haikou]] have new tram systems under construction.

The tram declined in popularity through the remaining years of the 1930s and during the 1960s many of the remaining operational tramways were shut down or converted into commuter railway lines.\n\nIn India, trams are in operation only in [[Kolkata]] ang gauge up to 30 km across the city.

This system commenced operations about 1900 and was discontinued by 1960. However, a new tram system is in the process of being brought to Colombo as part of the plan of [[Western Region Megapolis]].\n\nThe 13-kilometre-long [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] system began operation in August 2011 and is currently being extended, with the full system expected to be in operation by 2023. \n\nA significant portion of it will be underground. A light rail system for [[Beersheba]] is also currently planned.\n\n\nOther countries with discontinued tram systems include Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan and Vietnam. However, a tram system is planned for construction in [[Gwadar]], Pakistan where construction started in late 2011. Trams are also under construction in [[DHA City, Karachi]]. In China the cities of Beijing, Zhuhai, Nanjing and Shenzhen are planning tram networks for the future.\n\n\n[Historic]\n\nIndonesia\n\nIn Batavia (now Jakarta), the capital of the former Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies, a horse tram service started in 1869. A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification followed in 1897. All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the 1960 by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from Sukarno which saw tram network as \"antiquated\" and \"relic of colonial era\".\nThe other cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya and Semarang.\n\nSemarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, and it was essentially the inner suburb extension of Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network, where they already had extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties that hampered SJS railway company, Semarang tram network was closed down in 1940 (despite public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stocks were transferred to Surabaya tram network.\n\nSurabaya tram network was first built in 1886. Initially consist of steam tram only, but later another network of electric tram was added in 1923. They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era. The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the electrics before bowed out from service in 1978, making it as the very last urban steam tram service in the world to see service.\n\nIn 2012 there is a talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will be combined with the future monorail network. The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters. As in 2014 the project have entered tender phase.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\n[[File:Chlodwigplatz Stadtbahnhaltestelle 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] is the largest tram network in the [[European Union]].]]\nIn many European cities much tramway infrastructure was lost in the mid-20th century, though not always on the same scale as in other parts of the world such as North America. Most of Central and Eastern Europe retained the majority of its tramway systems and it is here that the largest and busiest tram systems in the world are found.\n\nWhereas most systems and vehicles in the tram sector are found in Central and Eastern Europe, in the 1960s and 1970s, tram systems were shut down in many places in Western Europe, however urban transportation has been experiencing a sustained long running revival since the 1990s.

Sydney reintroduced tram services in 1997 on a modern [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail network]], while Ballarat and Bendigo retained their trams as heritage systems. In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public transport. [[Portland, Victoria]], introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a Melbourne cable car dummy or [[cable grip|grip car]], driven by a hidden diesel motor, and two restored trailer cars. A completely new public transport system opened on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] on 20 July 2014, with a major extension completed in December 2017.

Police then interviewed regular commuters and discovered the identity of a man whom, they believed, had recently travelled to London. This led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. Decades after the event, the M&MTB were still citing the incident in training courses as a reason for tram conductors, etc., to keep proper and efficient records.\n\n==Tram modelling==\n{{see also|Rail transport modelling}}\n[[File:Blackburn and East Lancs MRS - 44th annual exhibition - DSC03803.JPG|thumb|A model of a town with a [[Rail transport modelling|tram model]] built into it.]]\nModel trams are popular in [[HO scale]] (1:87) and [[O scale]] (1:48 in the US and generally 1:43,5 and 1:45 in Europe and Asia).

Note how the tram's efficiency surprises the European visitor; how two \"remarkably small\" horses sufficed to draw the \"huge\" tramcar.\n\n* Joseph Conrad described Amsterdam's trams in chapter 14 of ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906): \"From afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and disappearing in the opening between the buildings, like little toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared no bigger than children.\"\n* In episode 6 (\"[[Hades]]\") of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1918), the party on the way to Paddy Dignam's funeral in a horse-drawn carriage idly debates the merits of various tramway improvements:\n{{quote|\nI can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.

It was an attempt by Franco-Spanish force dispatched under Captain [[Julien Cosmao]] to retake [[Diamond Rock]], at the entrance to the bay leading to [[Fort-de-France]], from the British forces that had occupied it over a year before.\n\nThe French in [[Martinique]] had been unable to oust the defenders from the strategically important rock, and the British garrison was able to control access to Fort-de-France Bay, firing on ships attempting to enter it with guns they had placed on the cliffs. The arrival of a large combined Franco-Spanish fleet in May changed the strategic situation. The French commander, [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve]], had vague orders to attack British possessions in the Caribbean, but instead waited at Martinique for clearer instructions. He was finally persuaded to authorise an assault on the British position, and a Franco-Spanish [[flotilla]] was dispatched to storm the rock. Already short of water, the defenders held on in the summit for several days, while the French, who had neglected to bring scaling ladders, could make little headway.\n\nThe British, short of both water and ammunition, eventually negotiated the surrender of the rock after several days under fire. As Diamond Rock was legally considered a Royal Navy vessel, and the commander was legally \"captain\" of it, after repatriation, he was tried by [[court-martial]] (as the law dictated in any case where a captain loses his ship, regardless of the cause), but was honourably acquitted.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Diamond Rock is fortified===\nDiamond Rock had been fortified in January 1804 on the orders of Commodore [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]]. Hood had been active in the West Indies, protecting British convoys from French [[privateer]]s issuing out of the two major naval bases the French retained in the Caribbean, at [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]].<ref name=\"Adkins126\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=126}}</ref> The privateers had captured a number of valuable cargoes and were diverting British warships to protect the merchant fleets. Hood decided to blockade Martinique, and thus curtail the privateers and intercept supplies destined for the French garrison.<ref name=\"Adkins126\"/> Patrolling off the bay at the southern end of the island, in which one of Martinique's two main ports, Fort-de-France, was located, Hood saw that if Diamond Rock could be occupied, it would allow the British to effectively control the shipping approaching the ports on the western side, as the currents around the island made the easiest approaches mean passing within sight of Diamond Rock.<ref name=\"Adkins130\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=127}}</ref>\n[[File:Fort Diamond cannon.jpg|thumb|left|A cannon is hauled up to the summit of the rock suspended by a cable lashed to the base of ''Centaur''{{'}}s mainmast]]\n\nHood reconnoitered Diamond Rock and considered it excellently defensible, with the only possible landing site being on the western side. He wrote that 'thirty riflemen will keep the hill against ten thousand ... it is a perfect naval post.'<ref name=\"Adkins130\"/> A party of men were landed on 7 January 1804, from Hood's flagship {{HMS|Centaur|1797|6}}, under the command of ''Centaur''{{'}}s first lieutenant [[James Wilkes Maurice]]. They promptly fortified the small cove they had landed at with their [[launch (boat)|launch's]] 24-pounder, and established forges and artificers' workshops in a cave at the base of the rock.<ref name=\"Adkins130\"/> After fixing ladders and ropes to scale the sheer sides of the rock, they were able to access the summit and began to establish messes and sleeping areas in a number of small caves.<ref name=\"Adkins128\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=128}}</ref> Bats were driven out by burning bales of hay, and a space was cleared by blasting at the top of the rock in order to establish a battery.<ref name=\"Adkins128\"/> In February a number of guns were transferred over from ''Centaur'', with two 24-pounders being installed in a cave near sea level, another 24-pounder halfway up the rock, and two 18-pounders in the battery at the top. In addition to this the men had use of a number of boats, with one armed with a 24-pounder [[carronade]], which were used to intercept enemy ships.<ref name=\"Adkins128\"/>\n\nMarshall's ''Naval Biography'', when describing the process of hauling the guns to the summit, recorded that {{quote|Lieutenant Maurice having succeeded in scrambling up the side of the rock ..., and fastened one end of an 8-inch hawser to a pinnacle, the viol-block was converted into a traveller, with a purchase-block lashed thereto, and the other end of the hawser set up, as a jack-stay, round the ''Centaur''{{'}}s main-mast. The gun being slung to the viol, the purchase-fall was brought to the [[capstan (nautical)|capstern]]. In this manner the desired object was effected in the course of a week, during which time Lieutenant Maurice and the working party on shore suffered most dreadfully from excessive heat and fatigue, being constantly exposed to the sun, and frequently obliged to lower themselves down over immense precipices to attend the ascent of the guns, and bear them off from the innumerable projections against which they swung whenever the ship took a shear...<ref name=\"Tracy245\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=245}}</ref>}}\n\n===French reactions===\nDespite the vulnerability of both ''Centaur'' and the Rock to a French gunboat attack while the process of fortification was being carried out, the French neglected to act. The governor of Martinique, [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse]] ordered work to begin on building a road to the coast opposite the rock, and the establishment of a battery there, but the British were forewarned by the black population of the island who were largely sympathetic to the British.<ref name=\"Adkins129\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=129}}</ref> A party was sent onshore, which succeeded in capturing the engineer sent to construct the battery, and three of his men.

Gravina wanted to invade the island of [[History of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], under British rule since its capture from the Spanish a couple of years before. Villeneuve left Fort-de-France on 5 June, and on 7 June two French frigates sighted a convoy of 16 British merchants, and Villeneuve signalled general chase. The Spanish 80-gun ship of the line ''Argonauta'' and the two frigates chased down and captured fifteen of the sixteen merchants. The convoy was laden with sugar, rum, coffee, cotton and other products. From them he learnt that Nelson had arrived in the West Indies, in hot pursuit of Villeneuve.

It was an attempt by Franco-Spanish force dispatched under Captain [[Julien Cosmao]] to retake [[Diamond Rock]], at the entrance to the bay leading to [[Fort-de-France]], from the British forces that had occupied it over a year before.\n\nThe French in [[Martinique]] had been unable to oust the defenders from the strategically important rock, and the British garrison was able to control access to Fort-de-France Bay, firing on ships attempting to enter it with guns they had placed on the cliffs. The arrival of a large combined Franco-Spanish fleet in May changed the strategic situation. The French commander, [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve]], had vague orders to attack British possessions in the Caribbean, but instead waited at Martinique for clearer instructions. He was finally persuaded to authorise an assault on the British position, and a Franco-Spanish [[flotilla]] was dispatched to storm the rock. Already short of water, the defenders held on in the summit for several days, while the French, who had neglected to bring scaling ladders, could make little headway.\n\nThe British, short of both water and ammunition, eventually negotiated the surrender of the rock after several days under fire. As Diamond Rock was legally considered a Royal Navy vessel, and the commander was legally \"captain\" of it, after repatriation, he was tried by [[court-martial]] (as the law dictated in any case where a captain loses his ship, regardless of the cause), but was honourably acquitted.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Diamond Rock is fortified===\nDiamond Rock had been fortified in January 1804 on the orders of Commodore [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]]. Hood had been active in the West Indies, protecting British convoys from French [[privateer]]s issuing out of the two major naval bases the French retained in the Caribbean, at [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]].<ref name=\"Adkins126\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=126}}</ref> The privateers had captured a number of valuable cargoes and were diverting British warships to protect the merchant fleets. Hood decided to blockade Martinique, and thus curtail the privateers and intercept supplies destined for the French garrison.<ref name=\"Adkins126\"/> Patrolling off the bay at the southern end of the island, in which one of Martinique's two main ports, Fort-de-France, was located, Hood saw that if Diamond Rock could be occupied, it would allow the British to effectively control the shipping approaching the ports on the western side, as the currents around the island made the easiest approaches mean passing within sight of Diamond Rock.<ref name=\"Adkins130\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=127}}</ref>\n[[File:Fort Diamond cannon.jpg|thumb|left|A cannon is hauled up to the summit of the rock suspended by a cable lashed to the base of ''Centaur''{{'}}s mainmast]]\n\nHood reconnoitered Diamond Rock and considered it excellently defensible, with the only possible landing site being on the western side. He wrote that 'thirty riflemen will keep the hill against ten thousand ... it is a perfect naval post.'<ref name=\"Adkins130\"/> A party of men were landed on 7 January 1804, from Hood's flagship {{HMS|Centaur|1797|6}}, under the command of ''Centaur''{{'}}s first lieutenant [[James Wilkes Maurice]]. They promptly fortified the small cove they had landed at with their [[launch (boat)|launch's]] 24-pounder, and established forges and artificers' workshops in a cave at the base of the rock.<ref name=\"Adkins130\"/> After fixing ladders and ropes to scale the sheer sides of the rock, they were able to access the summit and began to establish messes and sleeping areas in a number of small caves.<ref name=\"Adkins128\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=128}}</ref> Bats were driven out by burning bales of hay, and a space was cleared by blasting at the top of the rock in order to establish a battery.<ref name=\"Adkins128\"/> In February a number of guns were transferred over from ''Centaur'', with two 24-pounders being installed in a cave near sea level, another 24-pounder halfway up the rock, and two 18-pounders in the battery at the top. In addition to this the men had use of a number of boats, with one armed with a 24-pounder [[carronade]], which were used to intercept enemy ships.<ref name=\"Adkins128\"/>\n\nMarshall's ''Naval Biography'', when describing the process of hauling the guns to the summit, recorded that {{quote|Lieutenant Maurice having succeeded in scrambling up the side of the rock ..., and fastened one end of an 8-inch hawser to a pinnacle, the viol-block was converted into a traveller, with a purchase-block lashed thereto, and the other end of the hawser set up, as a jack-stay, round the ''Centaur''{{'}}s main-mast. The gun being slung to the viol, the purchase-fall was brought to the [[capstan (nautical)|capstern]]. In this manner the desired object was effected in the course of a week, during which time Lieutenant Maurice and the working party on shore suffered most dreadfully from excessive heat and fatigue, being constantly exposed to the sun, and frequently obliged to lower themselves down over immense precipices to attend the ascent of the guns, and bear them off from the innumerable projections against which they swung whenever the ship took a shear...<ref name=\"Tracy245\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=245}}</ref>}}\n\n===French reactions===\nDespite the vulnerability of both ''Centaur'' and the Rock to a French gunboat attack while the process of fortification was being carried out, the French neglected to act. The governor of Martinique, [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse]] ordered work to begin on building a road to the coast opposite the rock, and the establishment of a battery there, but the British were forewarned by the black population of the island who were largely sympathetic to the British.<ref name=\"Adkins129\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=129}}</ref> A party was sent onshore, which succeeded in capturing the engineer sent to construct the battery, and three of his men.

Four Spanish gunboats from the ships ''San Rafael'', ''Argonauta'', ''Espa\u00f1a'' and ''Firme'' participated in the attack, with a Spanish gunboat being the first to disembark troops on the rock under fire from the British positions.<ref name=\"Henderson302\"/><ref name =\"Miguel Agustin principe\">{{cite book |last=Miguel Agustin Principe |title=Narration of the Peninsular war, Madrid 1842\u20131847.

By 2 June, with his ammunition almost exhausted and water supplies running critically short, Maurice opened negotiations.<ref name=\"Henderson303\">{{cite book |last=Henderson |title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs|page=303}}</ref>\n\nAt four o'clock that afternoon flag of truce was displayed and a senior French officer was dispatched in a schooner to offer terms. By 5&nbsp;pm. Maurice had agreed to surrender Diamond Rock, the officers were to retain their swords and the men would remain under their orders.<ref name=\"Henderson303\"/> They were to be taken to Fort-de-France, and from there repatriated to a British settlement at the first opportunity, under parole. With these terms agreed, the British surrendered Diamond Rock.<ref name=\"Henderson303\"/> The British had two men killed and one man wounded in the battle.<ref name=\"Henderson303\"/> French casualties were harder to judge, Maurice estimated they amounted to seventy, the French commander of the landing force made a 'hasty calculation' of fifty.<ref name=\"Henderson303\"/> In addition to this the British had sunk five large boats, and potentially inflicted further casualties during the bombardment of the French warships.<ref name=\"Henderson303\"/> Maurice and his men were taken off the rock on the morning of 6 June and put on board the ''Pluton'' and ''Berwick''.<ref name=\"Adkins157\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=157}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nMaurice was returned to [[Barbados]] by 6 June, and sent a letter dated that day to Horatio Nelson, who had recently arrived in the Caribbean in search of Villeneuve's fleet.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/>\n{{quote|My Lord<br>IT is with the greatest sorrow I have to inform you of the loss of the Diamond Rock, under my command, which was obliged to surrender on the 2d ist., after three days' attack from a squadron of two sail of the line, one frigate, one brig, a schooner, eleven gun-boats and, from the nearest calculation, 1500 troops. The want of ammunition and water was the sole occasion of its unfortunate loss.... [our losses were] only two killed and one wounded. The enemy, from the nearest account I have been able to obtain, lost on shore 30 killed and 40 wounded: they also lost three gun-boats and two rowing boats.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/>}}\n\nNaval procedure at the time was that all commanders who lost their ships automatically faced a court martial. Accordingly, Maurice was tried by a court martial convened aboard the 28-gun {{HMS|Circe|1804|6}} in [[Carlisle Bay]] on 24 June.<ref name=\"Adkin49\"/> Maurice was honourably acquitted for the loss, the verdict noting {{quote|the Court is of the opinion that Captain J. W. Maurice, the Officers and Company of His Majesty's late sloop Diamond Rock did every thing in their power to the very last, in the defence of the Rock, and against a most superior force ... [Maurice] did not surrender the Diamond until he was unable to make further defence for want of water and ammunition, the Court do therefore honourably acquit Captain Maurice accordingly.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/>}}\n\nVilleneuve had retaken the rock, but the day the attack began the frigate {{HMS|Didon|1805|2}} had arrived with orders from Napoleon.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/> Villeneuve was ordered to take his force and attack British possessions, before returning in force to Europe, hopefully having in the meantime been joined by Ganteaume's fleet. But by now his supplies were so low that he could attempt little more than harassing some of the smaller British islands.<ref name=\"Terraine82\"/> Anti-French feelings grew in the Spanish commander Don Federico Gravina<!-- Please rephrase; meaning is unclear --> after the capture of the Diamond Rock. Gravina wanted to invade the island of [[History of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], under British rule since its capture from the Spanish a couple of years before. Villeneuve left Fort-de-France on 5 June, and on 7 June two French frigates sighted a convoy of 16 British merchants, and Villeneuve signalled general chase. The Spanish 80-gun ship of the line ''Argonauta'' and the two frigates chased down and captured fifteen of the sixteen merchants. The convoy was laden with sugar, rum, coffee, cotton and other products. From them he learnt that Nelson had arrived in the West Indies, in hot pursuit of Villeneuve. Shocked, Villeneuve abandoned his plans to raid the British colonies and immediately began preparations for the return voyage.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/> The fleet got under-way on 11 June, causing one of the army officers attached to the fleet, General [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille]], to note:<blockquote>We have been masters of the sea for three weeks with a landing force of 7000 to 8000 men and have not been able to attack a single island.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/></blockquote> The capture of Diamond Rock and the seizing of 15 merchant ships were the only successes that the combined fleet had during their Caribbean campaign.<ref name=\"Adkin51\"/> The rock remained in French hands until the [[Invasion of Martinique (1809)|capture of Martinique]] in 1809.<ref name=\"Adkins327\">{{cite book |last=Adkins |title=The War for all the Oceans |page=327}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Adkin|first=Mark|title=The Trafalgar Companion: A Guide to History's Most Famous Sea Battle and the Life of Admiral Lord Nelson|location=London|publisher=Aurum Press|year=2007|isbn=1-84513-018-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/trafalgarcompani0000adki}}\n* {{cite book |first=Roy|last=Adkins|author2=Adkins, Lesley|title=The War for all the Oceans: From Nelson at the Nile to Napoleon at Waterloo|year=2007|publisher=Abacus|isbn=978-0-349-11916-8}}\n* {{cite book |first=James|last=Henderson|title=Frigates, Sloops and Brigs|year=2005|publisher=Pen & Sword Military Classics|isbn=1-84415-301-0}}\n* {{cite book |first=Brian|last=Lavery|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men, and Organisation: 1793\u20131815|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|year=1989|isbn=0-85177-521-7}}\n* {{cite book |first=John|last=Terraine|title=Trafalgar|year=1998|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=1-85326-686-8}}\n* {{cite book |first=Nicholas|last=Tracy|title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy: 200 Naval Heroes|year=2006|publisher=Chatham Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-86176-244-5}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01159741219038421890035/028332_0127.pdf Narration of the capture by the Spanish admiral Gravina.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  \nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n  c.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  \nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n  c. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency<ref name=\"frederica\"/>, though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n'''Japanese:'''\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || nikundeiru || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi''''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When Krillin attempts to deliver Goku a Senzu Bean, Frieza attempts to blast him. Vegeta redirects the blast to Sorbet,  which kills him. Afterwards, Vegeta demonstrates his own ability to transform into a Super Saiyan Blue. Frieza attempts to land a hit on Vegeta, but he fails to do so. Frieza is already exhausted from his fight with Goku. Frieza quickly finds himself completely outmatched by Vegeta. Enraged and humiliated, Frieza refuses to accept defeat. While Vegeta powers up a killing shot, Frieza instead fires an attack at the Earth and destroys it out from under them. Whis protects Goku and the others, but Vegeta and everyone else on the planet are killed. Whis suspects Frieza survived and escaped through his ability to breathe in space. As Goku laments his missed opportunity to finish off Frieza and protect the Earth, Whis offers to turn back time by a couple of minutes and allow Goku one last chance. The moment is reset to the end of Vegeta and Frieza's battle. This allows Goku just enough time to charge up a Kamehameha attack and kill Frieza in order to save the Earth. Later, the group gathers at Capsule Corporation, where Piccolo is revived with the Namekian Dragon Balls. Shaken by his helplessness against Frieza, Gohan tells Piccolo that he intends to resume his training so that he can protect his loved ones, which Piccolo is delighted to hear.\n| LineColor           = 2FCE1F\n}}\n|}\n\n===Universe 6 Saga (2016)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1em; background: #C271FF;\"  | Overall No.\n! style=\"width:1em; background: #C271FF;\"  | Saga No.\n! style=\"background: #C271FF;\" | English translation{{efn|name=fn1}} Dub title{{efn|name=fn2}}<br>Original Japanese title\n! style=\"background: #C271FF;\" | Direction\n! style=\"background: #C271FF;\" | Screenplay\n! style=\"width:12em; background: #C271FF;\" | Original airdate<ref name=\"ToeiAnimEpList\"/>\n! style=\"width:12em; background: #C271FF;\" | American airdate<ref name=\"Zap2It\"/>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 1\n| Title               = The God of Destruction from Universe 6 \u2013 His Name Is Champa!\n| TranslitTitle       = Dai-6 uch\u016b no hakaishin \u2013 Sono na wa Shanpa\n| NativeTitle         = \u7b2c6\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u7834\u58ca\u795e \u305d\u306e\u540d\u306f\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| RTitle              = &nbsp;/ \"The 6th Universe's Destroyer!

An argument erupts concerning which universe's food is superior, with Whis explaining to Goku and Vegeta there are eleven universes besides their reality: The Seventh Universe. Whis adds that both the Seventh and Sixth Universes complement each other as their designated numbers add to thirteen. After Vados discovers that Universe Six's Earth has been destroyed through warfare, Champa proposes a tournament with Beerus with the winner allowed to swap Earths. Beerus protests until Champa reveals the feat is possible with the Super Dragon Balls, which the Namekian Dragon Balls were trimmed from, possessing six of them.

Botamo seems content to simply take the punishment. Urged by Vegeta to think before he acts, Goku drags Botamo to the side of the ring and throws him out. This results in a win for Universe Seven.

In direct contrast to Frieza, Frost is a kind and beloved hero in the Sixth Universe who looks forward to a challenge.

But Goku sees through the deception and assumes Super Saiyan form to have Frost accept his request.

After a bout of close combat, Frost defeats Piccolo with a power blast. Before the referee could rule in Frost's favor, Jaco chimes in claiming that Frost had been cheating all along. The referee examines Frost and finds that he had been using an illegal item hidden in his gauntlet to drug his opponents into a temporary stupor.

Beerus then proceeds to have Goku reinstated into the competition after finding where Frost's weapon got him, insisting the Saiyan goes after Monaka with a hushed remark from Whis concerning Monaka's \"true colors\". Vados generates a new barrier around the ring as the referee announces a new rule, where any contact an individual makes with the barrier automatically disqualifies them. Meanwhile, Frost attempts to steal the treasure Champa promised the team and escape in Champa's transportation cube, but is knocked out by the assassin {{nihongo4|Hit|\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|Hitto}} and brought back to the arena.

This provokes Cabba to awaken his Super Saiyan form as he goes on the offensive, only to learn that Vegeta was purposely provoking him into channeling his anger. Vegeta quickly powers up into Super Saiyan Blue to display what Cabba could achieve before knocking him out.

But upon Mr. Satan is injured during the attack, telling Buu to before losing consciousness. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. But as the Zenos are not yet satisfied, and the rules have not been finalized, Basil is allowed to resume the match as Roh gives him an enhancement drug which the Zenos allow despite Beerus's objections. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about his universe's superiority. But Buu emerges unscathed, launching an attack that knocks out Basil and earn a victory for the Seventh Universe before healing Mr. Satan.

Goku lures Jiren onto a large rock that extends out over the edge of the fighting stage and cuts through the rock with a Destructo Disc. This causes Jiren to fall, but Jiren is able to jump off the falling debris and flies back onto the fighting stage. Angered by his near-elimination, Jiren finally unleashes a fraction of his real power and easily overwhelms Goku with a volley of punches.

Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique known as the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode, which increases his power and speed even further, overwhelming Frieza enough that Gohan comes to his aid. Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team, but they have little success. Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand.

Android 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be. Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship. Jiren now focuses solely on increasing his own strength.

Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla. Goku is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha while dodging and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to block the attack and fire his own blast right through to Goku. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win. Vegeta points out that throughout the Tournament of Power all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Belmod is worried. Belmod shouts at Jiren to finish off Goku immediately. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Goku lands a solid blow on Jiren. Goku unleashes all of his power, which manifests as a galaxy-like nebula encompassing the entire area below the tournament stage. Jiren gathers all of his power and launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly transforms again and powers up immensely. Goku easily nullifies Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the tournament stage. Jiren attacks again, but Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches. Whis reveals that Goku has completed his ascension. Goku's hair and eyes have turned silver. Goku has now reached Mastered Ultra Instinct.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 130\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 54\n| Title               = The Greatest Showdown of All Time!

Goku and Jiren exchange attacks continuously. Despite almost being defeated twice, Goku stands up and recovers. Goku regains the edge over Jiren once again. When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, both Goku and his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept this and implications of his impending defeat, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers in a desperate attempt to prove that friendship is meaningless. However, the attack is repelled by a furious Goku, who powers up even further and finally defeats Jiren. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Mastered Ultra Instinct for too long. Despite this opportunity, Jiren hesitates in knocking Goku off the tournament stage. Jiren leaves everyone from Universe Eleven in shock until Belmod reminds Jiren about the Super Dragon Balls and his ultimate wish. Though upset, Jiren decides to take the opportunity to eliminate Goku. Jiren admits to Goku that this was not how he wanted to win, but Goku will always live on in his memories even after he ceases to exist. Jiren blasts Goku off the tournament stage, but he is saved by Frieza. Android 17 is also revealed to have survived his apparent self-destruction. As Frieza and Android 17 prepare themselves to face Jiren, Goku writhes in pain from the aftereffects of Ultra Instinct.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 131\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 55\n| Title               = A Miraculous Conclusion!

While Frieza takes the lead in the attack, Android 17 manages to injure Jiren with another surprise attack, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Top calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up into his limit-breaking state again and fires a massive blast at Frieza and Android 17. They form an energy barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and drops out of his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier, which enables them to cancel out Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while Android 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him off the tournament stage, which eliminates Goku, Frieza, and Jiren from the Tournament of Power. With all of their fighters defeated, Universe Eleven is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the tournament stage, Android 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power. Android 17 is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, Android 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Present Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d had foreseen the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. The Grand Minister also stated that if the winner had made a selfish wish instead then the Present Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d would have erased the entire multiverse because this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the Tournament of Power were no more worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the Tournament of Power, Beerus asks Whis to restore Frieza to life. In Universe Eleven, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Top and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. Beerus, Whis, Shin, the Elder Universe Seven Supreme Kai, Goku, and his nine team members from Universe Seven return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku and Vegeta enter their Super Saiyan Blue forms. Goku reveals that he cannot achieve Ultra Instinct at will. Goku believes that he obtained it by accident during the Tournament of Power. Goku and Vegeta declare that they will keep finding new levels of strength. Goku and Vegeta race towards each other to fight.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Dragon Ball films]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\"/>\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Dragon Ball anime}}\n{{Portal bar|Anime and manga}}\n\n[[Category:Dragon Ball episode lists|Super]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Dragon Ball Super'' episodes}}\n[[File:Dragon Ball Super artwork.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Promotional artwork]]\n\n''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' is a Japanese [[anime]] television series produced by [[Toei Animation]] that began airing on July 5, 2015 on [[Fuji TV]].<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-06-04/dragon-ball-super-tv-anime-debuts-on-july-5/.88900 |title=Dragon Ball Super TV Anime Debuts on July 5 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126121146/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-06-04/dragon-ball-super-tv-anime-debuts-on-july-5/.88900 |archivedate=January 26, 2016 |df= }}</ref> It is the first television series in the ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'' franchise to feature a new story in 18 years.

An impatient Beerus was about to destroy the planet when Videl offers to join the ritual while revealing to be pregnant with Gohan's unborn child.

Frieza himself fails to notice this. Vegeta urges Goku to quickly finish Frieza off before he has a chance to recover, or he will step up and do so himself. After Goku and Frieza exchange some sarcastic banter, they power up again and continue their fight. Frieza still has the upper hand, but Goku realizes he only needs to stall Frieza long enough for his weakness to reappear. After a fully powered Frieza unleashes a barrage of attacks, he quickly becomes tired and starts running out of breath Frieza's attacks no longer hurt Goku. Frieza finally realizes his weakness, which is a lack of endurance. His Golden form exhausts more energy than he can produce. Goku explains this is because Frieza rushed to Earth immediately after achieving the Golden form without giving himself enough time to master it. Frieza agonizes over his failed chance at revenge in combat, but mouths a few inaudible words to Sorbet for assistance. Goku tells Frieza to leave Earth, while he still can do so. Everyone is surprised to see a laser beam pierce Goku's chest from behind, which was fired from Sorbet's ray gun. Stomping on Goku's chest wound to make him scream, Frieza gloats about his backup strategy to have Goku let his guard down.

While Vegeta powers up a killing shot, Frieza instead fires an attack at the Earth and destroys it out from under them. Whis protects Goku and the others, but Vegeta and everyone else on the planet are killed. Whis suspects Frieza survived and escaped through his ability to breathe in space. As Goku laments his missed opportunity to finish off Frieza and protect the Earth, Whis offers to turn back time by a couple of minutes and allow Goku one last chance. The moment is reset to the end of Vegeta and Frieza's battle. This allows Goku just enough time to charge up a Kamehameha attack and kill Frieza in order to save the Earth.

Goku takes a while to warm up due to having overeaten during the trip. Although Goku seems faster and more well trained than Botamo, none of the hits that he lands seem to have an effect. Botamo seems content to simply take the punishment. Urged by Vegeta to think before he acts, Goku drags Botamo to the side of the ring and throws him out. This results in a win for Universe Seven. The next match begins almost immediately with Goku facing the Frieza-like combatant {{nihongo4|Frost|\u30d5\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8|Furosuto}}. In direct contrast to Frieza, Frost is a kind and beloved hero in the Sixth Universe who looks forward to a challenge. Goku surprises Frost with knowledge of his transformations while asking him to assume his final form, Frost attempting to hold back by assuming his third form. But Goku sees through the deception and assumes Super Saiyan form to have Frost accept his request. Frost seems greatly outmatched by Goku even in his final transformation until a strange effect comes over the Saiyan, allowing Frost the chance to knock Goku out of the ring to his friends' shock.\n| LineColor           = C271FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 7\n| Title               = Piccolo vs. Frost \u2013 Put It All on the Special Beam Cannon!\n| TranslitTitle       = Pikkoro VS Furosuto \u2013 Makank\u014dsapp\u014d ni subete o kakero!\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d4\u30c3\u30b3\u30edVS\u30d5\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8 \u9b54\u8cab\u5149\u6bba\u7832\u306b\u3059\u3079\u3066\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308d!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| RTitle              = &nbsp;/ \"Piccolo vs Frost!

After a bout of close combat, Frost defeats Piccolo with a power blast. Before the referee could rule in Frost's favor, Jaco chimes in claiming that Frost had been cheating all along. The referee examines Frost and finds that he had been using an illegal item hidden in his gauntlet to drug his opponents into a temporary stupor. Champa is initially outraged to find that Frost had cheated. Vados reveals that Frost actually runs a criminal empire with the latter confessing that he set up the attacks on the planets he saved.

Beerus then proceeds to have Goku reinstated into the competition after finding where Frost's weapon got him, insisting the Saiyan goes after Monaka with a hushed remark from Whis concerning Monaka's \"true colors\". Vados generates a new barrier around the ring as the referee announces a new rule, where any contact an individual makes with the barrier automatically disqualifies them. Meanwhile, Frost attempts to steal the treasure Champa promised the team and escape in Champa's transportation cube, but is knocked out by the assassin {{nihongo4|Hit|\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|Hitto}} and brought back to the arena.

This seemingly enrages Vegeta as he assumes his Super Saiyan to mercilessly beat Cabba to an inch of his life while threatening to kill everyone he holds dear if he loses. This provokes Cabba to awaken his Super Saiyan form as he goes on the offensive, only to learn that Vegeta was purposely provoking him into channeling his anger. Vegeta quickly powers up into Super Saiyan Blue to display what Cabba could achieve before knocking him out. Though Cabba thanks Vegeta for telling him about his untapped potential, he brushes him off and tells the youth to forget his Saiyan pride and surpass all others.

Initially, Hit overpowers Goku, which prompts him to ask Goku to surrender.

Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, the Second Universe's {{nihongo4|Prum|\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|Puran}}, can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate {{nihongo4|Harmira|\u30cf\u30fc\u30df\u30e9|H\u0101mira}}. Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Harmira, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Harmira. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Harmira shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Harmira down with them. Tien and Harmira are eliminated from the Tournament of Power. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him.

When Dyspo refuses the offer, Frieza powers up to his Golden form and gains the advantage in the fight. Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique known as the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode, which increases his power and speed even further, overwhelming Frieza enough that Gohan comes to his aid. Gohan and Frieza take on Dyspo as a team, but they have little success. Gohan develops a strategy that has Frieza use his energy to form a cage around Dyspo, which prevents him from using his high-speed attacks and allows Gohan to gain the upper hand. Unfortunately, Frieza runs out of energy. The cage dissolves before Gohan can land the finishing blow. But Gohan is able to grab Dyspo and holds long enough for Frieza to blast them off the ring, with one fighter from the remaining teams eliminated.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 125\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 49\n| Title               = With Imposing Presence!

Top unleashes his new power, which damages the fighting stage and breaks a large portion of it.

Android 17 is able to evade him for a while by using the broken fighting stage to his advantage, but Top effortlessly withstands Android 17's attacks. Top prepares to eliminate Android 17 with a giant energy blast, but Frieza rejoins the battle and deflects Top's attack. Frieza uses his own energy attack to immobilize Top, which allows him and Android 17 to land numerous attacks, but none of them have any effect. Top is about to eliminate them both, when he is interrupted by Goku and Vegeta, who are still fighting Jiren. Frieza and Android 17 are hit by one of Jiren's attacks, which gives Top the opportunity to attack Vegeta instead. Top overwhelms Vegeta with his new power and states that he has cast aside everything else in order to become strong enough to win the Tournament of Power. However, Vegeta is inspired by his family, his promise to Cabba, and his Saiyan pride. Vegeta refuses to cast anything aside. Vegeta unleashes his full power and overwhelms Top. Vegeta and Top both use their ultimate attacks. Top unleashes his Energy of Destruction, while Vegeta uses the Final Explosion technique that he used against Majin Buu. Vegeta's attack overwhelms Top's attack. Vegeta blasts Top out of the fighting stage and eliminates him from the Tournament of Power. This also causes even more damage to the fighting stage. Due to Vegeta being much stronger than he was the last time he used the Final Explosion technique, he survives the blast. Vegeta's energy is almost completely drained. Android 17 also reappears, but he has been injured by Jiren's attack. Goku, Vegeta, and Android 17 all face off against Jiren, who begins to unleash his full power.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 127\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 51\n| Title               = The Approaching Wall!

Jiren defeats Goku and Vegeta, while Frieza rejoins the fight and tries to kill Jiren in his golden form. However, Frieza is easily defeated as well and knocked out once again. Android 17 asks Jiren what his wish on the Super Dragon Balls would be. Belmod explains that Jiren's endless pursuit of strength was inspired when his parents, most of his comrades, and mentor were killed by a powerful villain. However, his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship. Jiren now focuses solely on increasing his own strength. This allows Android 17 to figure out Jiren's wish, which is to resurrect his former master. Android 17 admires Jiren's human qualities, but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe's team for his own ends. Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at Android 17, Goku, and Vegeta. Android 17 uses an energy barrier to hold back Jiren's blast and forms force fields around Goku and Vegeta to protect them.  Android 17 unleashes all of his energy to destroy Jiren's blast, while he seemingly self-destructs. Injured and exhausted, Goku is unable to stand up. Despite his exhausted state, Vegeta manages to get up to face off against Jiren.

Although Vegeta is too exhausted to turn into even a Super Saiyan, he still decides to take on Jiren. Jiren easily dodges his attacks and continues to pummel Vegeta. Jiren injures Vegeta's left eye in the process. Vegeta is knocked to the brink of elimination. Vegeta begins to think about the people in his life he cares about the most. Vegeta gets back up and continues to fight Jiren, who is impressed by Vegeta's pride. Vegeta nearly falls off the tournament stage again. Vegeta's boot catches onto a floating piece of rubble, which narrowly allows him to stay in the fight because the pieces of rubble still count as part of the tournament stage. Vegeta hears Bulma's voice urging him to fight on. Vegeta returns to fight Jiren once again. Jiren is unable to understand why Vegeta continues to fight him. Vegeta fires off a Final Flash, but Jiren is unfazed. Jiren knocks Vegeta off the tournament stage and eliminates him from the Tournament of Power. Although Vegeta is upset at being unable to last until the end, he gives Goku his remaining energy at the last second before falling off the tournament stage. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and begins to fight Jiren with his remaining power. Even with Vegeta's energy, Goku is still overwhelmed by Jiren. Goku is knocked back into his base form. When Goku is pushed back to the edge of the tournament stage and only one punch away from defeat, Vegeta shouts at Goku. Goku thinks about how the others have all put their faith in him. As Jiren delivers the final blow, Goku suddenly reactivates Ultra Instinct and dodges the attack. With his new power, Goku is able to effortlessly dodge Jiren's attacks and lands a heavy blow on him. Both fighters face off and prepare for their final battle.\n| LineColor           = B20033\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 129\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 53\n| Title               = Limits Super Surpassed!

Goku and Jiren resume their battle, but Goku has the same problem he experienced with Kefla. Goku is unable to attack at his full potential. Goku tries the same trick he used on Kefla by powering up a Kamehameha while dodging and firing it at Jiren, but Jiren is able to block the attack and fire his own blast right through to Goku. Belmod is confident that Goku's incomplete Ultra Instinct will not be enough to win. Vegeta points out that throughout the Tournament of Power all of the Saiyans have been able to surpass their limits and achieve higher levels of power. Belmod is worried. Belmod shouts at Jiren to finish off Goku immediately. Jiren is able to trap Goku on a single floating rock and fires a barrage of attacks down at him in an attempt to knock him out, but Goku begins blocking Jiren's attacks with his own punches. Goku lands a solid blow on Jiren. Goku unleashes all of his power, which manifests as a galaxy-like nebula encompassing the entire area below the tournament stage. Jiren gathers all of his power and launches a final blast down at Goku, but Goku suddenly transforms again and powers up immensely. Goku easily nullifies Jiren's blast and jumps back up to the tournament stage. Jiren attacks again, but Goku easily overpowers him with a flurry of punches.

When Jiren asks why Goku refuses to surrender, both Goku and his friends claim that the source of Goku's strength comes from the trust between him and his companions. Refusing to accept this and implications of his impending defeat, an enraged Jiren launches an attack on the bleachers in a desperate attempt to prove that friendship is meaningless. However, the attack is repelled by a furious Goku, who powers up even further and finally defeats Jiren. However, just as Goku is about to knock Jiren out, his body collapses from the strain of using Mastered Ultra Instinct for too long. Despite this opportunity, Jiren hesitates in knocking Goku off the tournament stage. Jiren leaves everyone from Universe Eleven in shock until Belmod reminds Jiren about the Super Dragon Balls and his ultimate wish. Though upset, Jiren decides to take the opportunity to eliminate Goku. Jiren admits to Goku that this was not how he wanted to win, but Goku will always live on in his memories even after he ceases to exist. Jiren blasts Goku off the tournament stage, but he is saved by Frieza. Android 17 is also revealed to have survived his apparent self-destruction.

While Frieza takes the lead in the attack, Android 17 manages to injure Jiren with another surprise attack, who collapses from exhaustion. Frieza is about to eliminate Jiren, who accepts his impending defeat, but Top calls out to Jiren and inspires him to keep fighting despite his injuries. Jiren powers up into his limit-breaking state again and fires a massive blast at Frieza and Android 17. They form an energy barrier to shield themselves, but Frieza is running low on energy and drops out of his Golden form. Before Jiren can overpower them, Goku manages to get back up and rejoins the others. Goku adds his strength to the barrier, which enables them to cancel out Jiren's blast. Goku and Frieza take on Jiren together, while Android 17 provides cover fire. Working together, Goku and Frieza overpower Jiren and tackle him off the tournament stage, which eliminates Goku, Frieza, and Jiren from the Tournament of Power. With all of their fighters defeated, Universe Eleven is erased. As the only fighter remaining on the tournament stage, Android 17 is declared the winner of the Tournament of Power. Android 17 is given the privilege of getting his wish granted from the Super Dragon Balls. After some consideration, Android 17 wishes to restore all of the universes that had been erased, which brings all their inhabitants back to life. As the erased universes are restored, the Grand Minister reveals that Present Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d had foreseen the outcome of a virtuous being winning the Tournament of Power who would make a selfless wish on the Super Dragon Balls. The Grand Minister also stated that if the winner had made a selfish wish instead then the Present Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d would have erased the entire multiverse because this would have shown that the winning universe was no better than the erased universes and that the universes excluded from the Tournament of Power were no more worthy of existing. As a reward for doing well in the Tournament of Power, Beerus asks Whis to restore Frieza to life. In Universe Eleven, Jiren establishes a real friendship with Top and looks forward to having a rematch with Goku someday. Beerus, Whis, Shin, the Elder Universe Seven Supreme Kai, Goku, and his nine team members from Universe Seven return home. Frieza leaves Earth and resumes leadership of his empire. Goku vows to defeat him if he starts causing trouble again. Goku and Vegeta meet for a sparring match in the place where they first fought. Goku and Vegeta enter their Super Saiyan Blue forms.
