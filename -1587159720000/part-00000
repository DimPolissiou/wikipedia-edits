By the end of [[World War I]] the workforce had increased from 200 to 1000 as they started building propulsion units for warships, and drive mechanisms for armaments. By 1921 the company was the largest worm gear manufacturer in the world.<ref name=\"davidbrown.com history\">http://www.davidbrown.com/history.php</ref>\n\nIn 1930 the company took over P.R. Jackson Ltd, another local firm of gear manufacturers and steel founders. Percy's eldest son (Sir David Brown) became managing director in 1931 following Percy's death in June that year. W S Roe was appointed joint managing director with David but he died in April 1933. Percy was appointed chairman. The firm formed another overseas joint venture with Richardson Gears (Pty) Ltd of Footscray, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia in 1934. In 1934 the company moved into an old Silk Mill on a site at [[Meltham]], on the south side of Huddersfield. Brown started building tractors with [[Harry Ferguson]] there in 1936. \n\nThe company obtained a patent for a tank transmission using controlled differential steering system, known as the '''Merritt-Brown''' system, devised by Dr. [[H. E. Merritt]], Director of Tank Design at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]], in 1935.<ref name=\"davidbrown.com history\" /> The first vehicle to use this system was the [[Churchill tank]], and it was subsequently used on the [[Centurion tank]] and the [[Conqueror tank]], as well as the [[Tortoise heavy assault tank|Tortoise heavy tank]].\n\n===David Brown Tractors Group===\n[[File:David Brown Tractors, Meltham Mills (RLH).jpg|thumb|right|David Brown Tractor Factory Meltham Mills 1981]]\nPersonally controlled since its inception by David Brown  (1904\u20131993) the first venture into tractor production was in a joint project with [[Harry Ferguson]] in 1936 building the '''Ferguson-Brown''' tractor. David Brown became one of the biggest British tractor manufactures in the post war period, with a major manufacturing plant at Meltham, [[West Yorkshire]] England. The company broke new ground which others were only to follow later, but being a pioneering company ultimately led to its downfall. The Ferguson-Brown had many innovative features, including the use of cast alloy for many the components, which was light but prone to damage. The Ferguson-Brown used a [[Coventry Climax]] engine for the first 350 tractors. Browns developed their own engine which was fitted to subsequent production. Total production was 1350 + 1 built from parts in 1940 after production finished.<ref>David Brown Tractors 1936 to 1964, Alan Earnshaw, Nostalgia Road, {{ISBN|1-903016-02-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:1971 David Brown 990.jpg|thumb|right|1971 David Brown 990 tractor]]\nBrown and Ferguson disagreed over tractor design details in the late 30s, which led David Brown to design his own version, the ''VAK1'', in secret. This was launched at the 1939 Royal Show.<ref>David Brown Tractors 1965\u20131988, by Anthony L Heath, {{ISBN|1-903016-03-7}}</ref> Ferguson split away from Brown and joined up with [[Henry Ford]] in 1938, after a 'handshake' agreement, to allow his 'Ferguson System' [[Three-point hitch|three-point linkage]] to be used on the [[Ford N Series Tractors|Fordson N]] tractors. That agreement was eventually terminated by Ford's grandson in 1947 and Ferguson again split away to form [[Ferguson Tractor]]s in 1948.<ref>[http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/machines_0204.html livinghistoryfarm.org \u2013 Ford-Ferguson Tractors]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, with over 7,700 units eventually sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker. Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the [[Royal Air Force]] and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. [[W.H. Dorman & Co|Dorman]] Diesel and a five-speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.\n<gallery>Image:1952-1953 David Brown Trackmaster 30T Cut-away.JPG|Side view of a cut away display of a 1953 30T Trackmaster\nImage:1952-1953 David Brown Trackmaster 30T.JPG|Rear view of a cut away display of a 1953 30T Trackmaster\n</gallery>\n\nThe tractors division took over the Lancashire firm of Harrison, McGregor & Guest Ltd, who produced the Albion brand of agricultural machinery to complement the tractor product line. After the takeover the company's badge was modified to incorporate the white rose of Yorkshire and the red rose of Lancashire. The Tractors division had ten subsidiaries around the world. At one stage 80% of production was exported. Sales were handled by 2,508 agents in 100 countries.<ref>David Brown Tractors 1936\u20131964, by Alan Earnshaw, p5, {{ISBN|1-903016-02-9}}</ref> A worldwide recession saw tractor sales slump, and after braving the storm and with the debt of a brand new building and production line to finance, it was inevitable that the company was put up for sale, bought by Tenneco who also owned ji case company, all hope to see the factory prosper was dashed when it was announced that survival was a competition between Huddersfield and the international Tractor plant in Doncaster, with the odds stacked in the latter's favour, especially with access to the motorway network on the doorstep. The Meltham factory ended production and a respected British name was erased.\n\n====Tractor Group's Lagonda and Aston Martin====\nIn 1947, Brown saw a [[classified advertisement]] in ''[[The Times]]'', offering for sale a ''High Class Motor Business''. Brown acquired [[Aston Martin]] for \u00a320,500 and, in the following year, [[Lagonda]] for \u00a352,500, followed by the coachbuilder [[Tickford]] in 1955. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin manufacturing at the Tickford premises in [[Newport Pagnell]]. The [[Aston_Martin#The_David_Brown_era|David Brown years]] saw production of the legendary DB series of Aston Martins, which were featured in some [[James Bond]] films.  \n\nDavid Brown also had connections with [[Vosper & Company|Vosper]] shipbuilding, and [[Delapina]] and [[Radyne]] machinery.\n\nBoth car companies were sold in 1972 to [[Company Developments Limited]], when Aston Martin was in financial trouble, for a nominal \u00a3100.\n\n===Sale of David Brown Tractors to Case 1972===\nIn 1972 the tractor operations were sold to [[Tenneco|Tenneco Inc.]] of America, who owned the [[Case Corporation|J.I. Case]] tractor company. The sale was due to a combination of a reduction in the UK tractor market, increased product development costs, the need to meet new regulations on health and safety, and increased competition from imported machinery.  Case applied the David Brown name and branding to some of its own tractor models in the UK market until the early 1980s before abandoning it in favour of the Case IH brand.\n\n===Sale by David Brown family \u2013 management buyout 1990===\nIn 1990 the David Brown family disposed of its stake to the business's management. It then floated David Brown as a public company in 1993. David Brown was acquired by [[Textron|Textron Inc.]] in October 1998.  \n\nThis business, trading as David Brown Engineering Ltd and headquartered in Huddersfield, remains a supplier of heavy transmission systems for industrial, defense, railway and marine applications. These include transmissions for the British [[Challenger 2 tank]]s and American [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s.<ref>[http://www.davidbrown.com/history.php David Brown Website \u2013 History]</ref> Railway transmissions are produced for their Chinese branch 'David Brown China', in a joint partnership called 'Jiangsu Shinri David Brown Gear Systems' at a factory in [[Changzhou]] near Shanghai.<ref>[http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2010/04/30/david-brown-gear-systems-on-track-in-china-86081-26346335/ David Brown Gear Systems on track in China (30 April 2010)]</ref>\n\n===Sale by Textron 2008===\nIn September 2008 it was announced that David Brown Gear systems and associated companies, David Brown Hydraulics based in Poole in Dorset, Maag Pumps of Switzerland, and Union Pumps of the USA were to be sold to [[Clyde Blowers]] of Scotland&nbsp;\u2014 owned by entrepreneur [[Jim McColl]]&nbsp;\u2014 in a \u00a3368&nbsp;million deal.<ref>Classic Tractors, issue no. 92, December 2008</ref>\n\nin 2016 David Brown was merged with Santasalo to form '''David Brown Santasalo'''.

This was launched at the 1939 Royal Show.<ref>David Brown Tractors 1965\u20131988, by Anthony L Heath, {{ISBN|1-903016-03-7}}</ref> Ferguson split away from Brown and joined up with [[Henry Ford]] in 1938, after a 'handshake' agreement, to allow his 'Ferguson System' [[Three-point hitch|three-point linkage]] to be used on the [[Ford N Series Tractors|Fordson N]] tractors. That agreement was eventually terminated by Ford's grandson in 1947 and Ferguson again split away to form [[Ferguson Tractor]]s in 1948.<ref>[http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/machines_0204.html livinghistoryfarm.org \u2013 Ford-Ferguson Tractors]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] Brown's new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, with over 7,700 units eventually sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker. Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the [[Royal Air Force]] and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. [[W.H. Dorman & Co|Dorman]] Diesel and a five-speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.\n<gallery>Image:1952-1953 David Brown Trackmaster 30T Cut-away.JPG|Side view of a cut away display of a 1953 30T Trackmaster\nImage:1952-1953 David Brown Trackmaster 30T.JPG|Rear view of a cut away display of a 1953 30T Trackmaster\n</gallery>\n\nThe tractors division took over the Lancashire firm of Harrison, McGregor & Guest Ltd, who produced the Albion brand of agricultural machinery to complement the tractor product line. After the takeover the company's badge was modified to incorporate the white rose of Yorkshire and the red rose of Lancashire. The Tractors division had ten subsidiaries around the world. At one stage 80% of production was exported. Sales were handled by 2,508 agents in 100 countries.<ref>David Brown Tractors 1936\u20131964, by Alan Earnshaw, p5, {{ISBN|1-903016-02-9}}</ref> A worldwide recession saw tractor sales slump, and after braving the storm and with the debt of a brand new building and production line to finance, it was inevitable that the company was put up for sale, bought by Tenneco who also owned ji case company, all hope to see the factory prosper was dashed when it was announced that survival was a competition between Huddersfield and the international Tractor plant in Doncaster, with the odds stacked in the latter's favour, especially with access to the motorway network on the doorstep. The Meltham factory ended production and a respected British name was erased.\n\n====Tractor Group's Lagonda and Aston Martin====\nIn 1947, Brown saw a [[classified advertisement]] in ''[[The Times]]'', offering for sale a ''High Class Motor Business''. Brown acquired [[Aston Martin]] for \u00a320,500 and, in the following year, [[Lagonda]] for \u00a352,500, followed by the coachbuilder [[Tickford]] in 1955. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin manufacturing at the Tickford premises in [[Newport Pagnell]]. The [[Aston_Martin#The_David_Brown_era|David Brown years]] saw production of the legendary DB series of Aston Martins, which were featured in some [[James Bond]] films.  \n\nDavid Brown also had connections with [[Vosper & Company|Vosper]] shipbuilding, and [[Delapina]] and [[Radyne]] machinery.\n\nBoth car companies were sold in 1972 to [[Company Developments Limited]], when Aston Martin was in financial trouble, for a nominal \u00a3100.\n\n===Sale of David Brown Tractors to Case 1972===\nIn 1972 the tractor operations were sold to [[Tenneco|Tenneco Inc.]] of America, who owned the [[Case Corporation|J.I. Case]] tractor company. The sale was due to a combination of a reduction in the UK tractor market, increased product development costs, the need to meet new regulations on health and safety, and increased competition from imported machinery.  Case applied the David Brown name and branding to some of its own tractor models in the UK market until the early 1980s before abandoning it in favour of the Case IH brand.\n\n===Sale by David Brown family \u2013 management buyout 1990===\nIn 1990 the David Brown family disposed of its stake to the business's management. It then floated David Brown as a public company in 1993. David Brown was acquired by [[Textron|Textron Inc.]] in October 1998.  \n\nThis business, trading as David Brown Engineering Ltd and headquartered in Huddersfield, remains a supplier of heavy transmission systems for industrial, defense, railway and marine applications. These include transmissions for the British [[Challenger 2 tank]]s and American [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s.<ref>[http://www.davidbrown.com/history.php David Brown Website \u2013 History]</ref> Railway transmissions are produced for their Chinese branch 'David Brown China', in a joint partnership called 'Jiangsu Shinri David Brown Gear Systems' at a factory in [[Changzhou]] near Shanghai.<ref>[http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2010/04/30/david-brown-gear-systems-on-track-in-china-86081-26346335/ David Brown Gear Systems on track in China (30 April 2010)]</ref>\n\n===Sale by Textron 2008===\nIn September 2008 it was announced that David Brown Gear systems and associated companies, David Brown Hydraulics based in Poole in Dorset, Maag Pumps of Switzerland, and Union Pumps of the USA were to be sold to [[Clyde Blowers]] of Scotland&nbsp;\u2014 owned by entrepreneur [[Jim McColl]]&nbsp;\u2014 in a \u00a3368&nbsp;million deal.<ref>Classic Tractors, issue no. 92, December 2008</ref>\n\nin 2016 David Brown was merged with Santasalo to form '''David Brown Santasalo'''.

At the same time, the DH.84 Dragon was used to inaugurate an Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Liverpool route.\n\nThe airline was established as the national carrier under the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]] (1936).<ref name=\"EI\" /> In 1937, the Irish government created Aer Rianta (now called [[Dublin Airport Authority]]), a company to assume financial responsibility for the new airline and the entire country's civil aviation infrastructure. In April 1937, Aer Lingus became wholly owned by the Irish government via Aer Rianta.\n\nThe airline's first General Manager was Dr J.F. (Jeremiah known as 'Jerry') Dempsey, a chartered accountant, who joined the company on secondment from Kennedy Crowley & Co (predecessor to [[KPMG]]) as Company Secretary in 1936 (aged 30) and was appointed to the role of General Manager in 1937. He retired 30 years later in 1967 at the age of 60.\n\nIn 1938, a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide]] replaced ''Iolar'', and the company purchased a second DH.86B. Two [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14s]] arrived in 1939, Aer Lingus' first all-metal aircraft.\n[[File:Aer Lingus DC-3 Manchester 1949.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1948 wearing the first postwar livery.]]\n\nIn January 1940, a new airport opened in the Dublin suburb of Collinstown and Aer Lingus moved its operations there. It purchased a new [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] and inaugurated new services to [[Liverpool]] and an internal service to [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]. The airline's services were curtailed during World War II with the sole route being to Liverpool or [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]] Manchester depending on the fluctuating security situation.\n\n=== Post-war expansion ===\nOn 9 November 1945, regular services were resumed with an inaugural flight to London. From this point Aer Lingus aircraft, initially mostly [[Douglas DC-3]]s, were painted in a silver and green livery. The airline introduced its first flight attendants.\n\nIn 1946, a new Anglo-Irish agreement gave Aer Lingus exclusive UK traffic rights from Ireland in exchange for a 40% holding by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus' growth the airline bought seven new [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]] aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.\n[[File:Bristol 170.31 EI-AFS Aer Lingus Ringway 08.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] at Manchester Airport in 1953.]]\n\nIn 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann came into existence to operate [[transatlantic flight]]s to [[New York City]] from Ireland. The airline ordered five new [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation]]s, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. [[John A Costello]], the incoming [[Fine Gael]] [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.<ref name=Garvin>{{cite book| title=Preventing the Future, Why Ireland Remained so Poor for so long| first=Tom| last=Garvin| date=13 September 2005| publisher=Gill & MacMillan, Ltd.| isbn=978-0-7171-3970-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Aer Lingus Viscount 808 Manchester 1963.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Viscount]] 808 in \"green top\" livery at Manchester Airport in 1963.]]\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]] via [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure, the airline became one of the early purchasers of [[Vickers Viscount]] 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its all-freight services and acquired a small fleet of [[Bristol 170 Freighter]]s, which remained in service until 1957.\n\nProf. [[Patrick Lynch (economist)|Patrick Lynch]] was appointed the chairman of Aer Lingus and [[Aer Rianta]] in 1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/top-irish-economist-patrick-lynch-dies-26251868.html|title=Top Irish economist Patrick Lynch dies|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-force-behind-country-s-economic-growth-in-the-60s-1.337754|title=A force behind country's economic growth in the 60s|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> and served in the position until 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/entertainment/niall-pioneers-definitive-book-on-national-airline-27774134.html|title=Niall pioneers definitive book on national airline|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lightning flash down the windows and the Irish flag displayed on the fin.\n\n=== First transatlantic service ===\n[[File:Boeing 720-048 EI-ALA Aer Lingus 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 720]] in Aer Lingus-Irish International livery in 1965.]]\n\nOn 28 April 1958, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann operated its first transatlantic service from [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] to New York. Three [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]]s were used for the twice-weekly service aboard aircraft leased from the US airline [[Seaboard World Airlines|Seaboard and Western]] with Irish cabin crews. This arrangement continued until 1 January 1960 when Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann was renamed Aer Lingus \u2013 Irish International Airlines.\n\nAer Lingus bought seven [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]s, which were delivered between November 1958 and May 1959. These were used in short-haul services to the UK, gradually replacing the Dakotas, until Aer Lingus disposed of them during 1966 in favour of secondhand Viscount 800s.\n\nThe airline entered the jet age on 14 December 1960 when it received three [[Boeing 720]] for use on the New York route and the newest Aer Lingus destination [[Boston]].\n\nIn 1963, Aer Lingus added [[Aviation Traders Carvair]]s to the fleet. These aircraft could transport five cars which were loaded into the fuselage through the nose of the aircraft. The Carvair proved to be uneconomical for the airline partly due to the rise of [[Roll-on/roll-off|auto ferry services]], and the aircraft were used for freight services until disposed of.\n\nThe Boeing 720s proved to be a success for the airline on the transatlantic routes. To supplement these, Aer Lingus took delivery of its first larger Boeing 707 in 1964, and the type continued to serve the airline until 1986.\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus Fokker Friendship Manchester 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Fokker F27]] Friendship at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1965. The F27 was used on short-haul services between 1958 and 1966.]]\n\nConversion of the European fleet to jet equipment began in 1965 when the [[BAC One-Eleven]] started services from Dublin and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to Paris and via [[Manchester]] to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, D\u00fcsseldorf and Frankfurt. The airline adopted a new livery in the same year, with a large green [[shamrock (Irish symbol)|shamrock]] on the fin and titles of ''Aer Lingus-Irish International'' just above the windows. In 1966, the remainder of the company's shares held by [[Dublin Airport Authority|Aer Rianta]] were transferred to the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n[[File:Carvair and ambassador at bristol airport 1965 arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Aviation Traders Carvair]] that was used as a vehicle freighter is seen loading a car at [[Bristol Airport]] in 1964.]]\n\nIn 1966, the company inaugurated a route from Shannon to [[Montr\u00e9al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]] and onward to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]]. In 1968, flights from [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]], to New York City started, however, it was soon suspended due to the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. Aer Lingus introduced [[Boeing 737]]s to its fleet in 1969 to cope with the high demand for flights between Dublin and London. Later, Aer Lingus extended the 737 flights to all of its European networks.\n\nIn 1967, after 30 years of service, General Manager Dr J.F. Dempsey signed the contract for the airline's first two [[Boeing 747]] aircraft before he retired later that year.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus BAC 1-11 at Zurich - July 1975.jpg|thumb|A BAC One-Eleven in the old livery at [[Zurich Airport]], Switzerland in 1975.]]\nOn 6 March 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two [[Boeing 747]]s for use on the transatlantic routes.<ref>{{citation| url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1971112500009?opendocument| title=Supplementary Estimates, 1971\u201372 \u2013 Vote 41: Transport and Power| publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas| date=25 November 1971| volume=257| number=3| page=9| quote=The company took delivery of two Boeing 747s (Jumbos) in March 1971, and they went into service in April and May.

In 1974, Aer Lingus unveiled a new livery which eliminated the word ''International'' from the fuselage titles. The livery included two colours of blue and one green, plus the white shamrock on the fin.\n\nIn 1977, Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot, [[Gr\u00e1inne Cronin]] \u2013 the airline was the second in Europe (after [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]) to introduce female pilots.<ref name=Murray>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0526/1224271143395.html |title=Permission to land first woman Aer Lingus pilot retires| work=The Irish Times| date=26 May 2010| last=Murray| first=Ken| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1979, Aer Lingus became the first European airline other than [[Alitalia]] to be used by [[Pope John Paul II]], when he flew aboard a specially modified Boeing 747 (EI-ASI or St. Patrick) from Rome to Dublin and later from Shannon to [[Boston]]. In the early 1980s, the 707s were phased out.\n\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-CFD), Dublin, February 1993.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus Commuter [[Saab 340]] at [[Dublin Airport]] in 1993.]]\n\nIn 1984, the airline formed a fully owned subsidiary, Aer Lingus Commuter, so that Aer Lingus could fly to larger cities in Ireland and Britain whose flying time from Dublin did not require jet aircraft. These services employed five of the Belfast-built [[Short 360]] after conducting a trial with the [[Short 330]]. Around this time Aer Lingus purchased a majority shareholding in the [[cargo airline]] [[Aer Turas]], owner of some [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] freighter jets.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, new [[Boeing 737]]s arrived to replace the older ones, and six [[Fokker 50]]s were added to the ''Commuter'' fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the deregulation act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its operational policies. It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four [[Saab 340]]Bs arrived at the commuter division to replace the [[Short 360]] aircraft. By 1992, Aer Lingus's entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world operating all three versions of the second-generation 737. These were the \u2212300, \u2212400 and \u2212500 series, although the \u2212300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.\n\n==== Airbus operations ====\n[[File:aerlingus.a321-200.ei-cpe.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A321]] landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 2007.]]\n\nIn 1994, Aer Lingus started direct services between Dublin and the United States using the [[Airbus A330]] and in May of that year, Aer Lingus operated the first A330-300 [[ETOPS]] service over the North Atlantic. This led to the phasing out of the [[Boeing 747]] and the briefly operated [[Boeing 767]]-300ER. On 2 October 1995, the Boeing 747 service ceased operations after twenty-five years of service. By that time, over eight million people had travelled across the Atlantic in Aer Lingus Boeing 747s. The late 1990s saw Aer Lingus return to [[Belfast]] with service to New York via Shannon.  It also added [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] as a destination, but discontinued these flights in 2001.\n\nThe first [[Airbus]] short-haul aircraft arrived in 1998 in the form of the [[Airbus A321|A321]], initially to mainly operate the Dublin-Heathrow route. Six were delivered in 1998 and 1999 and three of these continue in service today. The first [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] was delivered in 2000, with three more added to the fleet by 2001.\n\nOn 1 February 2001, Aer Lingus Commuter merged back into the mainline operation. The business was severely affected by the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].  In response, the airline cut staff numbers and destinations and reduced its fleet.  As a result, it weathered the storm and returned to profit, largely through lowering the airline's cost base, updating the fleet with modern Airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland European destinations. Aer Lingus had previously largely neglected mainland Europe in favour of US and British destinations.  It positioned itself as competition to the European [[no frills|no-frills]] airlines while offering intercontinental flights, phased-out Business class travel for short-haul flights, but retained cargo services on a small number of routes.\n\nA large order for A320 aircraft saw deliveries commencing in 2004 and continuing to 2011. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the withdrawal of the [[Boeing 737]].  On 29 October 2005, Aer Lingus withdrew its last two 737 aircraft from service, marking the end of Boeing aircraft at Aer Lingus, and the beginning of an all-Airbus fleet.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus announced its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as [[Dubai International Airport]] in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive [[Dermot Mannion]] was based when at [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].<ref name=privatise>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1027/aerlingus-business.html |title=RT\u00c9 Business: Aer Lingus must privatise in 2006: CEO |work=RT\u00c9 News |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing it as the first long-haul service outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to [[Montreal]] from 1966 to 1979.

These were used to expand long-haul operations as well as replace three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009. In, 2011 Aer Lingus switched their remaining three A330 orders to A350-900s, with delivery no sooner than 2017. The A350 orders were subsequently assumed by IAG in 2015.<ref name=\"fleet\">AerLingus corporate website detailing its [http://corporate.aerlingus.com/companyprofile/fleet/index.html current fleet of aircraft], visited: 3 July 2013</ref><ref name=\"IAG Capital Markets Day\">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzkzMjE1fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1&cb=636452658710557042|title=IAG Capital Markets Day|publisher=International Airlines Group|accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Flotation ====\n[[File:Wing 0587.JPG|thumb|The Aer Lingus logo painted on an Airbus A330 [[Wingtip device|winglet]].]]\n\nIn preparation for the commercial flotation of Aer Lingus on the Dublin stock market, the Irish government agreed to abolish the [[Shannon Airport#Shannon stopover|Shannon Stopover]] from the end of 2006 in stages.\n\nThe company began conditional (or \"grey-market\") share dealings on 27 September 2006 and was formally admitted to the Official Lists of the [[Irish Stock Exchange]] and [[London Stock Exchange]] on 2 October 2006.

Aer Lingus explained the move stating the carrier was repositioning as a low-cost carrier, which did not fit with Oneworld's pitch to the premium international frequent flyer.\n\nOn 6 February 2007, however, the airline announced its intention to form a new alliance with [[JetBlue]]. This new alliance was to act as a weblink between the two airlines, enabling Aer Lingus customers to book JetBlue destinations from the Aer Lingus website. In 2008, it also announced an alliance with [[United Airlines]] for connecting services within the US.\n\nWith the flotation of Aer Lingus on the stock exchange, Aer Lingus had planned to expand its route network, but this was put on hold due to the economic situation.\n\n==== First Ryanair takeover bid (2006) ====\nOn 5 October 2006, Ryanair launched a bid to buy Aer Lingus. Ryanair CEO [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]] said the move was a \"unique opportunity\" to form an Irish airline. The \"new\" airline would carry over 50&nbsp;million passengers a year. Ryanair said it had bought a 16% stake in Aer Lingus and was offering \u20ac2.80 for the remaining shares, a premium over the \u20ac2.20 the shares were trading for. The firm was trading at \u20ac1.13bn but Ryanair's offer valued it at \u20ac1.48bn.<ref name=Reject>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5408780.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Aer Lingus rejects Ryanair offer |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> On the same day Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair's takeover bid.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1005/ryanair-business.html |title=Aer Lingus says no as Ryanair ups stake |work=RT\u00c9 News |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> On 5 October 2006, Ryanair confirmed it had raised its stake to 19.2%, and said it had no problem in the Irish Government keeping its 28.3%.

Services from Belfast International commenced in December 2007. {{as of|2008|July}}, the airline had three [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] aircraft based at the airport, serving eleven European destinations. Significantly, this move restored the Belfast International to [[London Heathrow Airport]] link and Aer Lingus cooperated with its codeshare partner British Airways on this route to connect with BA's network at Heathrow. To do so, the airline discontinued its [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]-Heathrow service, a move that generated political controversy in the west of Ireland, particularly as the Shannon-London route was still profitable. The airline predicted that this move would add one million additional passengers annually.<ref name=Appeals>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0807/aerlingus-business.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Ryanair appeals to Government on Shannon |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=Belfast>{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastairport.com/en/content/4/58/airlines.html |publisher=Belfast International Airport |title=Airlines |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> The Shannon to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] service has since been reinstated.\n\nAfter five years at Belfast International Airport, Aer Lingus announced on 19 July 2012 that it would be moving its operations to [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]. The airline transferred its Belfast \u2013 London Heathrow flights to there, and also announced the operation of a thrice-daily London Gatwick service (no longer operated), and on 31 March 2013, launched services to Faro and [[M\u00e1laga]]. Aer Lingus based 2 aircraft in Belfast City Airport for the Winter 2012\u20132013 season and a third aircraft arrived for the Summer 2013 season.\n\n==== Open Skies ====\nOn 22 March 2007, as a result of the [[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement]], Aer Lingus announced three new long-haul services to the United States. From Autumn 2007, Aer Lingus commenced direct flights to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], San Francisco and Washington, D.C.-[[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], facilitated by the arrival of two new Airbus A330 aircraft in May 2007. The airline also serves [[Boston]] ([[Logan International Airport]]), Chicago ([[O'Hare International Airport]]), and New York ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]). Aer Lingus ended its Middle-Eastern Route to [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] in March 2008 and ended its Los Angeles route in November 2008. The [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the San Francisco routes were discontinued {{as of|2009|October|24|lc=y}}. Services from Washington, D.C. resumed on 28 March 2010 when the airline began flights from Washington D.C. to [[Madrid-Barajas Airport|Madrid]], Spain in a joint venture with United Airlines. The airline terminated this route on 30 October 2012.<ref name=Hancock>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0803/1224321365982.html|title=United terminates service with Aer Lingus to Madrid| work=The Irish Times| first=Ciar\u00e1n| last=Hancock| date=3 August 2012}}</ref> Services from San Francisco have since resumed on 2 April 2014. New Route: Dublin-Washington Aer Lingus has given details of its Summer 2015 schedule which includes the introduction of a new, four times weekly summer service from Dublin to Washington-Dulles starting May 2015.  The Dublin-Los Angeles route was reintroduced on 4 May 2016.\n\n==== Effects of global financial crisis ====\nAfter reporting losses of \u20ac22&nbsp;million for the first half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a \u20ac74&nbsp;million cost-saving plan. This was to involve up to 1,500 job cuts including the loss of cabin crew bases in Shannon and Heathrow. The plan included scaled background operations in Cork and Shannon Airports; outsourcing check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering services in Dublin; reduction in transatlantic services and replacing staff with US-based cabin crew; and a pay freeze through the end of 2009. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/unions-to-discuss-draconian-aer-lingus-cost-cutting-plan-380613.html |title=Unions to discuss 'draconian' Aer Lingus cost-cutting plan| work=Irish Examiner |accessdate=10 July 2015|date=7 October 2008}}</ref> These cutbacks have since been cancelled, and new cutbacks including lower pay and a change in working conditions for ground staff have been implemented.\n\nIn December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that the Shannon \u2013 Heathrow service would resume from 29 March 2009 following new arrangements with the trade unions on staff costs and the Shannon Airport Authority on airport charges.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus resumes Shannon-Heathrow route| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=22 December 2008| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| accessdate=1 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225030306/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| archivedate=25 December 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> However at the end of June 2009 the company had accumulated losses of \u20ac93&nbsp;million and Chairman Colm Barrington confirmed this situation could not continue.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus 'will look for pay cuts'| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=28 September 2009| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0828/aerlingus-business.html| accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> In October 2009, newly appointed Chief Executive Christoph Mueller announced a radical cost-cutting plan that would lead to the loss of 676 jobs at the company and see pay and pension reductions for those being retained.

Part of the aircraft's elevator spring tab was found some distance from the rest of the wreckage, suggesting that it had become detached at an earlier stage. However, the accident report reached no definitive conclusion about the cause of the crash but did not exclude the possibility that another aircraft or airborne object was involved. Following persistent rumours that the aircraft's demise was linked with nearby British military exercises, a review of the case files by the [[Air Accident Investigation Unit]] took place in 1998.

At the same time, the DH.84 Dragon was used to inaugurate an Aer Lingus service on the Dublin-Liverpool route.\n\nThe airline was established as the national carrier under the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]] (1936).<ref name=\"EI\" /> In 1937, the Irish government created Aer Rianta (now called [[Dublin Airport Authority]]), a company to assume financial responsibility for the new airline and the entire country's civil aviation infrastructure. In April 1937, Aer Lingus became wholly owned by the Irish government via Aer Rianta.\n\nThe airline's first General Manager was Dr J.F. (Jeremiah known as 'Jerry') Dempsey, a chartered accountant, who joined the company on secondment from Kennedy Crowley & Co (predecessor to [[KPMG]]) as Company Secretary in 1936 (aged 30) and was appointed to the role of General Manager in 1937. He retired 30 years later in 1967 at the age of 60.\n\nIn 1938, a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide]] replaced ''Iolar'', and the company purchased a second DH.86B. Two [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14s]] arrived in 1939, Aer Lingus' first all-metal aircraft.\n[[File:Aer Lingus DC-3 Manchester 1949.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus [[Douglas DC-3]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1948 wearing the first postwar livery.]]\n\nIn January 1940, a new airport opened in the Dublin suburb of Collinstown and Aer Lingus moved its operations there. It purchased a new [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] and inaugurated new services to [[Liverpool]] and an internal service to [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]. The airline's services were curtailed during World War II with the sole route being to Liverpool or [[City Airport Manchester|Barton Aerodrome]] Manchester depending on the fluctuating security situation.\n\n=== Post-war expansion ===\nOn 9 November 1945, regular services were resumed with an inaugural flight to London. From this point Aer Lingus aircraft, initially mostly [[Douglas DC-3]]s, were painted in a silver and green livery. The airline introduced its first flight attendants.\n\nIn 1946, a new Anglo-Irish agreement gave Aer Lingus exclusive UK traffic rights from Ireland in exchange for a 40% holding by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus' growth the airline bought seven new [[Vickers VC.1 Viking|Vickers Viking]] aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.\n[[File:Bristol 170.31 EI-AFS Aer Lingus Ringway 08.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Bristol 170 Freighter]] at Manchester Airport in 1953.]]\n\nIn 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann came into existence to operate [[transatlantic flight]]s to [[New York City]] from Ireland. The airline ordered five new [[Lockheed L-749 Constellation]]s, but a change of government and a financial crisis prevented the service from starting. [[John A Costello]], the incoming [[Fine Gael]] [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister), was not a keen supporter of air travel and thought that flying the Atlantic was too grandiose a scheme for a small airline from a small country like Ireland.<ref name=Garvin>{{cite book| title=Preventing the Future, Why Ireland Remained so Poor for so long| first=Tom| last=Garvin| date=13 September 2005| publisher=Gill & MacMillan, Ltd.| isbn=978-0-7171-3970-5}}</ref>\n[[File:Aer Lingus Viscount 808 Manchester 1963.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Viscount]] 808 in \"green top\" livery at Manchester Airport in 1963.]]\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, Aer Lingus introduced routes to [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]], [[Amsterdam Airport|Amsterdam]] via [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and to Rome. Because of the expanding route structure, the airline became one of the early purchasers of [[Vickers Viscount]] 700s in 1951, which were placed in service in April 1954. In 1952, the airline expanded its all-freight services and acquired a small fleet of [[Bristol 170 Freighter]]s, which remained in service until 1957.\n\nProf. [[Patrick Lynch (economist)|Patrick Lynch]] was appointed the chairman of Aer Lingus and [[Aer Rianta]] in 1954<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/top-irish-economist-patrick-lynch-dies-26251868.html|title=Top Irish economist Patrick Lynch dies|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-force-behind-country-s-economic-growth-in-the-60s-1.337754|title=A force behind country's economic growth in the 60s|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> and served in the position until 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/entertainment/niall-pioneers-definitive-book-on-national-airline-27774134.html|title=Niall pioneers definitive book on national airline|website=independent|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> In 1956, Aer Lingus introduced a new, green-top livery with a white lightning flash down the windows and the Irish flag displayed on the fin.\n\n=== First transatlantic service ===\n[[File:Boeing 720-048 EI-ALA Aer Lingus 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 720]] in Aer Lingus-Irish International livery in 1965.]]\n\nOn 28 April 1958, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann operated its first transatlantic service from [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] to New York. Three [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]]s were used for the twice-weekly service aboard aircraft leased from the US airline [[Seaboard World Airlines|Seaboard and Western]] with Irish cabin crews. This arrangement continued until 1 January 1960 when Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann was renamed Aer Lingus \u2013 Irish International Airlines.\n\nAer Lingus bought seven [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]s, which were delivered between November 1958 and May 1959. These were used in short-haul services to the UK, gradually replacing the Dakotas, until Aer Lingus disposed of them during 1966 in favour of secondhand Viscount 800s.\n\nThe airline entered the jet age on 14 December 1960 when it received three [[Boeing 720]] for use on the New York route and the newest Aer Lingus destination [[Boston]].\n\nIn 1963, Aer Lingus added [[Aviation Traders Carvair]]s to the fleet. These aircraft could transport five cars which were loaded into the fuselage through the nose of the aircraft. The Carvair proved to be uneconomical for the airline partly due to the rise of [[Roll-on/roll-off|auto ferry services]], and the aircraft were used for freight services until disposed of.\n\nThe Boeing 720s proved to be a success for the airline on the transatlantic routes. To supplement these, Aer Lingus took delivery of its first larger Boeing 707 in 1964, and the type continued to serve the airline until 1986.\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus Fokker Friendship Manchester 1965.jpg|thumb|A [[Fokker F27]] Friendship at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1965. The F27 was used on short-haul services between 1958 and 1966.]]\n\nConversion of the European fleet to jet equipment began in 1965 when the [[BAC One-Eleven]] started services from Dublin and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to Paris and via [[Manchester]] to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, D\u00fcsseldorf and Frankfurt. The airline adopted a new livery in the same year, with a large green [[shamrock (Irish symbol)|shamrock]] on the fin and titles of ''Aer Lingus-Irish International'' just above the windows. In 1966, the remainder of the company's shares held by [[Dublin Airport Authority|Aer Rianta]] were transferred to the [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]].\n[[File:Carvair and ambassador at bristol airport 1965 arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Aviation Traders Carvair]] that was used as a vehicle freighter is seen loading a car at [[Bristol Airport]] in 1964.]]\n\nIn 1966, the company inaugurated a route from Shannon to [[Montr\u00e9al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Montreal]] and onward to [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]]. In 1968, flights from [[Belfast]], in [[Northern Ireland]], to New York City started, however, it was soon suspended due to the beginning of [[the Troubles]]. Aer Lingus introduced [[Boeing 737]]s to its fleet in 1969 to cope with the high demand for flights between Dublin and London. Later, Aer Lingus extended the 737 flights to all of its European networks.\n\nIn 1967, after 30 years of service, General Manager Dr J.F. Dempsey signed the contract for the airline's first two [[Boeing 747]] aircraft before he retired later that year.\n\n=== 1970s to present ===\n[[File:Aer Lingus BAC 1-11 at Zurich - July 1975.jpg|thumb|A BAC One-Eleven in the old livery at [[Zurich Airport]], Switzerland in 1975.]]\nOn 6 March 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of the first of two [[Boeing 747]]s for use on the transatlantic routes.<ref>{{citation| url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1971112500009?opendocument| title=Supplementary Estimates, 1971\u201372 \u2013 Vote 41: Transport and Power| publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas| date=25 November 1971| volume=257| number=3| page=9| quote=The company took delivery of two Boeing 747s (Jumbos) in March 1971, and they went into service in April and May.

In 1974, Aer Lingus unveiled a new livery which eliminated the word ''International'' from the fuselage titles. The livery included two colours of blue and one green, plus the white shamrock on the fin.\n\nIn 1977, Aer Lingus recruited its first female pilot, [[Gr\u00e1inne Cronin]] \u2013 the airline was the second in Europe (after [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]) to introduce female pilots.<ref name=Murray>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0526/1224271143395.html |title=Permission to land first woman Aer Lingus pilot retires| work=The Irish Times| date=26 May 2010| last=Murray| first=Ken| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1979, Aer Lingus became the first European airline other than [[Alitalia]] to be used by [[Pope John Paul II]], when he flew aboard a specially modified Boeing 747 (EI-ASI or St. Patrick) from Rome to Dublin and later from Shannon to [[Boston]]. In the early 1980s, the 707s were phased out.\n\n[[File:Aer Lingus (EI-CFD), Dublin, February 1993.jpg|thumb|An Aer Lingus Commuter [[Saab 340]] at [[Dublin Airport]] in 1993.]]\n\nIn 1984, the airline formed a fully owned subsidiary, Aer Lingus Commuter, so that Aer Lingus could fly to larger cities in Ireland and Britain whose flying time from Dublin did not require jet aircraft. These services employed five of the Belfast-built [[Short 360]] after conducting a trial with the [[Short 330]]. Around this time Aer Lingus purchased a majority shareholding in the [[cargo airline]] [[Aer Turas]], owner of some [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] freighter jets.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, new [[Boeing 737]]s arrived to replace the older ones, and six [[Fokker 50]]s were added to the ''Commuter'' fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the deregulation act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its operational policies. It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four [[Saab 340]]Bs arrived at the commuter division to replace the [[Short 360]] aircraft. By 1992, Aer Lingus's entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world operating all three versions of the second-generation 737. These were the \u2212300, \u2212400 and \u2212500 series, although the \u2212300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.\n\n==== Airbus operations ====\n[[File:aerlingus.a321-200.ei-cpe.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Airbus A321]] landing at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 2007.]]\n\nIn 1994, Aer Lingus started direct services between Dublin and the United States using the [[Airbus A330]] and in May of that year, Aer Lingus operated the first A330-300 [[ETOPS]] service over the North Atlantic. This led to the phasing out of the [[Boeing 747]] and the briefly operated [[Boeing 767]]-300ER. On 2 October 1995, the Boeing 747 service ceased operations after twenty-five years of service. By that time, over eight million people had travelled across the Atlantic in Aer Lingus Boeing 747s. The late 1990s saw Aer Lingus return to [[Belfast]] with service to New York via Shannon.  It also added [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] as a destination, but discontinued these flights in 2001.\n\nThe first [[Airbus]] short-haul aircraft arrived in 1998 in the form of the [[Airbus A321|A321]], initially to mainly operate the Dublin-Heathrow route. Six were delivered in 1998 and 1999 and three of these continue in service today. The first [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] was delivered in 2000, with three more added to the fleet by 2001.\n\nOn 1 February 2001, Aer Lingus Commuter merged back into the mainline operation. The business was severely affected by the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].  In response, the airline cut staff numbers and destinations and reduced its fleet.  As a result, it weathered the storm and returned to profit, largely through lowering the airline's cost base, updating the fleet with modern Airbus equipment and developing new routes to mainland European destinations. Aer Lingus had previously largely neglected mainland Europe in favour of US and British destinations.  It positioned itself as competition to the European [[no frills|no-frills]] airlines while offering intercontinental flights, phased-out Business class travel for short-haul flights, but retained cargo services on a small number of routes.\n\nA large order for A320 aircraft saw deliveries commencing in 2004 and continuing to 2011. The delivery of these aircraft allowed the withdrawal of the [[Boeing 737]].  On 29 October 2005, Aer Lingus withdrew its last two 737 aircraft from service, marking the end of Boeing aircraft at Aer Lingus, and the beginning of an all-Airbus fleet.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus announced its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as [[Dubai International Airport]] in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive [[Dermot Mannion]] was based when at [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].<ref name=privatise>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1027/aerlingus-business.html |title=RT\u00c9 Business: Aer Lingus must privatise in 2006: CEO |work=RT\u00c9 News |date=27 October 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing it as the first long-haul service outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to [[Montreal]] from 1966 to 1979.

These were used to expand long-haul operations as well as replace three older models. Deliveries of the A330 began in February 2009. In, 2011 Aer Lingus switched their remaining three A330 orders to A350-900s, with delivery no sooner than 2017.

Services from Belfast International commenced in December 2007. {{as of|2008|July}}, the airline had three [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] aircraft based at the airport, serving eleven European destinations. Significantly, this move restored the Belfast International to [[London Heathrow Airport]] link and Aer Lingus cooperated with its codeshare partner British Airways on this route to connect with BA's network at Heathrow. To do so, the airline discontinued its [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]]-Heathrow service, a move that generated political controversy in the west of Ireland, particularly as the Shannon-London route was still profitable. The airline predicted that this move would add one million additional passengers annually.<ref name=Appeals>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0807/aerlingus-business.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Ryanair appeals to Government on Shannon |date=7 August 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=Belfast>{{cite web |url=http://www.belfastairport.com/en/content/4/58/airlines.html |publisher=Belfast International Airport |title=Airlines |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> The Shannon to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] service has since been reinstated.\n\nAfter five years at Belfast International Airport, Aer Lingus announced on 19 July 2012 that it would be moving its operations to [[George Best Belfast City Airport]]. The airline transferred its Belfast \u2013 London Heathrow flights to there, and also announced the operation of a thrice-daily London Gatwick service (no longer operated), and on 31 March 2013, launched services to Faro and [[M\u00e1laga]]. Aer Lingus based 2 aircraft in Belfast City Airport for the Winter 2012\u20132013 season and a third aircraft arrived for the Summer 2013 season.\n\n==== Open Skies ====\nOn 22 March 2007, as a result of the [[EU\u2013US Open Skies Agreement]], Aer Lingus announced three new long-haul services to the United States. From Autumn 2007, Aer Lingus commenced direct flights to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], San Francisco and Washington, D.C.-[[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], facilitated by the arrival of two new Airbus A330 aircraft in May 2007. The airline also serves [[Boston]] ([[Logan International Airport]]), Chicago ([[O'Hare International Airport]]), and New York ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]]). Aer Lingus ended its Middle-Eastern Route to [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai]] in March 2008 and ended its Los Angeles route in November 2008. The [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and the San Francisco routes were discontinued {{as of|2009|October|24|lc=y}}. Services from Washington, D.C. resumed on 28 March 2010 when the airline began flights from Washington D.C. to [[Madrid-Barajas Airport|Madrid]], Spain in a joint venture with United Airlines.

The Dublin-Los Angeles route was reintroduced on 4 May 2016.\n\n==== Effects of global financial crisis ====\nAfter reporting losses of \u20ac22&nbsp;million for the first half of the year, in October 2008, Aer Lingus announced a \u20ac74&nbsp;million cost-saving plan. This was to involve up to 1,500 job cuts including the loss of cabin crew bases in Shannon and Heathrow. The plan included scaled background operations in Cork and Shannon Airports; outsourcing check-in, baggage handling, cargo and catering services in Dublin; reduction in transatlantic services and replacing staff with US-based cabin crew; and a pay freeze through the end of 2009. This met with a largely negative response particularly from trade unions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/unions-to-discuss-draconian-aer-lingus-cost-cutting-plan-380613.html |title=Unions to discuss 'draconian' Aer Lingus cost-cutting plan| work=Irish Examiner |accessdate=10 July 2015|date=7 October 2008}}</ref> These cutbacks have since been cancelled, and new cutbacks including lower pay and a change in working conditions for ground staff have been implemented.\n\nIn December 2008, Aer Lingus announced that the Shannon \u2013 Heathrow service would resume from 29 March 2009 following new arrangements with the trade unions on staff costs and the Shannon Airport Authority on airport charges.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus resumes Shannon-Heathrow route| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=22 December 2008| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| accessdate=1 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225030306/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/aerlingus.html| archivedate=25 December 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> However at the end of June 2009 the company had accumulated losses of \u20ac93&nbsp;million and Chairman Colm Barrington confirmed this situation could not continue.<ref>{{cite news| title=Aer Lingus 'will look for pay cuts'| work=RT\u00c9 News| date=28 September 2009| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0828/aerlingus-business.html| accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref> In October 2009, newly appointed Chief Executive Christoph Mueller announced a radical cost-cutting plan that would lead to the loss of 676 jobs at the company and see pay and pension reductions for those being retained.

Part of the aircraft's elevator spring tab was found some distance from the rest of the wreckage, suggesting that it had become detached at an earlier stage. However, the accident report reached no definitive conclusion about the cause of the crash but did not exclude the possibility that another aircraft or airborne object was involved.

The criminalization of spousal rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted.

International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 \u2013 making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995.

In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.<ref>{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n====Forced marriage====\n{{main|Forced marriage}}\n[[File:Oskar Shmerling.

Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.\n\nVAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels<ref name=\"Youngs_368325\" /> and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish \"sanctuaries, shelters\" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called \"battered women\", from acts of violence. The term \"battered women\" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop \"innovative efforts\" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|88\u201389}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that \"women's rights are human rights\", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be \"[[Western world|Western]] concepts\" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|39}}\n\n=== Levels of activist movements ===\n[[File:Girl_Summit_-_22nd_July_in_London_(14498368279).jpg|thumb|250px|Poster against child and forced marriage]]\n[[File:Marcha_Ni_una_menos_1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Mass protest against violence against women in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2015]]\nOn the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to \"reexamine their attitudes and beliefs\" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these \"deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors\".<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 95\u2013109\"/> Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}</ref> An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 pp.96\"/> Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a \"raising voices\" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 pp.96\"/> In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" /> feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as \"a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern\".<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\nA number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the \"Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children\", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.<ref>{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = Review of African Political Economy | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nOn the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as \"transnational feminist networks\" or TFNs.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" /> Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\nOn an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on \"creating shared expectations\" within the domestic and regional levels as well as \"mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society\" to create \"standards in global civil society\".<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to \"a conference on women's rights\" by pushing for a \"stronger language and clearer recognition\" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called \"[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]\". This campaign \"calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls\".<ref name=\"UNiTE_Orange\">{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}</ref> Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be \"Orange Day\" or \"a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls\".<ref name=\"UNiTE_Orange\" />\n\nIn conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: \"1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights\" - on the national policies \"2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)\" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and \"3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions\" - on the international norms and agreements.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\n=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===\nOn the global level:\n* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.<ref name=\"Brown Thompson 2002\">{{cite book | last = Brown Thompson | first = Karen | chapter = Women's rights are human rights | editor-last1 = Khagram | editor-first1 = Sanjeev | editor-last2 = Riker | editor-first2 = James V. | editor-last3 = Sikkink | editor-first3 = Kathryn | title = Restructuring world politics: transnational social movements, networks, and norms | pages = 96&ndash;122 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816639076 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Elman | first = R.

The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for \"battered women\". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.\n\nCourts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.<ref name=\"Fried\" />\n\nInnovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.\n\n[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.<ref name=\"rainn.org\">{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.<ref name=\"Norway Post\" /> The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.<ref name=\"awid.org\"/>\n\n=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===\nThere can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.<ref name=\"Fried\" />\n\n*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced.

For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the \"two-finger test\" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is \"habituated to sex\". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called \"demeaning\", to be abolished, as it \"does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence\".

Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.\n*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers.

There are forms of violence which may be perpetrated or condoned by the government, such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]].

The criminalization of spousal rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.\n\nIn [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.<ref name=grady>{{cite book | last = Grady | first = William | title = Crime in Canadian context: debates and controversies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195433784 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Brennan | first1 = Shannon| last2 = Taylor-Butts | first2 = Andrea | title = Sexual assault in Canada, 2004 | publisher = Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics | location = Ottawa | year = 2008 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf | isbn = 9781100111636 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = SIECCAN |title=Sexual assault in Canada: what do we know? |publisher=The Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071229/http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | archive-date = 22 July 2014 |url=http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | date = October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] spousal rape was outlawed in 1990.<ref name=\"Temkin86\">{{cite book | last = Temkin | first = Jennifer | chapter = Defining and redefining rape | editor-last = Temkin | editor-first = Jennifer | title = Rape and the legal process | page = 86 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780198763543 }}\n:''Citing'':\n:* {{cite web | title = Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, section 5 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170429001010/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/32/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5 | archive-date = 29 April 2017 | url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1990/act/32/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5 | website = irishstatutebook.ie | publisher = [[Irish Statute Book]] | access-date = 21 December 2017}}</ref> In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal.<ref>{{cite news|last =Associated Press|author-link=Associated Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat=19930702&id=_xYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UOEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6288,228462 |title=N.C. the last state to outlaw marital rape |work=[[The Daily Gazette]]| location = New York |date=2 July 1993 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\nIn [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991.

International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 \u2013 making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\n====Diagnosis planning====\nThe [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s, which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.<ref name=\"Personality\">{{cite book| last1 = First | first1 = Michael B. | last2 = Bell | first2 = Carl C. | last3 = Cuthbert | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Krystal | first4 = John H. | last5 = Malison | first5 = Robert | last6 = Offord | first6 = David R. | last7 = Reiss | first7 = David | last8 = Shea | first8 = M.

Globally, there are more than 300.000 cases of maternal mortality yearly, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> \n\nDenial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system  for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]]. In some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Pr\u00fcgl, E.

Also, this wave is a transition of the fall communism<ref name=\"Krol\u00f8kke&S\u00f8rensen\" />{{rp|17}} to more complex issues of new kinds of 'warfare'{{Clarify|reason=What does this mean by \"warfare\"?

This new wave also \"embraces ambiguity\"<ref name=\"Krol\u00f8kke&S\u00f8rensen\" />{{rp|16}} and introduced a feminist approach of '[[intersectionality]]' that includes the issues of race, gender, age, and class.<ref name=\"Krol\u00f8kke&S\u00f8rensen\" />{{rp|17}} Other than that, the third wave marks a period of feminism dealing with [[identity politics]], body politics as well as the issues of violence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lind | first = Amy (Lecturer) | title = Gender and International Affairs 2013: International Feminist Movements | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people/faculty/lind | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 | access-date = 29 March 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181113125400/http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people%2Ffaculty%2Flind | archive-date = 13 November 2018 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a White Ribbon Day march (21614943268).jpg|thumb|[[Papua New Guinean]]s show their support for putting an end to [[Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea|violence against women]] during a [[White Ribbon Campaign|White Ribbon Day]] march]]\n\nNonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse<ref>{{cite book | last = Eng | first = Phoebe | author-link = Phoebe Eng | title = Stopping the violence against women: the movement from intervention to prevention | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf | page = 2 | publisher = [[Ms. Foundation for Women]] | location = New York | date = August 2005 | series = A Safety Program Report | access-date = 3 December 2013 }}</ref> and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on 'gender issues'<ref name=\"Pr\u00fcgl, E. Dec. 2013\" /> and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.\n\nVAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels<ref name=\"Youngs_368325\" /> and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish \"sanctuaries, shelters\" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called \"battered women\", from acts of violence. The term \"battered women\" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop \"innovative efforts\" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|88\u201389}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that \"women's rights are human rights\", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be \"[[Western world|Western]] concepts\" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|39}}\n\n=== Levels of activist movements ===\n[[File:Girl_Summit_-_22nd_July_in_London_(14498368279).jpg|thumb|250px|Poster against child and forced marriage]]\n[[File:Marcha_Ni_una_menos_1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Mass protest against violence against women in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2015]]\nOn the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to \"reexamine their attitudes and beliefs\" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these \"deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors\".<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 95\u2013109\"/> Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}</ref> An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 pp.96\"/> Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a \"raising voices\" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.<ref name=\"Michau, L. 2007 pp.96\"/> In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" /> feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as \"a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern\".<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\nA number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.<ref name=\"Fried\" />{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the \"Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children\", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.<ref>{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = Review of African Political Economy | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nOn the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as \"transnational feminist networks\" or TFNs.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" /> Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\nOn an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on \"creating shared expectations\" within the domestic and regional levels as well as \"mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society\" to create \"standards in global civil society\".<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to \"a conference on women's rights\" by pushing for a \"stronger language and clearer recognition\" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called \"[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]\". This campaign \"calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls\".<ref name=\"UNiTE_Orange\">{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}</ref> Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be \"Orange Day\" or \"a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls\".<ref name=\"UNiTE_Orange\" />\n\nIn conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: \"1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights\" - on the national policies \"2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)\" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and \"3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions\" - on the international norms and agreements.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n\n=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===\nOn the global level:\n* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.<ref name=\"Brown Thompson 2002\">{{cite book | last = Brown Thompson | first = Karen | chapter = Women's rights are human rights | editor-last1 = Khagram | editor-first1 = Sanjeev | editor-last2 = Riker | editor-first2 = James V. | editor-last3 = Sikkink | editor-first3 = Kathryn | title = Restructuring world politics: transnational social movements, networks, and norms | pages = 96&ndash;122 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816639076 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Elman | first = R.

As before the other human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did not focus on the issue of VAW and did not consider rape and domestic violence as violations of human rights despite of the fact that they also have agenda on women's rights.<ref name=\"Htun&Weldon\" />\n* The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing<ref>{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf |publisher=United Nations | date = 1995 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref> During the 4th Women Conference, VAW was emphasized and named as a critical concern.

International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.\n\nThe Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women \u2013 also known as the Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e0 Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | ref = harv | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121}}</ref> There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.<ref name=\"Fried\" />\n\n===Examples of measures put in place===\nAs violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for \"battered women\". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.\n\nCourts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.<ref name=\"Fried\" />\n\nInnovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.\n\n[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.<ref name=\"rainn.org\">{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.<ref name=\"Norway Post\" /> The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.<ref name=\"awid.org\"/>\n\n=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===\nThere can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.<ref name=\"Fried\" />\n\n*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.\n*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence.

For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the \"two-finger test\" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is \"habituated to sex\". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called \"demeaning\", to be abolished, as it \"does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence\".

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.\n*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.\n*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers.

He then went on to play at [[East Central University]] in [[Ada, Oklahoma]], where he was a two-time All-[[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] defensive back. After graduation from East Central, Graham had a brief stint with the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[NFL]].<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Arizona-State-coach-Todd-Graham-talks-Pittsburgh-Territorial-Cup-and-loyalty-to-Tempe-050112</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nGraham began his coaching career in 1988 as an assistant at [[Poteet High School (Mesquite, Texas)|Poteet High School]] in his hometown of Mesquite. He later held head coaching positions at [[Carl Albert High School]] in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]], and [[Allen High School (Allen, Texas)|Allen High School]] in [[Allen, Texas]] before becoming linebackers coach under [[Rich Rodriguez]] at [[West Virginia University]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/1646/head-football-coach-todd-graham-happy-to-be-at-tu Head Football Coach Todd Graham Happy to be at TU]</ref> The following season Graham was assigned to defensive co-coordinator.\n\nIn 2003, he was hired by [[Steve Kragthorpe]] as the defensive coordinator at Tulsa, where he helped guide the Golden Hurricane to two bowl games in three seasons. Graham built one of the best defensive units in [[Conference USA]] and the nation before leaving the position following his third year at Tulsa for his first head coaching stint.\n\n===Rice===\nGraham was hired as the head coach at Rice on January 1, 2006.<ref name=\"Rice bio\">{{cite web|title=Todd Graham|url=http://www.riceowls.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|publisher=Rice University Athletics|accessdate=April 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103194809/http://riceowls.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|archivedate=January 3, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> This followed the resignation of long-time coach [[Ken Hatfield]] after the Owls had finished 1\u201310 in 2005. At Rice, athletic director Chris Del Conte helped Graham raise $5.5 million for renovating [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] and replacing the dated [[AstroTurf]] with [[FieldTurf]]. He hired former [[University of Texas]] quarterback [[Major Applewhite]] as his offensive coordinator,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2284752 Applewhite named offensive coordinator at Rice]</ref> replacing the [[triple option offense]] Hatfield had been running with a more balanced attack.

Graham received much criticism for this move.  On November 24, 2007, when Tulsa played Rice at [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]], the Rice University [[Marching Owl Band]] presented a [[halftime show]] named \"Todd Graham's Inferno\"<ref>[http://mob.rice.edu/history/scripts/2007/Nov24_Tulsa.shtml Todd Graham's Inferno]</ref> (based on Dante's \"[[The Divine Comedy]]\").  This resulted in a formal protest to [[Conference USA]] by Tulsa's athletic department. Chuck Throckmorton, the marching band's director, later apologized for offending anyone, but not for the show.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3129832 Rice band's 'Todd Graham's Inferno' not a hit with Tulsa],</ref><ref>[https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5335557.html Rice band director apologizes for Graham routine]</ref>  Following Graham's exodus, Rice hired [[David Bailiff]], who led Rice to its [[2008 Texas Bowl]], and its [[2012 Armed Forces Bowl]] and the 2013 Conference USA title.\n\n===Tulsa===\n\nWhen the Tulsa head coaching position was vacant following the 2002 season, Todd Graham sent in his application.

Graham has served as the head football coach at [[Rice University]] (2006), the [[University of Tulsa]] (2007\u20132010), the [[University of Pittsburgh]] (2011) and [[Arizona State University]] (2012\u20132017).\n\n==Playing career==\nGraham was an all-district defensive back at [[North Mesquite High School]], from which he graduated in 1983. He then went on to play at [[East Central University]] in [[Ada, Oklahoma]], where he was a two-time All-[[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] defensive back. After graduation from East Central, Graham had a brief stint with the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[NFL]].<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Arizona-State-coach-Todd-Graham-talks-Pittsburgh-Territorial-Cup-and-loyalty-to-Tempe-050112</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\nGraham began his coaching career in 1988 as an assistant at [[Poteet High School (Mesquite, Texas)|Poteet High School]] in his hometown of Mesquite. He later held head coaching positions at [[Carl Albert High School]] in [[Midwest City, Oklahoma]], and [[Allen High School (Allen, Texas)|Allen High School]] in [[Allen, Texas]] before becoming linebackers coach under [[Rich Rodriguez]] at [[West Virginia University]] in 2001.<ref>[http://www.gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/1646/head-football-coach-todd-graham-happy-to-be-at-tu Head Football Coach Todd Graham Happy to be at TU]</ref> The following season Graham was assigned to defensive co-coordinator.\n\nIn 2003, he was hired by [[Steve Kragthorpe]] as the defensive coordinator at Tulsa, where he helped guide the Golden Hurricane to two bowl games in three seasons. Graham built one of the best defensive units in [[Conference USA]] and the nation before leaving the position following his third year at Tulsa for his first head coaching stint.\n\n===Rice===\nGraham was hired as the head coach at Rice on January 1, 2006.<ref name=\"Rice bio\">{{cite web|title=Todd Graham|url=http://www.riceowls.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|publisher=Rice University Athletics|accessdate=April 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103194809/http://riceowls.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|archivedate=January 3, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> This followed the resignation of long-time coach [[Ken Hatfield]] after the Owls had finished 1\u201310 in 2005. At Rice, athletic director Chris Del Conte helped Graham raise $5.5 million for renovating [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]] and replacing the dated [[AstroTurf]] with [[FieldTurf]]. He hired former [[University of Texas]] quarterback [[Major Applewhite]] as his offensive coordinator,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2284752 Applewhite named offensive coordinator at Rice]</ref> replacing the [[triple option offense]] Hatfield had been running with a more balanced attack. Behind quarterback Chase Clement and All-American receiver [[Jarett Dillard]], Rice pulled off the biggest turnaround of the 2006 season, finishing 7\u20135 and earning an invitation to the [[New Orleans Bowl]], the school's first bowl game since 1961.<ref name=\"Rice bio\"/> Graham was named [[Conference USA]] Coach of the Year, and was rewarded by the Rice administration with the offer of a significant pay raise and contract extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.ricethresher.org/sports/2007/01/12/graham_contract_extension|title=Graham strikes deal in contract extension|work=The Rice Thresher|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714194404/http://the.ricethresher.org/sports/2007/01/12/graham_contract_extension|archivedate=July 14, 2007}}</ref>  After signing this extension, Graham left for Tulsa only a few days later.  Graham received much criticism for this move.  On November 24, 2007, when Tulsa played Rice at [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice Stadium]], the Rice University [[Marching Owl Band]] presented a [[halftime show]] named \"Todd Graham's Inferno\"<ref>[http://mob.rice.edu/history/scripts/2007/Nov24_Tulsa.shtml Todd Graham's Inferno]</ref> (based on Dante's \"[[The Divine Comedy]]\").  This resulted in a formal protest to [[Conference USA]] by Tulsa's athletic department. Chuck Throckmorton, the marching band's director, later apologized for offending anyone, but not for the show.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3129832 Rice band's 'Todd Graham's Inferno' not a hit with Tulsa],</ref><ref>[https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5335557.html Rice band director apologizes for Graham routine]</ref>  Following Graham's exodus, Rice hired [[David Bailiff]], who led Rice to its [[2008 Texas Bowl]], and its [[2012 Armed Forces Bowl]] and the 2013 Conference USA title.\n\n===Tulsa===\n\nWhen the Tulsa head coaching position was vacant following the 2002 season, Todd Graham sent in his application. But it was not until five years later that Graham would take over the reins as the Golden Hurricane head coach. After serving three years as Tulsa defensive coordinator and one year as Rice head coach, Graham was introduced as Tulsa's 27th head football coach on January 12, 2007.<ref name=\"Tulsa bio\">{{cite web|title=Todd Graham|url=http://www.tulsahurricane.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|publisher=Tulsa University Athletics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717112154/http://www.tulsahurricane.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor his offensive coordinators, Graham turned to his good friend [[Gus Malzahn]], then offensive coordinator at the [[University of Arkansas]],<ref>[http://www.kait8.com/global/story.asp?s=5941114&ClientType=Printable Gus Malzahn Leaves Arkansas]</ref> as well as then WVU [[tight end]]s coach Herb Hand.<ref>[http://westvirginia.scout.com/2/609200.html Hand Leaves West Virginia For Tulsa]</ref> He also hired former Tulsa quarterback and [[Union Public Schools|Tulsa Union HS]] coach [[Bill Blankenship]] as wide receivers coach.\n\nWith an annual salary of $1.1 million Graham was the second highest-paid coach in  [[Conference USA]], behind SMU's [[June Jones]] in 2010.\n\nIn his final season at Tulsa, the team reached a 10\u20133 record that included a 28\u201327 upset at [[2010 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] and 62\u201335 win over #24-ranked [[2010 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii]] in the [[2010 Hawaii Bowl]].<ref name=\"Pitt bio\">{{cite web|title=Todd Graham|url=http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Athletics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227134244/http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/graham_todd00.html|archivedate=December 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Pitt===\nGraham was announced as Pitt's head coach on January 10, 2011,<ref name=\"Pitt bio\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://post-gazette.com/pg/11011/1117054-233.stm | title=Pitt's search ends with hiring of Tulsa's Graham |first=Paul | last=Zeise | first2=Bill | last2=Brink | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2010-01-11 | accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> and subsequently led the team to a disappointing 6\u20136 regular season later that fall.
