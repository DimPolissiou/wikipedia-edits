{"title_page": "William McKendree", "text_new": "{{infobox person/Wikidata|fetchwikidata=ALL}}\n\n'''William McKendree''' (July 6, 1757 \u2013 March 5, 1835) was an Evangelist and the fourth Bishop of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], and the first Methodist [[bishop]] born in [[the United States]].  He was elected in 1808.\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam was born in [[King William County, Virginia]], the son of John and Mary McKendree.  His parents were both of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.\n\nAs a young man, McKendree served in the [[Virginia militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He entered the ranks as a [[Private (rank)|private]], but eventually served as an [[adjutant]] in the [[commissary]] department.  He was present at the [[siege of Yorktown]] and the surrender of [[Lord Cornwallis]]. After the war, he returned to private life.\n\nWilliam was [[Christian conversion|converted to Christ]] in 1787.  Shortly thereafter he began conversing with his friends on the subject of the [[Christian faith]] and making them the subjects of his fervent [[prayers]]. He soon volunteered to take part in public religious meetings, and his addresses produced a powerful effect.\n\n==Ministry==\nIn 1788, while living in [[Brunswick County, Virginia]], William was received on trial into the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Unusually, he was admitted without first obtaining a [[License to Preach (Methodist)|License to Preach]] and without anyone's recommendation.  Bishop [[Francis Asbury]] appointed him as junior [[preacher]] to [[Mecklenburg County, Virginia|Mecklenburg]] circuit and he served for several years on neighboring circuits.\n\nThe Rev. McKendree continued as an [[itinerant preacher]] until November 1792, when, having been influenced by [[James O'Kelly]] to join in certain measures of pretended [[reform]], he was greatly disappointed by their failure at the General Conference.  Mr. O'Kelly withdrew from the M.E. Church.  Mr. McKendree, sympathizing with him, sent in his resignation as a minister.  But the Conference agreed that he might still preach among the Methodist societies.\n\nRev. McKendree soon obtained leave to travel with Bishop Asbury, that he might ascertain for himself whether his impressions had been well founded.  In a short time he was convinced he had been deceived.  He therefore devoted himself to a careful examination of the Rules and Discipline of the Church as drawn up by [[John Wesley]], and as established by the General Conference in the U.S.A.  McKendree became fully convinced both of their harmony with the primitive church and of their particular adaptedness to the circumstances and wants of this nation.\n\nIn 1793 the Rev. McKendree was sent to [[South Carolina]], but returned the next year. For the next three years, his circuit was vast&mdash;extending from [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] and [[Alleghany Mountains]].  In 1796 he became Presiding Elder.  In 1798, he was appointed to the Baltimore conference, and in 1800 he went with Bishop Asbury and Bishop [[Richard Whatcoat]] to the Western Conference, which met that year at [[Bethel, Kentucky]].\n\nRev. McKendree was appointed the Presiding Elder of the Kentucky-Holston District, 1800-01.  In 1801, the conference sent McKendree to oversee the church's efforts in Southeastern [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and western [[Virginia]] and part of [[Illinois]].  He subsequently became Presiding Elder on the [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] District.  He served as a circuit preacher in addition to his organizational efforts, becoming a respected figure in the region.  He was the leader of the [[Second Great Awakening|Great Revival]] in the West.\n\n==As bishop==\nThe Rev. William McKendree became widely know and most highly esteemed because of his popular talents in the pulpit and his faithful attention to every part of his work.  Consequently, the 1808 General Conference of the M.E. Church, meeting in Baltimore, elected him to the office of Bishop.  Indeed, when called to preach before the General Conference, such was the power and [[unction]] connected with his [[sermon]], that Bishop Asbury was quoted as having said at its close, \"That sermon will make McKendree bishop.\"\n\nFrom that time, then, Bishop McKendree traveled with Bishop Asbury, or alone, over every part of the Church.  His first episcopal tour of 1,500 miles extended through Virginia, Tennessee, [[Missouri]], and Illinois.  After 1816 he was Senior Bishop for nineteen years.  In 1830, he lent his support to the Lebanon Seminary, [[Lebanon, Illinois]]. As a result, the school chose to change its name to [[McKendree College]] (later University).\n\nBishop McKendree never married.  His family had moved to [[Sumner County, Tennessee]] about 1810. So when the bishop was not traveling, he also called that area home. He died 5 March 1835 at the home of his brother, Dr. James McKendree, in Sumner County near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. One of his last expressions was said to have been, \"All is well.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nBishop Matthew Simpson wrote of Bishop McKendree:\n<blockquote>He was a man of great energy and genius, and was deeply pious and modest almost to timidity.  His mind was clear and logical, his knowledge varied and extensive, his imagination lively but well regulated, and his eloquence was unusually powerful.  He was careful in the administration of discipline, and intruduced system into all the operations of the church.</blockquote>\n\nBishop McKendree's influence was patent everywhere, but especially was he regarded in the West.  He had given years of earnest labor to establishing Methodism on the western frontier. He therefore felt a deep and abiding interest in the success thereof. He thus earned the nickname \"Father of Western Methodism\", and was considered one of the greatest Bishops of the M.E. Church.\n\nPeople named for Bishop McKendree include [[William McKendree Springer]], [[William McKendree Robbins]], [[William McKendree Gwin]] and James McKendree Reiley's son William McKendree Reiley.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bishops of the United Methodist Church]]\n\n==References==\n*Leete, Frederick DeLand.

The typical standby power per appliance is low (typically from less than 1 to 25&nbsp;W), but, when multiplied by the billions of appliances in houses and in commercial buildings, standby losses represent a significant fraction of total world electricity use.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/795944-XFu5mJ/native/795944.pdf One Watt Initiative : a Global Effort to Reduce Leaking Electricity] Alan Meier & Beno\u00eet LeBot, 1999</ref> According to Alan Meier, a staff scientist at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], standby power before the One Watt Initiative proposals were implemented as regulations accounted for as much as 10% of household power consumption.

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. In June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K.

San and the Afiara Quartet provide live scoring on piano, strings and turntables.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\"/> San also has another project debuting at Luminato Festival entitled ''[[The Lost Train]]'', a collaboration between San and Joe Beef's Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin. The two joined together to create a series of \"imaginary journeys with real food and music\", inspired by their respective passion for trains. Taking place at a secret location, the experience will remain a mystery with the guests being taken to an undisclosed location, and will feature a specially created course by Morin and a live set of entirely new material by Kid Koala.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419042641/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/Lost-Train|title=The Lost Train - Luminato Festival 2014|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nSan popularized a method of playing the turntable like a melodic instrument, where a long, single note is dragged under the needle at different speeds, creating different pitches. Since this method of adjusting pitch is imprecise, the resulting notes waver and bend. Thus, in the song \"Drunk Trumpet,\" San uses this method with a trumpet note to simulate a drunken trumpet player, interspersing drunken vocals to complete the effect.\n\nWhen playing live, San often uses records cut with custom sounds from which he creates his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistxite.com/us/magazine/interviews/98385/Interview-with-Kid-Koala-I-consider-myself-one-of-the-worst-DJs-in-the-world.html|title=Interview with Kid Koala : \"I consider myself one of the worst DJs in the world!\"|website=Artistxite.com|accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nSan released the Kid Koala album, entitled ''[[Your Mom's Favorite DJ]]'' (ZENCD127), on 25 September 2006.\n\nAs of October 2006 San was married and had recently embarked on a 90-city tour.\n\nIn 2008 he toured as the opening performer for [[DJ Shadow]] & [[Cut Chemist]]'s \"[[The Hard Sell]]\" tour where he ended his set with a now legendary mix of \"Moon River\" where he essentially creates and edits in an extended violin solo by playing various long violin notes from the song's instrumental section at different pitches on four turntables, all live.\n\nDuring San Diego [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2010, Kid Koala performed before a special free showing of the movie ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''. The next year at Comic-Con, he performed before a special premiere of the television series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''.\n\nIn June 2013, his studio album ''12 bit Blues'' was longlisted for the [[2013 Polaris Music Prize]].\n\nIn early 2017, San released an album, ''Music to Draw To: Satellite'', in collaboration with Icelandic singer [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]].

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. In June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K. Barrett, recently Oscar-nominated for ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'', this live adaptation of the graphic novel unfolds via a real-time filming of more than a dozen miniature stages and a cast of puppets. San and the Afiara Quartet provide live scoring on piano, strings and turntables.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\"/> San also has another project debuting at Luminato Festival entitled ''[[The Lost Train]]'', a collaboration between San and Joe Beef's Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin. The two joined together to create a series of \"imaginary journeys with real food and music\", inspired by their respective passion for trains. Taking place at a secret location, the experience will remain a mystery with the guests being taken to an undisclosed location, and will feature a specially created course by Morin and a live set of entirely new material by Kid Koala.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419042641/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/Lost-Train|title=The Lost Train - Luminato Festival 2014|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nSan popularized a method of playing the turntable like a melodic instrument, where a long, single note is dragged under the needle at different speeds, creating different pitches. Since this method of adjusting pitch is imprecise, the resulting notes waver and bend. Thus, in the song \"Drunk Trumpet,\" San uses this method with a trumpet note to simulate a drunken trumpet player, interspersing drunken vocals to complete the effect.\n\nWhen playing live, San often uses records cut with custom sounds from which he creates his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistxite.com/us/magazine/interviews/98385/Interview-with-Kid-Koala-I-consider-myself-one-of-the-worst-DJs-in-the-world.html|title=Interview with Kid Koala : \"I consider myself one of the worst DJs in the world!\"|website=Artistxite.com|accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nSan released the Kid Koala album, entitled ''[[Your Mom's Favorite DJ]]'' (ZENCD127), on 25 September 2006.\n\nAs of October 2006 San was married and had recently embarked on a 90-city tour.\n\nIn 2008 he toured as the opening performer for [[DJ Shadow]] & [[Cut Chemist]]'s \"[[The Hard Sell]]\" tour where he ended his set with a now legendary mix of \"Moon River\" where he essentially creates and edits in an extended violin solo by playing various long violin notes from the song's instrumental section at different pitches on four turntables, all live.\n\nDuring San Diego [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2010, Kid Koala performed before a special free showing of the movie ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''. The next year at Comic-Con, he performed before a special premiere of the television series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''.\n\nIn June 2013, his studio album ''12 bit Blues'' was longlisted for the [[2013 Polaris Music Prize]].\n\nIn early 2017, San released an album, ''Music to Draw To: Satellite'', in collaboration with Icelandic singer [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]]. He released a follow-up in early 2019, ''Music to Draw To: Io'', in collaboration with Belgian singer [[Trixie Whitley]].<ref>{{cite news|author=T'Cha Dunlevy |url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/kid-koala-puts-all-hands-on-deck-for-satellite-concert |title=Kid Koala puts all hands on deck for Satellite Concert |newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=2017-01-25 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Janine Coppola |url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2018/12/16/news/kid-koala-releases-allotropic-off-new-album-music-to-draw-out-january-2019/ |title=Kid Koala Releases \u201cAllotropic\u201d Off New Album Music To Draw Out January 2019 |website=Mxdwn.com |date=2018-12-16 |accessdate=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Solo projects===\n====Albums====\n* 1996: ''[[Scratchcratchratchatch]]'' - mixtape demo album, limited to 500 copies and initially released on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] only.\n* 2000: ''[[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (album)|Carpal Tunnel Syndrome]]''\n* 2003: ''[[Some of My Best Friends Are DJs]]''\n* 2006: ''[[Your Mom's Favorite DJ]]''\n* 2012: ''[[12 Bit Blues]]''\n* 2017: ''Music to Draw To: Satellite''<ref name=star>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2017/01/26/kid-koala-draws-upon-the-winter-for-new-album.html \"Kid Koala draws upon the winter for new album\"].
