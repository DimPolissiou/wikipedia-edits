The Chincha had developed systems of architecture, agriculture and irrigation. The Chincha culture came to dominate the whole valley. The Chincha worshiped a jaguar god, and believed themselves to be descended from jaguars, who gave them their warlike and dominating tendencies. The Chincha fertilized their fields with dead birds and [[guano]], and this knowledge was passed on to later peoples. The Chincha merchants maintained trade routes by land with herds of [[Llama|camelids]] used as beasts of burden reaching the [[Andean Plateau|Collao]] (Altiplano) and [[Cusco Region|Cusco]].

{"title_page": "Expanding monomer", "text_new": "'''Expanding monomers''' are [[monomers]] which increase in volume (expand) during [[polymerization]]. They can be added to monomer [[formulation]]s to counteract the usual volume shrinking (during polymerization) to manufacture products with higher quality and durability. Volume Shrinkage is in first line for the unmeltable [[thermoset]]s a problem, since those are of fixed shape after polymerization completed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Expanding Monomers: Synthesis, Charakterization and Applications|last = Sadhir|first = Rajender K.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1992|isbn = 0-8493-5156-1|location = |pages = }}</ref>{{rp|2}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe quality of [[thermoset]]s ([[crosslinked]] polymers) is determined by a numerous factors such as the purity of the used monomer, polymerization time and [[temperature]], [[stoichiometry]] of [[comonomer]]s (when used) or type and quantity of [[catalyst]] or initiator. Another rarely minded factor is the volume shrinking (and density increase) during polymerization; actually all polymers are shrinking during polymerization to some degree. This volume shrinkage can lead (after the [[gel point]]) to [[mechanical stress]] within the polymer (internal stress), which may cause [[microfracture]]s, worse mechanical properties or detaching form the [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]. Expandable monomers occupy after polymerization a greater volume than before and were designed to counteract the volumetric shrinkage upon addition. For other applications, like [[precision casting]]s or [[dental fillings]], a slight expansion during polymerization would be desirable for complete filling of a given [[mold]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}. Nonetheless, for some applications even a small shrinkage can be desirable as for [[one-piece mold]]s, to accomplish an easy removal. Expanding monomers are used to influence respectively control the volume change during the polymerization.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|3}}\n\n=== Reason for shrinkage ===\nShrinkage is observed during both, the polymerization and the crosslinking ([[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]) of monomers. This volume shrinkage is caused by various factors. The main reason is that the monomers are moving from [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] distance to [[covalent]] distance when a covalent bond is formed during [[polymerization]]. This can be emphasized for the example of the [[ethene]] polymerization.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|23}}\n\n[[File:Distance polymerization.svg|upright=2.5|frameless|The distance change during polymerization. The result is a shrinkage.]]\n\nIt can be seen that the distance between to monomers changes from van der Waals distance (3.40 \u00c5) to covalent distance of a [[single bond]] (1.54 \u00c5), leading to a net change of -1.86 \u00c5. The change from [[double bond]] (1.34 \u00c5) to a single bond (again 1.54 \u00c5) results in a slight expansion (+0.2 \u00c5). Both effects added up are still resulting in remarkable shrinkage.\n\nA minor role is playing furthermore the [[entropy]] change while polymerization and the [[package density]], as the polymer is more closely packed than the monomer. In [[step-growth polymerization]] (condensation reaction) small molecules are eliminated, which are also contributing to shrinkage when removed. At elevated temperatures also the [[thermal aging]] plays a role, where unreacted monomer can polymerize and degradation products and other small molecules are released.\n\n=== Conventional methods for shrinkage reduction ===\nConsiderable research has been done to reduce shrinkage during polymerization. As methods the addition of fillers, the use of [[prepolymer]]s, the addition of [[reactive diluent]]s and special [[crosslinking agent]]s are conventionally used. It is a general rule that the lower the reactive portion, the lower the shrinkage of the resin is during polymerization.\n\nFillers (silica, mica, quartz, etc.) are reducing the shrinkage in proportion to the used amount since the volume stable filler replaces the shrinking polymer. The viscosity increase which is caused by fillers is disadvantageous since it restricts the flow of [[resins]] and mold fill. Furthermore, problematic is their tendency of [[settling]].\n\nPrepolymers did undergo polymerization already to some extent. However, they are still viscous and not yet gelatinised. As prepolymers are already partially polymerized the shrinking is therefore reduced during the final cure. The higher the molecular weight of the used monomers the lower the shrinkage in volume.\n\nAlso the addition of reactive diluents can reduce the shrinkage in proportion to the extent of its addition.\n\n== Concept of expanding monomers ==\n\n=== Ring effects ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n!Number of \ncarbon atoms\n!Linear hydrocarbon \ndensity (g\u22c5cm<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n!\nCyclic hydrocarbon\n\ndensity (g\u22c5cm<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n!Density \ndifference\n|-\n|4\n|0.5788\n|0.6820\n|<nowiki>-0.1032</nowiki>\n|-\n|6\n|0.6603\n|0.7791\n|<nowiki>-0.1188</nowiki>\n|-\n|8\n|0.7028\n|0.8337\n|<nowiki>-0.1304</nowiki>\n|-\n|10\n|0.7310\n|0.8580\n|<nowiki>-0.1270</nowiki>\n|}\n\nThe expanding monomers were developed on the observation that the shrinkage during ring-opening polymerization is lower than in any other kind of polymerization:<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|24}}\n:[[ring-opening polymerization]] > [[chain growth polymerization]] > [[Step-growth polymerization|step]]-growth\n\nThis is mainly based on the fact that [[cyclic compounds]] are possessing higher [[Density|densities]] than their linear counterparts. This can be illustrated by a comparison of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons (see table). A hypothetical ring-opening process of [[cyclobutane]] to [[butane|n-butane]] would result in a volumen expansion of approximately 15%. The polymerization of a cyclic compound causes therefore a smaller volume shrinkage because cyclic compounds are already relatively dense.\n\nIt can be furthermore seen that the larger the ring, the larger the expansion. This first effect is called ring size effect. However, when the cyclic hydrocarbons would be hypothetically polymerized (to [[polyethelene]]), still a volume shrinking would appear overall (as polyethelene has a density of 0.92 g\u22c5cm-<sup>3</sup>). Nevertheless, this shrinking would be reduced with increasing ring length.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|27}}\n\nHowever, for a real polymerization also the [[ring strain]] has to be kept in mind. The ring strain is reduced with increasing ring size and reaches near zero in cyclohexane. This can be illustrated with the fact that [[ethylene oxide|oxirane]] polymerizes readily while [[Tetrahydrofuran|oxolane]] is by far less reactive.\n\n[[File:Density change polymerization.svg|upright=2.0|frameless|right]]\n\nA second effect is the ring per unit volume effect. The volume change during ring-opening polymerization is also influenced by the number of polymerizable rings per monomer. This can be illustrated for the example of cyclopentene, the cyclopentene dimer, [[adamantane]] and [[poly(cyclopentene)]]. It can be seen that hypothetical conversion of cyclopentene to poly(cyclopentene) would result in volume shrinkage of 15.38%, while the conversion of cyclopentene dimer leads to expansion of 5.21% and the conversion of adamantane even to expansion of 14.15%.\n\nThe third effect is the ring-opening effect which can be illustrated at the polymerization of oxirane. During the polymerization two molecules are moving from van der Waals distance to covalent distance, what would result taken alone in shrinkage of approximately 40% (as it has been visualized above).<ref>Even though the change from a van der Waals dinstance (3.4 \u00c5) to a single carbon-carbon bond (1.54 \u00c5) is about 55 %, it been taken in relation with the size of the whole molecule, which results in a shrinkage of just 40 instead of 55 %. This explains also why the shrinking is reduced with increasing molecular weight</ref> At the same time the ring opens and moves from covalent distance to near van der Waals distance, this would result in an expansion of 17%. Thus, the overall volume change is a shrinkage of about 23%.\n\nThis minor shrinking during the ring-opening polymerization itself depends on the ring size effect, the number of rings per volume effect and the ring-opening effect.\n\n=== Expanding monomer concept ===\nDerived from the ring effects the design of the expanding monomers is based on [[bicyclic compound]]s. A net expansion is reached when for each bond which undergoes a shift from covalent to van der Waals distance at least two bonds are shifting from covalent to near van der Waals distance, as it is shown in the following picture.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|32}}\n\n[[File:Concept Expanding Monomers.svg|upright=2.0|frameless|Shown is the concept of expanding monomers.]]\n\nIt can be seen that bond <span style=\"color:#6F7C91\">a)</span> and bond <span style=\"color:#5500D4\">b)</span> are broken and changing therefore from covalent to near van der Waals distance. At the same time is bond <span style=\"color:#2CA089\">c)</span> is formed between two monomers, which is a change from van der waals distance to covalent distance.\n\nIt follows the three requirements that the rings of the bicyclic monomer are fused (the rings are sharing at least one atom), that each ring contains at least one non-carbon atom and that the rings are opening in asymmetrical manner (meaning for example that one oxygen forms an carbonyl group and one an ether group). Compound classes which are fulfilling these requirements are spiro orthoesters, spiro orthocarbonates, bicyclic ketal lactones and bicyclic orthoesters.\n\n== Overview, synthesis and polymerization  ==\nMost expanding monomers are [[orthoester]]s, either spiro orthoesters, bicyclic orthoesters or orthocarbonates.

Another rarely minded factor is the volume shrinking (and density increase) during polymerization; actually all polymers are shrinking during polymerization to some degree. This volume shrinkage can lead (after the [[gel point]]) to [[mechanical stress]] within the polymer (internal stress), which may cause [[microfracture]]s, worse mechanical properties or detaching form the [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]. Expandable monomers occupy after polymerization a greater volume than before and were designed to counteract the volumetric shrinkage upon addition. For other applications, like [[precision casting]]s or [[dental fillings]], a slight expansion during polymerization would be desirable for complete filling of a given [[mold]]. Nonetheless, for some applications even a small shrinkage can be desirable as for [[one-piece mold]]s, to accomplish an easy removal. Expanding monomers are used to influence respectively control the volume change during the polymerization.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|3}}\n\n=== Reason for shrinkage ===\nShrinkage is observed during both, the polymerization and the crosslinking ([[Curing (chemistry)|curing]]) of monomers. This volume shrinkage is caused by various factors. The main reason is that the monomers are moving from [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] distance to [[covalent]] distance when a covalent bond is formed during [[polymerization]]. This can be emphasized for the example of the [[ethene]] polymerization.<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|23}}\n\n[[File:Distance polymerization.svg|upright=2.5|frameless|The distance change during polymerization.

Expanding monomers can not just be homopolymerized as it is shown here but also [[Copolymerization|copolymerized]] with other monomers to counteract their shrinking.\n\nUsually a Lewis acid like [[boron trifluoride etherate]] is used for both, the synthesis of the orthoester and the polymerization.

According to the \"Book of ceremonies\", the white tiger, phoenix, tortoise, and dragon are the four entities that possess spirit. Tortoise shells were [[Oracle bone|used for divination]] during the ancient Chinese [[Shang Dynasty]] and carry the [[Oracle bone script|earliest specimens]] of Chinese writing. Some Chinese are of the opinion that their script was taken from the signs on the back of the tortoise.\n\nFor the Chinese, the tortoise is sacred and symbolizes longevity, power, and tenacity. It is said that the tortoise helped [[Pangu]] (also known as P'an Ku) create the world: the creator goddess [[N\u00fcwa|Nuwa]] or Nugua cuts the legs off a sea turtle and uses them to prop up the sky after [[Gong Gong]] destroys the mountain that had supported the sky. The flat plastron and domed carapace of a turtle parallel the ancient Chinese idea of a flat earth and domed sky.<ref name=Allan>Allan, Sarah, 1991, ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0459-5}}.</ref> For the Chinese as well as the Indians, the tortoise symbolizes the universe.

The Chinese believe that tortoises come out in the spring when they change their shells, and hibernate during the winter, which is the reason for their long life.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe Chinese Imperial Army carried flags with images of dragons and tortoises as symbols of unparalleled power and inaccessibility, as these animals fought with each other but both remained alive. The dragon cannot break the tortoise and the latter cannot reach the dragon.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>  In China, the tortoise was also called the Black warrior, standing as a symbol of power, tenacity, and longevity, as well as that of north and winter. A tortoise was often put at the base of burial monuments. Legend holds that the wooden columns of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing were built on the shells of live tortoises since people thought that these animals were capable of living for more than 3000 years without food or water and are adorned with a magical power that prevents wood from rotting.\n\nIt was considered that the tortoise does not remember the day and month of its birth so calling someone a \"tortoise\" in China was considered offensive.\n\nIn Tibet, the tortoise is a symbol of creativity.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe tortoise is of the ''[[feng shui]]'' water element<ref name=Moran>Moran, Elizabeth, Biktashev, Val and Yu, Joseph, 2002, ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui'', Alpha Books, {{ISBN|0-02-864339-9}}.</ref> with the [[tiger]], [[fenghuang|phoenix]], and [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] representing the other three elements. According to the principles of ''feng shui'' the rear of the home is represented by the Black Tortoise, which signifies support for home, family life, and personal relationships. A tortoise at the back door of a house or in the backyard by a pond is said to attract good fortune and many blessings. Three tortoises stacked on top of each other represent a mother and her babies.<ref name=Moran/> In [[Taoism|Daoist]] art, the tortoise is an emblem of the triad of earth-humankind-heaven.<ref name=Tresidder>Tresidder, Jack, 2005, ''The Complete Dictionary of Symbols'', Chronicle Books, {{ISBN|0-8118-4767-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe tortoise is a symbol of longevity, with a potential lifespan of ten thousand years.<ref name=Ball/> Due to its longevity, a symbol of a turtle was often used during burials. A burial mound might be shaped like a turtle, and even called a \"grave turtle.\" A carved turtle, known as ''[[bixi (tortoise)|bixi]]'' was used as a plinth for memorial tablets of high-ranking officials during the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 CE) and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] periods (1368-1644 CE). Enormous turtles supported the memorial tablets of Chinese [[emperor of China|emperors]]<ref name=Simoons/> and support the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s [[stele]] near [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

The [[Sri Kurmam]] Temple in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, is dedicated to the Kurma avatar. Kurmavatara is also Kasyapa, the northern star, the first living being, forefather of Vishnu the protector. The plastron symbolizes the earthly world and the carapace the heavenly world. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] identifies the world as the body of Kurmaraja, the \"king of tortoises\", with the earth its plastron, the atmosphere its body, and the vault of the heavens its carapace. The tortoise holds the elephant, on which rests the earth. The elephant is the masculine symbol and the tortoise the feminine.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Edobambooscroll01.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese [[Edo period]] depiction of a minogame.]]\n\nJapanese culture adopted from China the myth of four Guardian Beasts, said in Japan to protect the city of Heian (Kyoto) from threats arising from each of the four cardinal directions.  The [[Black Tortoise]] or ''Gen-bu'', sometimes depicted as a combination of a tortoise and a snake, protects Kyoto from the north; the other beasts and associated directions are the [[Azure Dragon]] (''Sei-ryu'', east), the [[Vermilion Bird]] (''Su-zaku'', south), and the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]] (''Byak-ko'', west).\n\nIn [[Japan]], however, the turtle has developed a more independent tradition than the other three prominent beasts of China. The {{nihongo||\u84d1\u4e80|minogame}}, which is so old it has a train of seaweed growing on its back, is a symbol of longevity and felicity. A ''minogame'' has an important role in the well-known legend of ''[[Urashima Tar\u014d]]''.\n\nAccording to traditional Japanese beliefs, the tortoise is a haven for immortals and the world mountain, and symbolizes longevity, good luck, and support. It is the symbol of Kumpira, the god of seafaring people.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe tortoise is a favored motif by [[netsuke]]-carvers and other [[artisan]]s, and is featured in traditional Japanese wedding ceremonies.<ref name=Ball/> There is also a well-known artistic pattern based on the nearly hexagonal shape of a tortoise's shell. These patterns are usually composed of symmetrical hexagons, sometimes with smaller hexagons within them.<ref name=Niwa>Niwa, Motoji, 2001, trans, Thomas, Jay W., ''Snow, Wave, Pine: Traditional Patterns in Japanese Design'', {{ISBN|4-7700-2689-7}}.</ref>\n\n==== Vietnam ====\n[[File:EOS 6341 raw.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The stone turtle carries stela on its back [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu]] in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].]]\n\nMany legends of [[Vietnam]] connect closely to the turtle. During the time of [[Emperor Yao]] in China, a Vietnamese King's envoy offered a sacred turtle (Vietnamese: ''Th\u1ea7n Quy'') which was carved in ''Khoa \u0110\u1ea9u'' script on its carapace writing all things happening from the time Sky and Earth had been born. Yao King ordered a person to copy it and called it Turtle Calendar.\n\nAnother legend told that ''Kim Quy Deity'' (Golden Turtle Deity) came into sight and crawled after [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s pray. Following the Deity's foot prints, An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng built [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]] as a spiral. An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng was given a present of Kim Quy Deity's claw to make the trigger (Vietnamese: ''l\u1eaby''), one part of the [[crossbow]] (Vietnamese: n\u1ecf) named ''Linh Quang Kim Tr\u1ea3o Th\u1ea7n N\u1ecf'' that was the military secret of victorious [[Zhao Tuo]].\n\nA 15th-century legend tells that [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]] returned his sacred sword named ''[[Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (sword)|Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean]]'' (Heaven's Will) to [[Rafetus swinhoei|Golden Turtle]] in ''L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y'' lake after he had defeated the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] army. That is why ''L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y'' lake was renamed Sword Lake (Vietnamese: H\u1ed3 G\u01b0\u01a1m) or Returning Sword lake ([[Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake]]). This action symbolizes taking leave of weapons for peace.\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nIn Taiwanese villages, paste cakes of flour shaped like turtles are made for festivals that are held in honor of the lineage patron deity. People buy these cakes at their lineage temple and take them home to assure prosperity, harmony, and security for the following year.<ref name=Simoons/>\n\n=== North America ===\n\nThe [[World Turtle]] carries the Earth upon its back in myths from [[North America]]; for this reason many aboriginal North Americans refer to it as [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. In [[Cheyenne]] tradition, the great creator spirit Maheo kneads some mud he takes from a [[coot|coot's]] beak until it expands so much that only Old Grandmother Turtle can support it on her back. In [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] tradition, the trembling or shaking of the Earth is thought of as a sign that the World Turtle is stretching beneath the great weight that she carries.<ref name=Stookey/>\n\nNative Americans used combs made of tortoise shell to signify the margin between life and death. According to their beliefs, the cosmic tree emerges from the spine of the tortoise.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe expression \"[[turtles all the way down]]\" comes from the notion of the World Turtle.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Sea turtle Moche pottery Larco museum.jpg|thumbnail|Moche Sea Turtle. 200 A.D.

The exact passage from the [[Torah]] is:\n{{Quote|text=And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.|title=\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0, \u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05e2 (Leviticus 15:29-30)}}\n\nIn this case, however, the \"turtle\" referred to is a \"turtle-dove,\" a kosher bird, and not a reptile. Reptiles, according to Leviticus, are never kosher for eating or for sacrifice. Tortoises were regarded as unclean and often symbolized evil and darkness: \u201cThere also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind\u201d (Leviticus 11: 29)<ref name=\"BCG\">{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Richard|date=|title=TORTOISES AND THE EXOTIC ANIMAL TRADE IN BRITAIN FROM MEDIEVAL TO \u2018MODERN\u2019| url=http://www.britishcheloniagroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/u8/v8n1thomas_wm.pdf |journal=Testudo |volume=8|issue=1 |pages=56\u201368|via=British Chelonia Group Website}}</ref>\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe attitude that Judaism took towards Chelonians was inherited by the Christians.

One morning, Mrs. Silver mentions to Mr. Hoppy that even though she has had Alfie for many years, her pet has only grown a tiny bit and has gained only 3 ounces in weight. She confesses that she wishes she knew of some way to make her little Alfie grown into a larger, more dignified tortoise. Mr. Hoppy suddenly thinks of a way to give Mrs. Silver her wish and (he hopes) win her affection. He eventually begins swapping the tortoise for bigger and bigger ones, with the illusion of using magic.\n\nIn children's literature such as [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories|Yertle the Turtle]]'', the turtle is often depicted as a humorous character having a mixture of animal and human characteristics.<ref name=Marder>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith-Marder | first1 = Paula | year = 2006 | title = The Turtle and the Psyche | url = | journal = Journal of Psychological Perspectives | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 228\u2013248 | doi = 10.1080/00332920600998262 }}</ref><ref name=Goldstein>Goldstein, Jeffrey H., 1994, ''Toys, Play, and Child Development'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-45564-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:DuckandCover.jpg|thumb|Bert the turtle]]\n\n* The television show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' features a magical, ancient, island-sized creature called the \"Lion Turtle\".

First mentioned by Gibbs in [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|''The Curse of the Black Pearl'']] about how Sparrow managed to escape the island where Barbossa marooned him years ago. It is stated that two turtles were lashed together by Sparrow with human hair from his back to form a raft.

There are also various other Koopas in the game universe, such as the [[Koopalings]]. However, since Nintendo 64, many Koopas are friendly and very peaceful, living in villages like Koopa Village near Toad Town, the capital of Mushroom Kingdom. And one blue-shelled Koopa, Kooper, helps Super Mario in his Adventures against Bowser and his evil henchman.\n\n* The ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series has a few species resembling turtles or tortoises.

Turtles are also used as marketing tools to give products the appearance of being environmentally friendly.<ref name=Lutz/>\n\nOne of the most famous rescued sea turtles was \"Allie\", a 250&nbsp;lb (113&nbsp;kg), 50-year-old female [[loggerhead sea turtle]] rescued by a local commercial fisherman at [[Alligator Point, Florida]], on May 15, 2012.

In Praia do Forte, a marine conservation project called Tamar (from ''tartaruga marinha'' or sea turtle) receives more than 300,000 visitors every year, who are attracted by the idea of saving the habitat of five [[endangered sea turtles|endangered sea turtle]] species that nest on the coast. Tamar uses the sea turtle as a symbol for the need for the protection of the coastal environment.

From this combination turtles are often associated with [[cuckolds]] in China.  This folk identification may be reinforced by the old Chinese expression \"to wear a green hat\" ({{zh|s=\u6234\u7eff\u5e3d\u5b50|t=\u6234\u7da0\u5e3d\u5b50|p=d\u00e0i l\u01dcm\u00e0ozi}}) or \"to wear a green scarf\" ({{zh|s=\u6234\u7eff\u5934\u5dfe|t=\u6234\u7da0\u982d\u5dfe|p=d\u00e0i l\u01dct\u00f3uj\u012bn}}), which derives from sumptuary laws of the [[Spring-Autumn]] period (5th to 8th Century BCE) and means \"to be a cuckold.\"\n\nSecondly, \"sea turtle\" ({{zh|s=\u6d77\u9f9f|t=\u6d77\u9f9c|p=h\u01cei g\u016bi}}) is slang for a returnee, a Chinese person who has studied abroad and returned home. (There is also a [[pun]] here, as ''h\u01cei g\u016bi'' is also \u6d77\u5f52, \"to come back home from overseas\"). The term has positive connotations, implying a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean. By contrast, \"[[kelp]]\" ({{zh|p=h\u01cei d\u00e0i|s=\u6d77\u5e26|t=\u6d77\u5e36}}), is used to describe an unemployed returnee. It has negative overtones, implying the person is drifting aimlessly, and is also a homophonic expression ({{zh|p=h\u01ceid\u00e0i|c=\u6d77\u5f85}}, literally \"sea waiting\").\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Turtles in art}}\n*[[Owen and Mzee]], a real-life friendship between an old [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] and a baby [[hippopotamus]].\n*[[Mbeku]]\n*[[Turtle racing]]\n*[[Turtle soup]]\n*[[Zaratan]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070906001647/http://www.2xtreme.net/~nlinsley/ Sea Turtle Postage Stamps of the World.]\n* [http://hyakumonogatari.com/2011/09/01/the-appearance-of-the-spirit-turtle/ The Appearance of the Spirit Turtle] - An article about Japanese turtle folklore at hyakumonogatari.com\n* Kathleen Rodgers, ''Turtles in Literature'' (S&S Learning Materials, 1997).\n\n{{Turtles in human activities}}\n{{Living things in culture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cultural Depictions Of Turtles And Tortoises}}\n[[Category:Turtles in popular culture| ]]\n[[Category:Marine life in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Legendary reptiles]]\n[[Category:Legendary turtles| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eco shope thekkady.JPG|thumbnail|Eco shop]]\n[[File:El Gouna Turtle House R01.jpg|thumbnail|The Turtle House by the German architect and designer Kurt V\u00f6ltzke (Atelier Color, Chemnitz) at El Gouna (Red Sea, Egypt)]]\n'''[[Turtles]]''' are frequently depicted in popular culture as easygoing, patient, and wise creatures.

According to the \"Book of ceremonies\", the white tiger, phoenix, tortoise, and dragon are the four entities that possess spirit. Tortoise shells were [[Oracle bone|used for divination]] during the ancient Chinese [[Shang Dynasty]] and carry the [[Oracle bone script|earliest specimens]] of Chinese writing. Some Chinese are of the opinion that their script was taken from the signs on the back of the tortoise.\n\nFor the Chinese, the tortoise is sacred and symbolizes longevity, power, and tenacity. It is said that the tortoise helped [[Pangu]] (also known as P'an Ku) create the world: the creator goddess [[N\u00fcwa|Nuwa]] or Nugua cuts the legs off a sea turtle and uses them to prop up the sky after [[Gong Gong]] destroys the mountain that had supported the sky. The flat plastron and domed carapace of a turtle parallel the ancient Chinese idea of a flat earth and domed sky.<ref name=Allan>Allan, Sarah, 1991, ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0459-5}}.</ref> For the Chinese as well as the Indians, the tortoise symbolizes the universe.

The Chinese believe that tortoises come out in the spring when they change their shells, and hibernate during the winter, which is the reason for their long life.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe Chinese Imperial Army carried flags with images of dragons and tortoises as symbols of unparalleled power and inaccessibility, as these animals fought with each other but both remained alive. The dragon cannot break the tortoise and the latter cannot reach the dragon.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>  In China, the tortoise was also called the Black warrior, standing as a symbol of power, tenacity, and longevity, as well as that of north and winter. A tortoise was often put at the base of burial monuments. Legend holds that the wooden columns of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing were built on the shells of live tortoises since people thought that these animals were capable of living for more than 3000 years without food or water and are adorned with a magical power that prevents wood from rotting.\n\nIt was considered that the tortoise does not remember the day and month of its birth so calling someone a \"tortoise\" in China was considered offensive.\n\nIn Tibet, the tortoise is a symbol of creativity.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe tortoise is of the ''[[feng shui]]'' water element<ref name=Moran>Moran, Elizabeth, Biktashev, Val and Yu, Joseph, 2002, ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui'', Alpha Books, {{ISBN|0-02-864339-9}}.</ref> with the [[tiger]], [[fenghuang|phoenix]], and [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] representing the other three elements. According to the principles of ''feng shui'' the rear of the home is represented by the Black Tortoise, which signifies support for home, family life, and personal relationships. A tortoise at the back door of a house or in the backyard by a pond is said to attract good fortune and many blessings. Three tortoises stacked on top of each other represent a mother and her babies.<ref name=Moran/> In [[Taoism|Daoist]] art, the tortoise is an emblem of the triad of earth-humankind-heaven.<ref name=Tresidder>Tresidder, Jack, 2005, ''The Complete Dictionary of Symbols'', Chronicle Books, {{ISBN|0-8118-4767-5}}.</ref>\n\nThe tortoise is a symbol of longevity, with a potential lifespan of ten thousand years.<ref name=Ball/> Due to its longevity, a symbol of a turtle was often used during burials. A burial mound might be shaped like a turtle, and even called a \"grave turtle.\" A carved turtle, known as ''[[bixi (tortoise)|bixi]]'' was used as a plinth for memorial tablets of high-ranking officials during the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 CE) and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] periods (1368-1644 CE). Enormous turtles supported the memorial tablets of Chinese [[emperor of China|emperors]]<ref name=Simoons/> and support the [[Kangxi Emperor]]'s [[stele]] near [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. Tortoise shells were used for witchcraft and future forecasting.

The [[Sri Kurmam]] Temple in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India, is dedicated to the Kurma avatar. Kurmavatara is also Kasyapa, the northern star, the first living being, forefather of Vishnu the protector. The plastron symbolizes the earthly world and the carapace the heavenly world. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] identifies the world as the body of Kurmaraja, the \"king of tortoises\", with the earth its plastron, the atmosphere its body, and the vault of the heavens its carapace. The tortoise holds the elephant, on which rests the earth. The elephant is the masculine symbol and the tortoise the feminine.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\n==== Japan ====\n[[File:Edobambooscroll01.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese [[Edo period]] depiction of a minogame.]]\n\nJapanese culture adopted from China the myth of four Guardian Beasts, said in Japan to protect the city of Heian (Kyoto) from threats arising from each of the four cardinal directions.  The [[Black Tortoise]] or ''Gen-bu'', sometimes depicted as a combination of a tortoise and a snake, protects Kyoto from the north; the other beasts and associated directions are the [[Azure Dragon]] (''Sei-ryu'', east), the [[Vermilion Bird]] (''Su-zaku'', south), and the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]] (''Byak-ko'', west).\n\nIn [[Japan]], however, the turtle has developed a more independent tradition than the other three prominent beasts of China. The {{nihongo||\u84d1\u4e80|minogame}}, which is so old it has a train of seaweed growing on its back, is a symbol of longevity and felicity. A ''minogame'' has an important role in the well-known legend of ''[[Urashima Tar\u014d]]''.\n\nAccording to traditional Japanese beliefs, the tortoise is a haven for immortals and the world mountain, and symbolizes longevity, good luck, and support. It is the symbol of Kumpira, the god of seafaring people.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe tortoise is a favored motif by [[netsuke]]-carvers and other [[artisan]]s, and is featured in traditional Japanese wedding ceremonies.<ref name=Ball/> There is also a well-known artistic pattern based on the nearly hexagonal shape of a tortoise's shell. These patterns are usually composed of symmetrical hexagons, sometimes with smaller hexagons within them.<ref name=Niwa>Niwa, Motoji, 2001, trans, Thomas, Jay W., ''Snow, Wave, Pine: Traditional Patterns in Japanese Design'', {{ISBN|4-7700-2689-7}}.</ref>\n\n==== Vietnam ====\n[[File:EOS 6341 raw.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The stone turtle carries stela on its back [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu]] in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].]]\n\nMany legends of [[Vietnam]] connect closely to the turtle. During the time of [[Emperor Yao]] in China, a Vietnamese King's envoy offered a sacred turtle (Vietnamese: ''Th\u1ea7n Quy'') which was carved in ''Khoa \u0110\u1ea9u'' script on its carapace writing all things happening from the time Sky and Earth had been born. Yao King ordered a person to copy it and called it Turtle Calendar.\n\nAnother legend told that ''Kim Quy Deity'' (Golden Turtle Deity) came into sight and crawled after [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s pray. Following the Deity's foot prints, An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng built [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]] as a spiral. An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng was given a present of Kim Quy Deity's claw to make the trigger (Vietnamese: ''l\u1eaby''), one part of the [[crossbow]] (Vietnamese: n\u1ecf) named ''Linh Quang Kim Tr\u1ea3o Th\u1ea7n N\u1ecf'' that was the military secret of victorious [[Zhao Tuo]].\n\nA 15th-century legend tells that [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]] returned his sacred sword named ''[[Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (sword)|Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean]]'' (Heaven's Will) to [[Rafetus swinhoei|Golden Turtle]] in ''L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y'' lake after he had defeated the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] army. That is why ''L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y'' lake was renamed Sword Lake (Vietnamese: H\u1ed3 G\u01b0\u01a1m) or Returning Sword lake ([[Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake]]). This action symbolizes taking leave of weapons for peace.\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nIn Taiwanese villages, paste cakes of flour shaped like turtles are made for festivals that are held in honor of the lineage patron deity. People buy these cakes at their lineage temple and take them home to assure prosperity, harmony, and security for the following year.<ref name=Simoons/>\n\n=== North America ===\n\nThe [[World Turtle]] carries the Earth upon its back in myths from [[North America]]; for this reason many aboriginal North Americans refer to it as [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. In [[Cheyenne]] tradition, the great creator spirit Maheo kneads some mud he takes from a [[coot|coot's]] beak until it expands so much that only Old Grandmother Turtle can support it on her back. In [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] tradition, the trembling or shaking of the Earth is thought of as a sign that the World Turtle is stretching beneath the great weight that she carries.<ref name=Stookey/>\n\nNative Americans used combs made of tortoise shell to signify the margin between life and death. According to their beliefs, the cosmic tree emerges from the spine of the tortoise.<ref name=\"eedi.org.ua\"/>\n\nThe expression \"[[turtles all the way down]]\" comes from the notion of the World Turtle.\n\n=== South America ===\n[[File:Sea turtle Moche pottery Larco museum.jpg|thumbnail|Moche Sea Turtle. 200 A.D.

The exact passage from the [[Torah]] is:\n{{Quote|text=And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.|title=\u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0, \u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05e2 (Leviticus 15:29-30)}}\n\nIn this case, however, the \"turtle\" referred to is a \"turtle-dove,\" a kosher bird, and not a reptile. Reptiles, according to Leviticus, are never kosher for eating or for sacrifice. Tortoises were regarded as unclean and often symbolized evil and darkness: \u201cThere also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind\u201d (Leviticus 11: 29)<ref name=\"BCG\">{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Richard|date=|title=TORTOISES AND THE EXOTIC ANIMAL TRADE IN BRITAIN FROM MEDIEVAL TO \u2018MODERN\u2019| url=http://www.britishcheloniagroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/u8/v8n1thomas_wm.pdf |journal=Testudo |volume=8|issue=1 |pages=56\u201368|via=British Chelonia Group Website}}</ref>\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe attitude that Judaism took towards Chelonians was inherited by the Christians.

He eventually begins swapping the tortoise for bigger and bigger ones, with the illusion of using magic.\n\nIn children's literature such as [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories|Yertle the Turtle]]'', the turtle is often depicted as a humorous character having a mixture of animal and human characteristics.<ref name=Marder>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith-Marder | first1 = Paula | year = 2006 | title = The Turtle and the Psyche | url = | journal = Journal of Psychological Perspectives | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 228\u2013248 | doi = 10.1080/00332920600998262 }}</ref><ref name=Goldstein>Goldstein, Jeffrey H., 1994, ''Toys, Play, and Child Development'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-45564-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:DuckandCover.jpg|thumb|Bert the turtle]]\n\n* The television show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' features a magical, ancient, island-sized creature called the \"Lion Turtle\". The show also features \"turtle ducks\" that are kept in the palatial gardens of the [[Fire Nation]].\n* ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' was a six-minute [[civil defense]] film that starred an animated character called Bert the Turtle.\n* [[Gamera]], a Japanese movie monster, is the star of eleven films from 1965 to 2006.\n* ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', an animated movie, has a turtle spiritual master - [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Grand Master Oogway|Oogway]].\n* The character Rainbow Dash in the show, ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]'', has a pet tortoise named Tank.\n* The TV British sitcom ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' features a tortoise at the start and end of each episode.\n* The British speculative fiction documentary series, ''[[The Future is Wild]]'' shows a giant descendant of tortoises called the Toraton.\n* The ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' are [[comic book]] characters whose adventures have been adapted for TV and film. The main characters, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]], [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]], and [[Michelangelo (TMNT)|Michelangelo]], were named after the four renaissance artists.

If not, methinks this line should be changed. --> and ending up in the sewer system \u2013 echoed contemporary urban legends of small reptiles that were flushed down toilets growing into fierce animals in city sewers.<ref name=Jones/>\n*Sea Turtles are referred to multiple times in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films]]. First mentioned by Gibbs in [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|''The Curse of the Black Pearl'']] about how Sparrow managed to escape the island where Barbossa marooned him years ago. It is stated that two turtles were lashed together by Sparrow with human hair from his back to form a raft. This same trait was apparently used by Will in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|second film]] and the Prison Dog in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|third one]].\n*In the film ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Marlin (a [[Clownfish]]) and Dory (a [[Paracanthurus|Regal Blue Tang]]) are rescued  by a school of sea turtles led by surfer-dude [[Finding Nemo Characters|Crush]]. They reappear in the [[Finding Dory|sequel]].\n* A trio of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons depicts [[Bugs Bunny]] racing the slow-moving [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters#Cecil|Cecil Turtle]] in a contemporary version of one of [[Aesop]]'s fables.  The cartoons are ''[[Tortoise Beats Hare]]'', ''[[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]]'' and ''[[Rabbit Transit (film)|Rabbit Transit]]''.  Because of this trio, Cecil is the only character in the Looney Tunes series who consistently gets the better of Bugs.<ref name=Lenburg>Lenburg, Jeff, 2006, ''Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film & Television'', Hal Leonard, {{ISBN|1-55783-671-X}}.</ref>\n* For the [[Hammer Films]] production of ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'', [[Ray Harryhausen]] created and animated a giant version of the prehistoric turtle [[Archelon]], which attacked a group of cavemen.\n*A running gag in [[Tomska]]'s ''asdfmovie'' web series is a character stepping on a turtle with a button on its back. The turtle then explodes. This turtle has become known as Mine Turtle.\n*''[[The Red Turtle]]'' is a 2016 anime film about a giant red [[sea turtle]] that hinders a man's escape attempts from a desolate island.\n\n===Video games===\n\n* [[Koopa Troopa]]s (Japanese: \u30ce\u30b3\u30ce\u30b3 ''Nokonoko'') are common enemies in the ''[[Super Mario (series)|Mario]]'' series which resemble tortoises, usually displayed as henchmen under the direct leadership of [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who is also a Koopa. There are also various other Koopas in the game universe, such as the [[Koopalings]]. However, since Nintendo 64, many Koopas are friendly and very peaceful, living in villages like Koopa Village near Toad Town, the capital of Mushroom Kingdom. And one blue-shelled Koopa, Kooper, helps Super Mario in his Adventures against Bowser and his evil henchman.\n\n* The ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series has a few species resembling turtles or tortoises. [[Squirtle]], [[Wartortle]], and [[Blastoise]] are the water-type 'starter' Pok\u00e9mon in the [[Kanto Region]]. [[Turtwig]], [[Grotle]], and [[Torterra]] are likewise the grass-type starter Pok\u00e9mon of the [[Sinnoh Region]]. [[List of generation II Pok\u00e9mon#Shuckle|Shuckle]], in the [[Johto Region]], can often be mistaken for a stylised turtle, but is in fact a [[Mould]] Pok\u00e9mon. [[Tirtouga]] and [[Carracosta]] are can be revived from [[Fossils]] in the [[Unova Region]]. Blastoise, the final evolved form of Squirtle, is the mascot of the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'' video game.\n\n==In sports==\nThe athletic teams of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] are known as the [[Maryland Terrapins]] (often shortened to \"Terps\") and compete at the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States. The school [[College mascot|mascot]] is an anthropomorphic [[diamondback terrapin]] named \"Testudo\" (named after [[Testudo (turtle)|the Latin name for tortoises]]).\n\n==Political use==\n[[File:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|300px|A turtle in an American political cartoon poking fun at the [[Embargo Act of 1807]].]]\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups use the term \"[[Turtle Island (North America)|Great Turtle Island]]\" as an alternate term for [[Americas|America]], use of the term implying that the continent in question belongs to its indigenous inhabitants and that its conquest and settlement by Europeans was illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertasource.ca/natureslaws/culture/constitutional_turtle_island.html|title=Nature's Law - Culture - Great Turtle Island|author=|date=|website=www.albertasource.ca|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA [[post turtle]] is a reference to a politician who is being manipulated or controlled.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==In coins==\n<gallery>\nFile:Silver stater obverse Aigina Met L.1999.19.26.jpg|Silver stater obverse Aigina\nImage:BMC 193.jpg|Greek [[drachma]] of Aegina.

Tourists interact with turtles in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Greece, and the United States. Turtle-based [[ecotourism]] activities take place on nesting beaches around the world.<ref name=Lutz/> Sea turtles are on [[Tuvalu]] postage stamps as a national symbol.<ref name=Lutz/> The mascot of the [[KAME project]] is a sea turtle.\n\nDue to the turtle's status as a charismatic megafauna, it is a flagship animal for conservation efforts. Educating the public about turtles and conserving their habitats can positively affect other species living in the same habitats as turtles. Turtles are also used as marketing tools to give products the appearance of being environmentally friendly.<ref name=Lutz/>\n\nOne of the most famous rescued sea turtles was \"Allie\", a 250&nbsp;lb (113&nbsp;kg), 50-year-old female [[loggerhead sea turtle]] rescued by a local commercial fisherman at [[Alligator Point, Florida]], on May 15, 2012. Allie required 14 months of care at [[Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory]] before she was returned to the wild on June 22, 2013.

In Praia do Forte, a marine conservation project called Tamar (from ''tartaruga marinha'' or sea turtle) receives more than 300,000 visitors every year, who are attracted by the idea of saving the habitat of five [[endangered sea turtles|endangered sea turtle]] species that nest on the coast. Tamar uses the sea turtle as a symbol for the need for the protection of the coastal environment. Turtle-related souvenirs are sold to tourists, and hotels are \"turtle-friendly\": low-rise, dimly lit, and located away from the beach.<ref name=Levine>Levine, Robert M., 1999, ''The History of Brazil'', Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-313-30390-8}}.</ref>\n\nAt the [[World Trade Organization]]'s 1999 meeting in [[Seattle]], sea turtles were a focal point of [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|protests]].<ref name=Lutz/> A group of protesters from the [[Earth Island Institute]] that focused on the issue of [[Turtle excluder device|TED]] use in [[shrimp]] [[trawling|trawls]] wore sea turtle costumes.

From this combination turtles are often associated with [[cuckolds]] in China.  This folk identification may be reinforced by the old Chinese expression \"to wear a green hat\" ({{zh|s=\u6234\u7eff\u5e3d\u5b50|t=\u6234\u7da0\u5e3d\u5b50|p=d\u00e0i l\u01dcm\u00e0ozi}}) or \"to wear a green scarf\" ({{zh|s=\u6234\u7eff\u5934\u5dfe|t=\u6234\u7da0\u982d\u5dfe|p=d\u00e0i l\u01dct\u00f3uj\u012bn}}), which derives from sumptuary laws of the [[Spring-Autumn]] period (5th to 8th Century BCE) and means \"to be a cuckold.\"\n\nSecondly, \"sea turtle\" ({{zh|s=\u6d77\u9f9f|t=\u6d77\u9f9c|p=h\u01cei g\u016bi}}) is slang for a returnee, a Chinese person who has studied abroad and returned home. (There is also a [[pun]] here, as ''h\u01cei g\u016bi'' is also \u6d77\u5f52, \"to come back home from overseas\"). The term has positive connotations, implying a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean. By contrast, \"[[kelp]]\" ({{zh|p=h\u01cei d\u00e0i|s=\u6d77\u5e26|t=\u6d77\u5e36}}), is used to describe an unemployed returnee. It has negative overtones, implying the person is drifting aimlessly, and is also a homophonic expression ({{zh|p=h\u01ceid\u00e0i|c=\u6d77\u5f85}}, literally \"sea waiting\").\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Turtles in art}}\n*[[Owen and Mzee]], a real-life friendship between an old [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] and a baby [[hippopotamus]].\n*[[Mbeku]]\n*[[Turtle racing]]\n*[[Turtle soup]]\n*[[Zaratan]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070906001647/http://www.2xtreme.net/~nlinsley/ Sea Turtle Postage Stamps of the World.]\n* [http://hyakumonogatari.com/2011/09/01/the-appearance-of-the-spirit-turtle/ The Appearance of the Spirit Turtle] - An article about Japanese turtle folklore at hyakumonogatari.com\n* Kathleen Rodgers, ''Turtles in Literature'' (S&S Learning Materials, 1997).\n\n{{Turtles in human activities}}\n{{Living things in culture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cultural Depictions Of Turtles And Tortoises}}\n[[Category:Turtles in popular culture| ]]\n[[Category:Marine life in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Legendary reptiles]]\n[[Category:Legendary turtles| ]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(help needed) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_turtles"}

U.S. [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters southwest of [[Banja Luka|Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] successfully engaged and destroyed several Bosnian Serb warplanes which had attacked a Bosnian factory, while suffering no casualties of their own.

On 28 February, a flight of two 526th F-16s, \"Knight 25\" and \"Knight 26\", were crossing over Croatian airspace to conduct Close Air Support training near Sarajevo, Bosnia, when they detected six unidentified radar contacts eastbound in the No Fly Zone.  These contacts were not immediately visible to the NATO [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft flying over [[Hungary|Hungarian]] territory because of distance and hilly terrain.  After several minutes, AWACS was able to establish contact south of Banja Luka at 6:35&nbsp;a.m. Two other 526th Squadron F-16s, ''Black 03'' and ''Black 04'', were vectored to the area and intercepted six J-21 Jastreb and two [[J-22 Orao]] aircraft that were bombing the \"Bratstvo\" military factory at [[Novi Travnik]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Almanac of American Military History, Volume 1|last = Tucker|first = Spencer|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2012|isbn = 1-59884-530-6|location = |pages = 2180}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the [[UN]] and NATO [[rules of engagement]], orders to ''\"land or exit the [[no-fly zone]] or be engaged\"'' were issued twice, but both warnings were ignored. While warnings were issued, the violating aircraft dropped bombs over their target, which was left in flames. In such circumstances NATO has a \"single key\", meaning that only one clearance was needed, so the [[Combined Air Operations Center]] was immediately able to clear the F-16s to attack.\n\n== Air engagement ==\nThe Bosnian Serb Jastrebs headed northwards, back to their base. At 6:45&nbsp;a.m., the NATO fighters engaged their opponents. Captain Robert G. Wright fired an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], downing the first Jastreb which was flying at 5,000 feet. The remaining Jastrebs dropped to a few hundred feet, flying at low level to use the mountainous terrain to hide from [[radar]] and make their escape back to [[Udbina]]. Wright pressed on, closing to within [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] range. He engaged two aircraft with [[heat-seeking]] Sidewinder missiles, shooting them both down.\n\nAfter he had expended all his missiles and low on fuel, Wright handed over the chase to his wingman, [[Scott O'Grady|Capt. Scott O'Grady]], who had been flying 'top cover' above his flight leader. O'Grady dropped down to engage and fired an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder#AIM-9M|AIM-9M]]; the missile locked on and the proximity fuse of the warhead severely damaged the tail of the targeted Jastreb. ''Black flight'' was now approaching ''\"bingo fuel\",'' the point at which a plane will not have enough fuel to return, so they pulled off to [[Aerial refueling|refuel]] from a [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] circling in orbit over the [[Adriatic]].\n\nAt the same time the other pair of F-16Cs, ''\"Knight 25\"'' and ''\"Knight 26\"'',<ref>Call sign of the aircraft</ref> had been vectored to the area by the [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]]. At 6:50&nbsp;a.m., ''\"Knight 25\"'', piloted by Capt. Steve \"Yogi\" Allen, managed to get in behind a single Jastreb flying at a very low altitude. He launched a Sidewinder, downing another J-21 Jastreb. Knight 25 flight turned back hard to the south, where Knight 26, Col. John \"Jace\" Meyer, established radar lock on another aircraft fleeing to the northwest. After a minute of pursuit, radar contact was lost and the flight broke off the attack. Low on fuel, Knight 25 and 26 returned to the tanker over the Adriatic.  After refueling, they resumed combat air patrol over Bosnia. One remaining Serb aircraft was able to land as it ran out of fuel at Udbina Air Base in the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Serbian Krajina]] in present-day [[Croatia]].\n\nThe USAF credited three kills to [[USAF#Grade Structure|Captain]] Robert Gordon \"Wilbur\" Wright,<ref>Capt.

U.S. [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters southwest of [[Banja Luka|Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] successfully engaged and destroyed several Bosnian Serb warplanes which had attacked a Bosnian factory, while suffering no casualties of their own. It marked the first active combat, air-to-air or otherwise, in NATO's history.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-nato-military-action</ref>\n\n== Bombing of Novi Travnik ==\nIn February 1994, the [[526th Fighter Squadron]], \"Black Knights\", based at [[Ramstein_Air_Base|Ramstein AB]], [[Germany]], was attached to the 401st Operations Group (Provisional) operating out of Aviano AB, Italy, as part of NATO's [[Operation Deny Flight]]. On 28 February, a flight of two 526th F-16s, \"Knight 25\" and \"Knight 26\", were crossing over Croatian airspace to conduct Close Air Support training near Sarajevo, Bosnia, when they detected six unidentified radar contacts eastbound in the No Fly Zone.  These contacts were not immediately visible to the NATO [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|AWACS]] aircraft flying over [[Hungary|Hungarian]] territory because of distance and hilly terrain.  After several minutes, AWACS was able to establish contact south of Banja Luka at 6:35&nbsp;a.m. Two other 526th Squadron F-16s, ''Black 03'' and ''Black 04'', were vectored to the area and intercepted six J-21 Jastreb and two [[J-22 Orao]] aircraft which were bombing the \"Bratstvo\" military factory at [[Novi Travnik]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Almanac of American Military History, Volume 1|last = Tucker|first = Spencer|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2012|isbn = 1-59884-530-6|location = |pages = 2180}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the [[UN]] and NATO [[rules of engagement]], orders to ''\"land or exit the [[no-fly zone]] or be engaged\"'' were issued twice, but both warnings were ignored. While warnings were issued, the violating aircraft dropped bombs over their target, which was left in flames. In such circumstances NATO has a \"single key\", meaning that only one clearance was needed, so the [[Combined Air Operations Center]] was immediately able to clear the F-16s to attack.\n\n== Air engagement ==\nThe Bosnian Serb Jastrebs headed northwards, back to their base. At 6:45&nbsp;a.m., the NATO fighters engaged their opponents. Captain Robert G. Wright fired an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], downing the first Jastreb which was flying at 5,000 feet. The remaining Jastrebs dropped to a few hundred feet, flying at low level to use the mountainous terrain to hide from [[radar]] and make their escape back to [[Udbina]]. Wright pressed on, closing to within [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] range. He engaged two aircraft with [[heat-seeking]] Sidewinder missiles, shooting them both down.\n\nAfter he had expended all his missiles and low on fuel, Wright handed over the chase to his wingman, [[Scott O'Grady|Capt. Scott O'Grady]], who had been flying 'top cover' above his flight leader. O'Grady dropped down to engage and fired an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder#AIM-9M|AIM-9M]]; the missile locked on and the proximity fuse of the warhead severely damaged the tail of the targeted Jastreb. ''Black flight'' was now approaching ''\"bingo fuel\",'' the point at which a plane will not have enough fuel to return, so they pulled off to [[Aerial refueling|refuel]] from a [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] circling in orbit over the [[Adriatic]].\n\nAt the same time the other pair of F-16Cs, ''\"Knight 25\"'' and ''\"Knight 26\"'',<ref>Call sign of the aircraft</ref> had been vectored to the area by the [[E-3 Sentry|AWACS]]. At 6:50&nbsp;a.m., ''\"Knight 25\"'', piloted by Capt. Steve \"Yogi\" Allen, managed to get in behind a single Jastreb flying at a very low altitude. He launched a Sidewinder, downing another J-21 Jastreb. Knight 25 flight turned back hard to the south, where Knight 26, Col. John \"Jace\" Meyer, established radar lock on another aircraft fleeing to the northwest. After a minute of pursuit, radar contact was lost and the flight broke off the attack. Low on fuel, Knight 25 and 26 returned to the tanker over the Adriatic.  After refueling, they resumed combat air patrol over Bosnia. One remaining Serb aircraft was able to land as it ran out of fuel at Udbina Air Base in the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Serbian Krajina]] in present-day [[Croatia]].\n\nThe USAF credited three kills to [[USAF#Grade Structure|Captain]] Robert Gordon \"Wilbur\" Wright,<ref>Capt.

{"title_page": "Frizzle Sizzle", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2008}}\n'''Frizzle Sizzle''' were a Dutch teenage [[girl group]] of the 1980s. The four members of the group were Karin Vlasblom (born August 10, 1967), Laura Vlasblom (born October 8, 1968), [[Mandy Huydts]] (born April 9, 1969) and Marjon Keller (born June 1, 1970).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years: Kinderen voor Kinderen===\nThe girls debuted in 1981 on the second album of [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]], a children's choir whose ongoing television-shows are broadcast by [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] each November. All four of them were given a lead vocal; Karin in ''Gastarbeider'' (a song about a forbidden love between a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] girl and a [[Greeks|Greek]] boy), Mandy in ''Bijna brugklas'' (about the transition from primary to secondary school) and Marjon in ''Roken'', an anti-smoking tirade. Laura sang ''Verlegenheid'' (a reminder that shyness hits everyone at one moment) in an [[embryo]]nic line-up of Frizzle Sizzle (minus Marjon). Due to their age (14 was the maximum), the Vlasblom sisters left after the second album; Mandy and Marjon paid further contributions to the third album. The former sang ''Ik ben verliefd'' (about being in love), the latter ''Op de wip'' (about being stuck in the middle between a pain-in-the-neck brother and a bossy sister). Marjon left after the fourth album on which she had minor roles in two tracks; ''Iedereen gaat voor z'n beurt'' (''Nobody waits his turn'') and '''Ziek zijn'' (which sums up the joys of pretending to be sick to miss a day of school). She also sang the first half of the call-for-exercise ''Trim trim trim''.\n\n===Breaking out and breaking through===\nIn 1984 the girls appeared on the fifth show to tell that they formed a [[girl group]] and sang about their days with the choir as a bridge between the interviews with the departures and the new batch of songs. Marjon contributed to the volumes 5 and 6 as a backing vocalist.\n\nNaming themselves Frizzle Sizzle they were selected to represent the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986]] with ''Alles heeft een ritme'' (''Everything has rhythm''), a tropical-tinged song in the classic [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]]-[[mould]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.  At the end of the night, they ranked 13th out of 20, receiving 40 points. In the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] charts, the song went to No. 21.\n\nSoon afterwards Frizzle Sizzle released songs in English (''Never Give Up'' being the first). In early 1987 they had a No. 14 hit with ''Talk it Over'', which drew comparisons with established [[girl group]] [[Dolly Dots]]. ''Second Chance''  reached No. 38 the same year. Frizzle Sizzle were joint winners of the [[1987 Silver Harp Awards]] for new bands with their first and only album ''First Date''.\n\nIn 1988 the girls once again paid tribute to their past by singing a song about their first bicycle-ride (backed by an on-location video) for the Peter Faber-host educational series ''Mijn Eerste Keer'' (''My First Time'').\n\n===Solo activities===\nIn 1990 they broke up but not before lending their voices to the [[Herman van Veen]]-created cartoon series [[Alfred J Kwak]] and releasing the World Cup-themed ''Alles Is Oranje'' (''Everything Is Orange''). The girls remained active in showbusiness.\n\n*Karin made television programmes.\n[[File:Laura Vlasblom 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Laura Vlasblom performing in 1999.]]\n*Laura pursued a solo career and lived with [[boyband]] singer-turned-musical actor [[Bastiaan Ragas]]. (She also does Dutch voice-overs & songs for many characters in animated movies. For example, she voiced Gloria in Madagascar, Prinses Jasmine in Aladdin, Thumbelina in [[Thumbelina]] (1994), Robyn Starling in [[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]] & Ariel in The Little Mermaid). In 1992 Laura participated in the Dutch heat of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song ''Gouden Bergen'' (''Gold Mountains''); she had to settle for silver as it reached the second spot. In 1999 Laura appeared on RTL's live-music programme ''De Vrienden van Amstel''; she performed three songs (two covers, one original) backed by Dutch-Moluccan percussion-rockers [[Massada (band)|Massada]].\n*Mandy Huydts became a backing vocalist for arena-filling megastar [[Rene Froger]] but released her own material in between commitments.\n*Marjon Keller, now hosting radio-shows as well as doing voice-overs for [[RTL 4|RTL]], always insisted on not being lived by [[stardom]]. Back in 1988 she was quoted \"It (was) fun being part of Frizzle Sizzle, but there are more things in life\".\n\nIn 1995 former members of [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]] were invited to attend the 15th show (hosted by [[Paul de Leeuw]]).

The four members of the group were Karin Vlasblom (born August 10, 1967), Laura Vlasblom (born October 8, 1968), [[Mandy Huydts]] (born April 9, 1969) and Marjon Keller (born June 1, 1970).\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years: Kinderen voor Kinderen===\nThe girls debuted in 1981 on the second album of [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]], a children's choir whose ongoing television-shows are broadcast by [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]] each November. All four of them were given a lead vocal; Karin in ''Gastarbeider'' (a song about a forbidden love between a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] girl and a [[Greeks|Greek]] boy), Mandy in ''Bijna brugklas'' (about the transition from primary to secondary school) and Marjon in ''Roken'', an anti-smoking tirade. Laura sang ''Verlegenheid'' (a reminder that shyness hits everyone at one moment) in an [[embryo]]nic line-up of Frizzle Sizzle (minus Marjon). Due to their age (14 was the maximum), the Vlasblom sisters left after the second album; Mandy and Marjon paid further contributions to the third album. The former sang ''Ik ben verliefd'' (about being in love), the latter ''Op de wip'' (about being stuck in the middle between a pain-in-the-neck brother and a bossy sister). Marjon left after the fourth album on which she had minor roles in two tracks; ''Iedereen gaat voor z'n beurt'' (''Nobody waits his turn'') and '''Ziek zijn'' (which sums up the joys of pretending to be sick to miss a day of school). She also sang the first half of the call-for-exercise ''Trim trim trim''.\n\n===Breaking out and breaking through===\nIn 1984 the girls appeared on the fifth show to tell that they formed a [[girl group]] and sang about their days with the choir as a bridge between the interviews with the departures and the new batch of songs. Marjon contributed to the volumes 5 and 6 as a backing vocalist.\n\nNaming themselves Frizzle Sizzle they were selected to represent the [[Netherlands]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986]] with ''Alles heeft een ritme'' (''Everything has rhythm''), a tropical-tinged song in the classic [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]]-[[mould]].  At the end of the night, they ranked 13th out of 20, receiving 40 points. In the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] charts, the song went to No. 21.\n\nSoon afterwards Frizzle Sizzle released songs in English (''Never Give Up'' being the first). In early 1987 they had a No. 14 hit with ''Talk it Over'', which drew comparisons with established [[girl group]] [[Dolly Dots]]. ''Second Chance''  reached No. 38 the same year. Frizzle Sizzle were joint winners of the [[1987 Silver Harp Awards]] for new bands with their first and only album ''First Date''.\n\nIn 1988 the girls once again paid tribute to their past by singing a song about their first bicycle-ride (backed by an on-location video) for the Peter Faber-host educational series ''Mijn Eerste Keer'' (''My First Time'').\n\n===Solo activities===\nIn 1990 they broke up but not before lending their voices to the [[Herman van Veen]]-created cartoon series [[Alfred J Kwak]] and releasing the World Cup-themed ''Alles Is Oranje'' (''Everything Is Orange''). The girls remained active in showbusiness.\n\n*Karin made television programmes.\n[[File:Laura Vlasblom 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Laura Vlasblom performing in 1999.]]\n*Laura pursued a solo career and lived with [[boyband]] singer-turned-musical actor [[Bastiaan Ragas]]. (She also does Dutch voice-overs & songs for many characters in animated movies. For example, she voiced Gloria in Madagascar, Prinses Jasmine in Aladdin, Thumbelina in [[Thumbelina]] (1994), Robyn Starling in [[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]] & Ariel in The Little Mermaid). In 1992 Laura participated in the Dutch heat of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song ''Gouden Bergen'' (''Gold Mountains''); she had to settle for silver as it reached the second spot. In 1999 Laura appeared on RTL's live-music programme ''De Vrienden van Amstel''; she performed three songs (two covers, one original) backed by Dutch-Moluccan percussion-rockers [[Massada (band)|Massada]].\n*Mandy Huydts became a backing vocalist for arena-filling megastar [[Rene Froger]] but released her own material in between commitments.\n*Marjon Keller, now hosting radio-shows as well as doing voice-overs for [[RTL 4|RTL]], always insisted on not being lived by [[stardom]]. Back in 1988 she was quoted \"It (was) fun being part of Frizzle Sizzle, but there are more things in life\".\n\nIn 1995 former members of [[Kinderen voor Kinderen]] were invited to attend the 15th show (hosted by [[Paul de Leeuw]]). The ex-Frizzle Sizzles were notably absent, but they later compensated by making an in-crowd appearance at [[Paul de Leeuw|De Leeuw]]'s own TV-show. \"Still [[barefoot]] ?\" he asked, referring to their 1986-image.
