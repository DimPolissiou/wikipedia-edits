He leads many protests against various injustices happening around his village. Most of the time, he is seen as a joker. He and his small team of like-minded individuals sue on behalf of the villagers. One of Mannan's cases is against the local [[Sand mining in Tamil Nadu|illegal sand mining]] group whose lorry maimed a goat. Another case is against a local school owner on whose property a toddler fell down an open deep [[bore well]], resulting in brain damage. When this case was dismissed, Mannan stabs the school owner and is arrested. His past is told through the report submitted on the judge's order.\n\nMannan falls in loves with Malliga, who is from the neighbouring village. Malliga proclaims that she will marry him only if he builds a toilet at his home. He applies for [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan|a government scheme]] that provides incentive for building a toilet, along with his neighbours, but is cheated out of the government grant and is handed over just the basin. When the President of India announces a visit to the village to formally open the first toilet built under this scheme, Mannan's house is chosen. This prompts the village councilor to complete the unfinished toilet. It is still unfinished when the security team refuses clearance and another villager's toilet is chosen instead. Mallika yearns to use the toilet. When she does use it during a storm, the unfinished walls collapse on her and is discovered the next day by Mannan, the day of the President's visit. The police and the politicians lock him up in his house when he demands an ambulance. It was too late when Malliga is finally taken to the hospital. She goes into a vegetative state, and the [[fetus|foetus]] was lost. He petitions all the way to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] to grant [[Euthanasia in India|euthanasia]] to his wife. Mannan loses his mind while he waits for a verdict. He takes up various causes and is beaten in the police station every time.\n\nMannan gets out on bail to go to the final hearing in the Supreme Court. The justices deny the euthanasia petition and order a mental evaluation of Mannan. Mannan walks out of the hospital and [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] his way back to his village. He is hit by a lorry of the sand miners. He is identified in the [[mortuary]] by his associates. Mannan's sister blames his associates for his death. In the end, the associates take care of Mannan's wife, while also reporting his death as a murder.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Guru Somasundaram]] as Mannar Mannan\n*Ramya Pandiyan as Malliga\n*Gayathri Krishnaa as Isai\n*[[Mu Ramaswamy]] as 'Potti Case' Ponnoonjal\n*Bava Chelladurai\n*P.V.Anandakrishnan as S.P\n\n==Production==\nSomasundaram says, 'Working with Raju Murugan was very good and organic. Organic means, the procedures involved in film making, which included exhaustive script discussions. In the pre-production stage itself, we decided on everything, from the look of a character to the manner of dialogue delivery to the costumes to everything.

Quite an unusual kickstart, this one is set to tune and percussion as a period set song. Sounding typically like a song straight out of [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman]] print rich black and white, the song questions a prospective leader who campaigns to vote for him, on what his plans are, for the next five years. Sung in the rustic voices of Arandhai Bava and K Perumal, titch for the context, Yugabharathi's lyrics are subtle yet strong. Close on the heels of elections in the state, although coming across as a lighthearted thread of questions, the song carries a palpably heavy and looming question, in strong and smart choice of words.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nThe second single track \"Chellamma\" was directly launched at the [[Suryan FM 93.5]] [[Radio broadcasting|Radio Station]], [[Chennai]] on 1 June 2016, featuring Sean Roldan and [[Raju Murugan]] in a morning show. This song is sans beats, and relies on a sinewy orchestra for the background support. The song opens with Hindi lyrics, before opening out as a loving call in Lalitha's voice. The song is the rendition of an affectionate solo, for a bosom one, caring dearly in each phrase. Words for this one have been cherry picked by Ramesh Vaidya, that speak of the speciality in the relationship, relating it to beautiful aspects of nature in parts, and reminiscing in poetic memories in parts. In all, this call of love is tender yet loud and clear.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe complete soundtrack album was released, with a formal press meet held on 8 June 2016 at [[Prasad Studios|Prasad Labs]], [[Chennai]] with prominent directors [[Bala (director)|Bala]], [[Vetrimaaran]], music composer [[Santhosh Narayanan]] and other celebrities attended the event along with the film's cast and crew.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://view7media.com/joker-movie-audio-launch-press-meet-photos/|title=Joker Movie Audio Launch and Press Meet Photos|last=admin|date=2016-04-20|website=View7media - latest update about tamil cinema movie reviews|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> Within hours of its release, the album received positive reviews from critics.

He leads many protests against various injustices happening around his village. Most of the time, he is seen as a joker. He and his small team of like-minded individuals sue on behalf of the villagers. One of Mannan's cases is against the local [[Sand mining in Tamil Nadu|illegal sand mining]] group whose lorry maimed a goat. Another case is against a local school owner on whose property a toddler fell down an open deep [[bore well]], resulting in brain damage. When this case was dismissed, Mannan stabs the school owner and is arrested. His past is told through the report submitted on the judge's order.\n\nMannan falls in loves with Malliga, who is from the neighbouring village. Malliga proclaims that she will marry him only if he builds a toilet at his home. He applies for [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan|a government scheme]] that provides incentive for building a toilet, along with his neighbours, but is cheated out of the government grant and is handed over just the basin. When the President of India announces a visit to the village to formally open the first toilet built under this scheme, Mannan's house is chosen. This prompts the village councilor to complete the unfinished toilet. It is still unfinished when the security team refuses clearance and another villager's toilet is chosen instead. Mallika yearns to use the toilet. When she does use it during a storm, the unfinished walls collapse on her and is discovered the next day by Mannan, the day of the President's visit. The police and the politicians lock him up in his house when he demands an ambulance. It was too late when Malliga is finally taken to the hospital. She goes into a vegetative state, and the [[fetus|foetus]] was lost. He petitions all the way to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] to grant [[Euthanasia in India|euthanasia]] to his wife. Mannan loses his mind while he waits for a verdict. He takes up various causes and is beaten in the police station every time.\n\nMannan gets out on bail to go to the final hearing in the Supreme Court. The justices deny the euthanasia petition and order a mental evaluation of Mannan. Mannan walks out of the hospital and [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] his way back to his village. He is hit by a lorry of the sand miners. He is identified in the [[mortuary]] by his associates. Mannan's sister blames his associates for his death. In the end, the associates take care of Mannan's wife, while also reporting his death as a murder.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Guru Somasundaram]] as Mannar Mannan\n*Ramya Pandiyan as Malliga\n*Gayathri Krishnaa as Isai\n*[[Mu Ramaswamy]] as 'Potti Case' Ponnoonjal\n*Bava Chelladurai\n*P.V.Anandakrishnan as S.P\n\n==Production==\nSomasundaram says, 'Working with Raju Murugan was very good and organic. Organic means, the procedures involved in film making, which included exhaustive script discussions. In the pre-production stage itself, we decided on everything, from the look of a character to the manner of dialogue delivery to the costumes to everything.

Most of the singers are folks artist native to [[Dharmapuri]] where the movie was filmed. \n\nThe first single track \"Ennanga Sir Unga Sattam\" was released on 16 May 2016, which is a [[Satire|satirical]] song. A 20-second promo of the song was released, a day before the single release on 15 May 2016. The opening track of this album is a number on politics. Quite an unusual kickstart, this one is set to tune and percussion as a period set song. Sounding typically like a song straight out of [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman]] print rich black and white, the song questions a prospective leader who campaigns to vote for him, on what his plans are, for the next five years. Sung in the rustic voices of Arandhai Bava and K Perumal, titch for the context, Yugabharathi's lyrics are subtle yet strong. Close on the heels of elections in the state, although coming across as a lighthearted thread of questions, the song carries a palpably heavy and looming question, in strong and smart choice of words.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nThe second single track \"Chellamma\" was directly launched at the [[Suryan FM 93.5]] [[Radio broadcasting|Radio Station]], [[Chennai]] on 1 June 2016, featuring Sean Roldan and [[Raju Murugan]] in a morning show. This song is sans beats, and relies on a sinewy orchestra for the background support. The song opens with Hindi lyrics, before opening out as a loving call in Lalitha's voice. The song is the rendition of an affectionate solo, for a bosom one, caring dearly in each phrase. Words for this one have been cherry picked by Ramesh Vaidya, that speak of the speciality in the relationship, relating it to beautiful aspects of nature in parts, and reminiscing in poetic memories in parts. In all, this call of love is tender yet loud and clear.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe complete soundtrack album was released, with a formal press meet held on 8 June 2016 at [[Prasad Studios|Prasad Labs]], [[Chennai]] with prominent directors [[Bala (director)|Bala]], [[Vetrimaaran]], music composer [[Santhosh Narayanan]] and other celebrities attended the event along with the film's cast and crew.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://view7media.com/joker-movie-audio-launch-press-meet-photos/|title=Joker Movie Audio Launch and Press Meet Photos|last=admin|date=2016-04-20|website=View7media - latest update about tamil cinema movie reviews|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> Within hours of its release, the album received positive reviews from critics.

Television]] and [[Chuck Lorre Productions]]. ''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Later seasons saw a return to a lukewarm reception, with the show being criticized for a decline in comedic quality. Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings, ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] from 2011 to 2014 and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] four times for [[Jim Parsons]]. In total, it won seven Emmy Awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series]] in 2011. The series also spawned a prequel series in 2017 based on Parsons' character, Sheldon Cooper, named ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which also airs on CBS.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Production==\n{{anchor|OriginalPilot}}\n[[File:The Big Bang Theory Logo.png|thumb|Series' logo used for print]]\nThe show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007.

The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]) and Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]), who are named after [[Sheldon Leonard]], a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. A minor character, Althea ([[Vernee Watson]]), appeared in the first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php?p=187|title=CLP&nbsp;\u2013 Vanity Card #187|first=Chuck|last=Lorre|publisher=Chuck Lorre Productions|date=October 15, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The first pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, \"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior\" (played by Canadian actress [[Amanda Walsh]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=05/26/06&id=7165|title=Breaking News&nbsp;\u2013 Development Update: May 22\u201326 (Weekly Round-Up)|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2009/05/big-bang-theory-we-didnt-anticipate-how-protective-the-audience-would-feel-toward-our-guys.html|title='Big Bang Theory': 'We didn't anticipate how protective the audience would feel about our guys'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> and Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters (played by [[Iris Bahr]]). Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used [[Thomas Dolby]]'s hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" as its theme song.\n\nAlthough the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]). The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the evolution of the show, [[Chuck Lorre]] said, \"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \"Wow, that would be something.

Additionally, Howard can speak [[Sindarin]], one of the two [[Elvish languages|Elvish]] languages from ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nWednesday night is the group's designated \"comic book night\"<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Hofstadter Isotope|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep20|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=April 13, 2009|season=2|number=20|minutes=1:01}}</ref> because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released.

Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \"[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]\".\n\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \"[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \"[[The Beta Test Initiation]]\". After Penny suggests having sex in \"The Launch Acceleration\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \"no\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \"The Tangible Affection Proof\". In the sixth-season episode, \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\n\n===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard sign Sheldon up for online dating to find a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \"fascinating\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\". The same night he draws up \"The Relationship Agreement\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \"Roommate Agreement\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy tries to use her \"neurobiology bag of tricks\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. Her efforts appear to be working as Sheldon is not happy but makes no attempt to stop her. In the final fifth-season episode \"The Countdown Reflection\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \"The Date Night Variable\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \"it's a possibility\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \"The Love Spell Potential\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.<ref>The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, \"The Love Spell Potential.</ref>\n\n\"The Locomotive Manipulation\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, 45 days into the trip, Sheldon gets mugged and calls for Leonard to drive him home, only to be confronted by Amy, who is upset over not being contacted by him in weeks. When Sheldon admits he did not call her because he was too embarrassed to admit that he could not make it on his own; Amy accepts that he is not perfect. In \"The Prom Equivalency\", Sheldon hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\n\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. In season ten, Amy's apartment is flooded, and she and Sheldon decide to move in together into Penny's apartment as part of a five-week experiment to determine compatibility with each other's living habits. It goes well and they decide to make the arrangement permanent.\n\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh-season finale.\n\n===Soft Kitty===\n{{main|Soft Kitty}}\nIn the show, the song \"Soft Kitty\" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill. Its repeated use in the series popularized the song.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Seidman|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/16/cbs-com-launches-soft-kitty-contest-inspired-by-popular-song-from-cbs-hit-the-big-bang-theory/72269/ |title=CBS.com Launches \"Soft Kitty\" Contest Inspired by Popular Song From CBS Hit 'The Big Bang Theory' |work=TV by the Numbers |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> A scene depicting the origin of the song in Sheldon's childhood is depicted in an episode of ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which aired on February 1, 2018. It shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the [[influenza|flu]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tyler|title='Young Sheldon' reveals the origin story of the 'Soft Kitty' song|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=February 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202032842/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|archivedate=February 2, 2018|url-status=live|date=February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Howard's mother===\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by [[Carol Ann Susi]] until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Countdown Reflection|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep24|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24|minutes=19:54}}</ref> She reflects the [[Jewish mother stereotype]] in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \"grounds\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.<ref name=\"Episode4.16\">{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Formulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep16|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 17, 2011|season=4|number=16}}</ref> Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Maternal Capacitance|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep15|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 9, 2009|season=2|number=15}}</ref> and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Apology Insufficiency|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep7|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=November 4, 2010|season=4|number=7}}</ref> In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\n\n===Apartment building elevator===\nIn the apartment building where Sheldon, Leonard and Penny (and later Amy) live, the elevator has been out of order throughout most of the series, forcing characters to have to use the stairs. Stairway conversations between characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition between longer scenes. The Season 3 episode, \"The Staircase Implementation\" reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with rocket fuel.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Staircase Implementation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648756/|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref> In the penultimate episode of the series, the elevator is returned to an operational state, causing Sheldon some angst.\n\n===Vanity cards===\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ends by showing for one second a [[vanity card]] written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php|title=Chuck Lorre Productions \u2013 Vanity Cards|publisher=Chucklorre.com |date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}</ref> The series final vanity card reads simply \"The End\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php?p=622|title=CLP - Vanity Card #622|website=www.chucklorre.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nAlthough the initial reception was mixed,<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Big Bang Theory'': Season 1 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-big-bang-theory/s01/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}</ref> the show has since then received critical acclaim.

The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes|publisher=Barb.co.uk|date=July 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014705/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011.

Television]] and [[Chuck Lorre Productions]]. ''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Later seasons saw a return to a lukewarm reception, with the show being criticized for a decline in comedic quality. Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings, ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] from 2011 to 2014 and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] four times for [[Jim Parsons]]. In total, it won seven Emmy Awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series]] in 2011. The series also spawned a prequel series in 2017 based on Parsons' character, Sheldon Cooper, named ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which also airs on CBS.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Production==\n{{anchor|OriginalPilot}}\n[[File:The Big Bang Theory Logo.png|thumb|Series' logo used for print]]\nThe show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007.

The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]) and Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]), who are named after [[Sheldon Leonard]], a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. A minor character, Althea ([[Vernee Watson]]), appeared in the first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php?p=187|title=CLP&nbsp;\u2013 Vanity Card #187|first=Chuck|last=Lorre|publisher=Chuck Lorre Productions|date=October 15, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The first pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, \"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior\" (played by Canadian actress [[Amanda Walsh]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=05/26/06&id=7165|title=Breaking News&nbsp;\u2013 Development Update: May 22\u201326 (Weekly Round-Up)|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2009/05/big-bang-theory-we-didnt-anticipate-how-protective-the-audience-would-feel-toward-our-guys.html|title='Big Bang Theory': 'We didn't anticipate how protective the audience would feel about our guys'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> and Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters (played by [[Iris Bahr]]). Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence.

The original pilot used [[Thomas Dolby]]'s hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" as its theme song.\n\nAlthough the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]). The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the evolution of the show, [[Chuck Lorre]] said, \"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim.

Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \"[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]\".\n\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \"[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \"[[The Beta Test Initiation]]\". After Penny suggests having sex in \"The Launch Acceleration\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \"no\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \"The Tangible Affection Proof\". In the sixth-season episode, \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\n\n===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard sign Sheldon up for online dating to find a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \"fascinating\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\". The same night he draws up \"The Relationship Agreement\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \"Roommate Agreement\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy tries to use her \"neurobiology bag of tricks\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. Her efforts appear to be working as Sheldon is not happy but makes no attempt to stop her. In the final fifth-season episode \"The Countdown Reflection\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \"The Date Night Variable\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \"it's a possibility\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \"The Love Spell Potential\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.<ref>The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, \"The Love Spell Potential.</ref>\n\n\"The Locomotive Manipulation\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, 45 days into the trip, Sheldon gets mugged and calls for Leonard to drive him home, only to be confronted by Amy, who is upset over not being contacted by him in weeks. When Sheldon admits he did not call her because he was too embarrassed to admit that he could not make it on his own; Amy accepts that he is not perfect. In \"The Prom Equivalency\", Sheldon hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\n\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. In season ten, Amy's apartment is flooded, and she and Sheldon decide to move in together into Penny's apartment as part of a five-week experiment to determine compatibility with each other's living habits. It goes well and they decide to make the arrangement permanent.\n\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh-season finale.\n\n===Soft Kitty===\n{{main|Soft Kitty}}\nIn the show, the song \"Soft Kitty\" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill.

The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes|publisher=Barb.co.uk|date=July 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014705/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011.

He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]].

As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name=\"McGilligan, p. 108\" />\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name=\"McGilligan192\" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92. It had a profound impact on Eastwood's life; from then on he became more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency and with more speed and efficiency on set.<ref name=\"McGilligan193\" /> Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became more so after his father's death.
