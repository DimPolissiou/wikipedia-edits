The first was a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] derivative, with a [[Zefiro 23]] second stage, a [[Zefiro 9]] third stage and an AVUM upper stage. With the LFBB replacing the [[P80 (rocket stage)|P80 stage]], the payload to [[sun-synchronous orbit]] (SSO) would increase to {{convert|1882|kg|abbr = on}}, compared to the {{convert|1450|kg|abbr = on}} of the Vega. The second was an [[Ariane 4]] derivative called H-25<!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source-->. It was  based on an H10 upper stage with a [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci rocket engine]] and {{Convert|25|tonnes|ST}} of [[cryogenic fuel]]. Depending on the method of deceleration, the payload to SSO is between {{Convert|1481|and|2788|kg|abbr = on}}. The third was a large cryogenic upper stage, called H-185, based on an alternative, yet-to-be-developed Ariane 5 main stage with {{Convert|185|tonnes|ST}} of cryogenic fuel. Its payload to SSO is {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}}.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\"/>{{rp|216}}\n\nTwo of the lighter configurations (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted on top of the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above {{Convert|2|km/s|abbr = on}} to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using {{Convert|10|tonnes|ST}} of fuel and reduce the velocity by {{Convert|300|m/s|abbr = on}}. However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. Another option is to use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex. As a result, an alternative [[ballute]] was proposed. Flight dynamics simulation revealed that a ballute with a cross-section of {{Convert|45|m2|abbr = on}} offered the best compromise between loads on the booster and deceleration by aerodynamic forces. In this configuration, a launch performance of up to {{convert|2788|kg|abbr = on}} could be achieved, partly thanks to a higher separation velocity.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\" />{{rp|216}}\n\nThe heaviest configuration uses a single booster with an asymmetrically mounted, large, expendable cryogenic stage designated H-185<!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source-->. It was proposed as a future variant of the Ariane 5 core stage (H158), eventually meant to phase out the main stage in a standard launch configuration with LFBB. H-185 would use a new Vulcain&nbsp;3 main engine, with increased vacuum thrust. When launched with a single booster, both stages would be operated in parallel, and be delivered to a {{Convert|180 by 800|km|abbr = on}} orbit before separation. The remaining upper stage composite would weigh {{convert|7360|kg|abbr = on}}, with a {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}} payload performance to SSO.

The increased circumference of the main stage allows five LFBBs to be integrated with either retractable or [[variable geometry wing|variable-geometry wing]]s. The upper stage would be a derivative of the Ariane 5 ESC-B, with the size upped to {{convert|5.6 x 8.98|m|ft|abbr = on}}, and strengthened to bear higher loads. The [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci engine]] was proofed to be sufficiently powerful for [[orbital insertion]].

To avoid simultaneous separation of all boosters, either a cross-feed to the main stage, or [[Rocket engine throttling|throttling]] could be used.

For LEO missions, the launch vehicle would be {{convert|57.3|m|ft}} tall, with a gross lift-off mass of {{convert|739.4|tonnes|ST}}.

However, when other projects, such as [[Space Shuttle]] or [[VentureStar]], undertook this objective, they failed to meet their goals.

When launched with a single booster, both stages would be operated in parallel, and be delivered to a {{Convert|180 by 800|km|abbr = on}} orbit before separation. The remaining upper stage composite would weigh {{convert|7360|kg|abbr = on}}, with a {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}} payload performance to SSO.

This configuration was designed to provide increased capabilities for complex missions, including manned explorations to the [[Moon exploration|Moon]] and to [[Mars exploration|Mars]], as well as the launch of large solar-powered satellites.<ref name=\"Wiederverwendbare\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\nThe new core stage would stand {{convert|28.65|meters|abbr = on}} tall and have a diameter of {{convert|10|meters|abbr = on}}, feeding {{convert|600|tonnes|ST}} of [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH<sub>2</sub>]] to three Vulcain&nbsp;3 engines. The increased circumference of the main stage allows five LFBBs to be integrated with either retractable or [[variable geometry wing|variable-geometry wing]]s. The upper stage would be a derivative of the Ariane 5 ESC-B, with the size upped to {{convert|5.6 x 8.98|m|ft|abbr = on}}, and strengthened to bear higher loads. The [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci engine]] was proofed to be sufficiently powerful for [[orbital insertion]]. Payload would be enclosed in an {{convert|8 x 29.5|m|ft|abbr = on}} [[Payload fairing|fairing]]. The launch vehicle would have a total height of {{convert|69|meters|abbr = on}} and a [[Gross lift-off mass|mass]] of {{convert|1900|tonnes|ST}}.

To avoid simultaneous separation of all boosters, either a cross-feed to the main stage, or [[Rocket engine throttling|throttling]] could be used. The return flight of the boosters would require an estimated {{convert|3250|kg|abbr = on}} of fuel, including a 30% reserve.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\" />{{rp|218\u2013219}}\n\n===Two-stage-to-orbit===\n[[Image:LFBB TSTO.svg|thumb|Top view of the TSTO configuration with the LFBB shown in blue]]\n{{See also|Two-stage-to-orbit}}\nA reusable Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle was planned to be implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\" />{{rp|216}} However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\" />{{rp|219}}\n\nThe external tank, being a core of the system, would have a diameter of {{convert|5.4|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|30.5|m|ft}}, carrying {{convert|167.5|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The attached orbiter would be {{convert|28.8|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|3.6|m|ft}} in diameter, carrying {{convert|50|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The payload fairing mount atop the orbiter would be {{convert|5.4 x 20.5|m|ft}}. For LEO missions, the launch vehicle would be {{convert|57.3|m|ft}} tall, with a gross lift-off mass of {{convert|739.4|tonnes|ST}}. The payload to LEO would be {{convert|12800|kg}}, with an increase to {{convert|8500|kg}} to GTO when using an expandable upper stage.<ref name=\"longTermApplications\" />{{rp|219}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Baikal (rocket booster)|Baikal]] - similar Russian system, full-scale mockups build by 2001\n* [[Reusable Booster System]] - similar US system studied in 2010-2012\n* [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]] - partially reusable low earth orbit launch vehicle and basis of the boosters of the [[Falcon Heavy]]\n* [[RETALT]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Reusable launch systems}}\n{{European launch systems}}\n{{European Space Agency}}\n\n[[Category:European Space Agency]]\n[[Category:Ariane (rocket family)]]\n[[Category:Space launch vehicles of Germany]]\n[[Category:Former proposed space launch system concepts]]\n[[Category:Cancelled space launch vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Rod57", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:*LFBB (NASA)- 1970's proposal for LFBB for STS Space Shuttle", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fly-back_booster"}

Oliphant hailed. A retired English headmistress, Oliphant started [[Welham Boys' School]] in 1937. She was struck by [[The Lawrence School, Sanawar]] and lack of schools of similar quality for the girls around Dehradun.\n\nShe acquired a palatial estate called Nasreen adjacent to [[Welham Boys' School]] to start a small boarding school for girls. There were no funds, staff, or school buildings. Oliphant recruited another retired English woman, [[Grace Mary Linnel]], to run the boarding school for girls.
