FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]]. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground. New 1,500&nbsp;hp-class engines powered the designs which could both reach {{convert|43|mph}}, 50% faster than the T-62. Finally, two new guns were introduced, a US 152&nbsp;mm design whose primary long-range weapon was the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missile]], while the Germans introduced a new [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|120 mm smoothbore]] design.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/>\n\nWhile the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget. By 1969, the unit cost stood at five times the original estimates.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/> In August 1969 the Senate halted funding of the program until the [[Government Accounting Office]] could undertake an audit of the program.<ref name=\"GAO Audit\">{{cite news |last1=Weaver Jr. |first1=Warren |title=Tank Fund Halted for a Cost Study |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=9 August 1969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826113509/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |archive-date=26 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Starting afresh===\nAs a result of the problems with the MBT-70, the U.S. Army introduced the XM803, using some technologies from the MBT-70 but removing some of the more troublesome features. This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title=MBT-70 / XM803 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823045247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}</ref> Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the XM1 Abrams named after General [[Creighton Abrams]].\n\nThe [[Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] (TACOM) began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision. Chrysler was the only company that appeared to be seriously interested in tank development; the M60 had been lucrative for the company and relied on that program for much of its profit. In contrast, GM made only about 1% of its income from military sales, compared to 5% for Chrysler, and only submitted their bid after a \"special plea\" from the Pentagon.<ref name=bail/>\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler.<ref name=bail/>\n\n===Production starts===\nLow initial rate production (LIRP) of the vehicle was approved on 7 May 1979.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book |title=Abrams: A History of the American Main Battle Tank |last=Hunnicutt |first=R.P. |publisher=Presidio |year=1990 |isbn=9780891413882 |pages=202}}</ref> In February 1982, [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] Division (GDLS) purchased Chrysler Defense, after Chrysler built over 1,000 M1s.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Dynamics buys Chrysler tank division|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html|publisher=New York Times, 20 February 1982 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403195514/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html |archivedate=3 April 2017 }}</ref> The M1 Abrams was the first vehicle to adopt [[Chobham armor]].\n\n[[File:105mm cannon on an M1 Abrams tank, 1986.png|thumb|left|105 mm M1 Abrams tank of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Grafenw\u00f6hr Training Area in Germany, 1986]]\nA total of 3,273 M1 Abrams tanks were produced during 1979\u20131985 and first entered U.S. Army service in 1980.

M1A2s built for Middle Eastern countries were painted in desert tan.

The remaining hot gasses and metal shrapnel spread out or settle in empty air pockets. Both contractors reevaluated their proposed armor configurations based upon the newly obtained data. This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull. However, the Abrams' turret features composite armoring across both the front and the sides. In addition, the side skirts of the frontal half of the hull are also made of composite, providing superior ballistic protection against chemical energy munitions such as HEAT rounds. The composition of the Abrams' composite armor consists of sandwiched plates of non-explosive [[reactive armor]] (NERA) between conventional steel plates. The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract. Deliveries were expected to be completed by April 2009.<ref name=\"TUSK_def_update\">{{cite web|url=http://defense-update.com/products/t/tusk.htm|title=Tank Urban Survivability Kit (TUSK)|accessdate=11 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013121147/http://defense-update.com/products/t/tusk.htm |archivedate=13 October 2014}}</ref> Under a separate order, the U.S. Army awarded General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GDATP) US$30 million to produce reactive armor kits to equip M1A2s.

Tiles will be produced at the company's reactive armor facility in Stone County Operations, McHenry, Mississippi. On 8 December 2006, the U.S. Army added Counter Improvised Explosive Device enhancements to the M1A1 and M1A2 TUSK, awarding GDLS $11.3&nbsp;million contract, part of the $59&nbsp;million package mentioned above.

This gun used a license-made tube of the British [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun together with the vertical sliding breech block and other parts of the U.S. T254E2 prototype gun. However, it proved to be inadequate; a cannon with lethality beyond the {{convert|3|km|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} range was needed to combat newer armor technologies. To attain that lethality, the projectile diameter needed to be increased.

The M256A1 is a variant of the [[Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm gun|Rheinmetall 120&nbsp;mm L/44 gun]] carried on the German Leopard 2 on all variants up to the Leopard 2A5. Leopard 2A6 replaced the L/44 barrel with a longer L/55. Due to the increased calibre, only 40 or 42 rounds are able to be stored depending on if the tank is an A1 or A2 model.\n\nThe M256A1 fires a variety of rounds. The primary APFSDS round of the Abrams is the [[depleted uranium]] [[M829]] round, of which four variants have been designed. M829A1, known as the \"Silver Bullet\", saw widespread service in the Gulf War, where it proved itself against Iraqi armor such as the T-72.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

The engine represents advancements in diesel engine design since the Abrams was first designed, including a common rail fuel injector system where fuel is pressurized and atomized in the cylinder rather than mechanically sprayed. It also has greater torque, an altered nuclear, biological, and chemical protection system that operates independently of the engine, uses less fuel while idle, is quieter, and gives off significantly less heat and pollutants. Incorporating the diesel engine into the Abrams would decrease the operating cost of an armored brigade combat team by 14 percent per mile, increase its operating range from 205 miles to 300+ miles, and use half the amount of fuel on a combat day than the turbine engine.

FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]]. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground.

This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title=MBT-70 / XM803 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823045247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}</ref> Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the XM1 Abrams named after General [[Creighton Abrams]].\n\nThe [[Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] (TACOM) began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision. Chrysler was the only company that appeared to be seriously interested in tank development; the M60 had been lucrative for the company and relied on that program for much of its profit. In contrast, GM made only about 1% of its income from military sales, compared to 5% for Chrysler, and only submitted their bid after a \"special plea\" from the Pentagon.<ref name=bail/>\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler.<ref name=bail/>\n\n===Production starts===\nLow initial rate production (LIRP) of the vehicle was approved on 7 May 1979.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book |title=Abrams: A History of the American Main Battle Tank |last=Hunnicutt |first=R.P. |publisher=Presidio |year=1990 |isbn=9780891413882 |pages=202}}</ref> In February 1982, [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] Division (GDLS) purchased Chrysler Defense, after Chrysler built over 1,000 M1s.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Dynamics buys Chrysler tank division|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html|publisher=New York Times, 20 February 1982 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403195514/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html |archivedate=3 April 2017 }}</ref> The M1 Abrams was the first vehicle to adopt [[Chobham armor]].\n\n[[File:105mm cannon on an M1 Abrams tank, 1986.png|thumb|left|105 mm M1 Abrams tank of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Grafenw\u00f6hr Training Area in Germany, 1986]]\nA total of 3,273 M1 Abrams tanks were produced during 1979\u20131985 and first entered U.S. Army service in 1980.

Some units painted their M1s with the older Mobility Equipment Research and Design Command (MERDC) 4-color paint scheme but the turn-in requirements for these tanks required repainting them to overall forest green. Therefore, even though a large number of the base model M1s were camouflaged in the field, few or none exist today.\n\nM1A1s came from the factory with the NATO three color camouflage Black/Med-Green/Dark-Brown [[Chemical Agent Resistant Coating]] (CARC) paint jobs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Today M1A1s are given the NATO three color paint job during rebuilds.

M1A2s built for Middle Eastern countries were painted in desert tan. Replacement parts (roadwheels, armor skirt panels, drive sprockets, etc.) are painted olive green, which can sometimes lead to vehicles with a patchwork of green and desert tan parts.\n\nAustralian M1A1s were desert tan when delivered but have undergone a transition to the Australian Army vehicle standard 'Disruptive Pattern Camouflage'; a scheme that consists of black, olive drab, and brown.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Miller |url=http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |title=Australian Military Vehicles Research -Disruptive Pattern Camouflage for the Australian Abrams M1A1 AIM SA (as at 2010) |publisher=Mheaust.com.au |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110249/http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}{{self-published source|date=July 2011}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Australian Government, Department of Defence |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |title=Exercise Chong Ju \u2013 Desert tan vs Auscam Abrams |publisher=Defence.gov.au |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729121247/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |archivedate=29 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army can equip its Abrams tanks with the Saab Barracuda [[Multi-spectral camouflage|camouflage system]], which provides concealment against visual, infrared, thermal infrared, and broad-band radar detection.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html U.S. Army Orders Saab Barracuda Camouflage Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615013237/http://www.armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html |date=15 June 2015}} \u2013 Armyrecognition.com, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n====Concealment====\nThe turret is fitted with two six-barreled [[M250 grenade launcher|M250]] [[smoke grenade]] launchers (USMC M1A1s use an eight-barreled version), with one on each side.

HEAT and sabot rounds will make it through the beginning layers of armor but won't make it to the crew compartment. Ceramics have an ability to absorb a lot of heat, and take physical blows. The remaining hot gasses and metal shrapnel spread out or settle in empty air pockets. Both contractors reevaluated their proposed armor configurations based upon the newly obtained data. This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull. However, the Abrams' turret features composite armoring across both the front and the sides. In addition, the side skirts of the frontal half of the hull are also made of composite, providing superior ballistic protection against chemical energy munitions such as HEAT rounds. The composition of the Abrams' composite armor consists of sandwiched plates of non-explosive [[reactive armor]] (NERA) between conventional steel plates. The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

The Abrams can be carried by a [[C-5 Galaxy]] or a [[C-17 Globemaster III]]. The limited capacity (two combat-ready tanks in a C-5, one combat-ready tank in a C-17) caused serious logistical problems when deploying the tanks for the first Persian Gulf War, though there was enough time for 1,848 tanks to be transported by ship.\n\nMarines transport their [[Marine Air Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF)-attached Abrams tanks by combat ship. A ''[[Wasp class amphibious assault ship|Wasp]]''-class [[Landing Helicopter Dock]] (LHD) typically carries a platoon of 4 to 5 tanks attached to the deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]], which are then amphibiously transported to shore by [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]] (LCAC) at 1 combat-ready tank per landing craft.\n\nThe Abrams is also transportable by truck, namely the [[Oshkosh M1070 heavy equipment transporter|M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter]] (HET). The HET can operate on highways, secondary roads, and cross-country. The HET accommodates the four tank crew members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |title=M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) Fact File United States Army |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020118/http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first instance of the Abrams being airlifted directly into a battlefield occurred in October 1993.

In a 1989 survey in [[California]], fruit with stigmatomycosis were found in 90% of samples collected from late June to mid-September and from all growing areas.\n\n== Symptoms ==\nStigmatomycosis is characterized by a wet, smelly, rancid, slimy [[Seed|kernel]]. Kernels with stigmatomycosis can be 1) small, dark green and partially developed with a brown [[Peridium|funiculus]], 2) well-developed, dark green and rancid, or 3) full-sized but abnormal, being white or light yellow and jelly-like, with a lobed appearance. In contrast, symptoms of kernel [[necrosis]], which is caused by large [[Hemiptera|hemipterans]], are dry, punky, brown areas in the kernel. Sometimes, kernel necrosis and stigmatomycosis symptoms can be present in the same fruit.\n\n== Causal organisms ==\nStigmatomycosis is caused by the [[filamentous fungi]] ''[[Ashbya gossypii]],'' ''[[Eremothecium coryli]]'' (syn. ''Nematospora coryli''), and ''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]''. All of them belong to the phylum of [[ascomycetes]] <br />\n\n== Disease cycle and epidemiology ==\nThe fungi causing stigmatomycosis are associated with [[Hemiptera|hemipteran]] insects of the stinkbug families [[Pentatomidae]] and [[Coreidae]].

Three common stinkbug pests, ''[[Thyanta pallidovirens]]'' (Western red-shouldered stinkbug), ''[[Chlorochroa uhleri]],'' ''[[Chlorochroa ligata]],'' and a [[leaffooted]] bug, ''[[Leptoglossus clypealis]]'' (Coreidae), experimentally transmitted ''[[Eremothecium coryli|E. coryli]],'' which caused typical [[symptoms]] of stigmatomycosis in pistachio [[Seed|kernels]]. Symptoms first appear in late June after pistachio shells have hardened, but the disease becomes frequent in July through September, a period that coincides with kernel development. Smaller hemipterans, such as ''[[Lygus]]'' and ''[[Calocoris]]'', may carry but not transmit the [[pathogens]] because they are unable to puncture the firm fruit [[pericarp]] after the second part of May. Stigmatomycosis and kernel [[necrosis]] are worse in orchards irrigated by [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinklers]] than in those irrigated by drip, [[microjets]], or flood. This suggests either greater humidity requirements for infection, more activity of hemipterans in sprinkler-irrigated orchards, or more abundant pathogen [[propagules]].\n\n== Control ==\n[[Fungicide]]s do not control stigmatomycosis but [[insecticide]]s reduce hemipteran [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] populations and the incidence of stigmatomycosis.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* Themis J.

They are also required to give birth in the bashaleni. There is also a ritual restoring \"purity\" to a woman after childbirth which must be performed before a woman can return to her husband.

It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, ''Tsyam'' (Tsiyam, ts\u00edam), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt ''Chaumos'', impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal\u014dk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \"indrunkot\", or \"indr\u00e9yin\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle.<ref name=Witzel/> Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (\u014dnje\u1e63\u1e6da 'pure'), are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anv\u0101rambha\u1e47a) and snake through the village.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm.

In this festival, a strong prepubescent boy is sent up into the mountains to live with the goats for the summer. He is supposed to get fat and strong from the [[goat milk]]. When the festival comes he is allowed for a 24-hour period only to have sexual intercourse with any woman he wants, including even the wife of another man, or a young virgin. Any child born of this 24-hour period is considered to be blessed. The Kalash claim to have abolished this practice in recent years due to negative worldwide publicity.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt this crucial moment the pure get weaker, and the impure try to take hold of the (very pure) boys, pretend to mount them \"like a hornless ram\", and proceed in snake procession. At this point, the impure men resist and fight. When the \"nagayr\u014d\" song with the response \"han sar\u00edas\" (from *samr\u012byate 'flows together', CDIAL 12995) is voiced, Balumain showers all his blessings and disappears. He gives his blessings to seven boys (representing the mythical seven of the eight Devalog who received him on arrival), and these pass the blessings on to all pure men.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nIn myth, Mahandeu had cheated Balumain from superiority, when all the gods had slept together (a euphemism) in the Shawalo meadow; therefore, he went to the mythical home of the Kalash in Tsiyam (ts\u00edam), to come back next year like the Vedic Indra ([[Rigveda]] 10.86). If this had not happened, Balumain would have taught humans how to have sex as a sacred act. Instead, he could only teach them fertility songs used at the Chaumos ritual. He arrives from the west, the [[Bashgal Valley|Bashgal valley]], in early December, before solstice, and leaves the day after. He was at first shunned by some people, who were annihilated. He was, however, received by seven Devalog and they all went to several villages, such as Batrik village, where seven pure, young boys received him whom he took with him. Therefore, nowadays, one only sends men and older boys to receive him. Balumain is the typical culture hero. He told people about the sacred fire made from junipers, about the sowing ceremony for wheat that involved the blood of a small goat, and he asked for wheat tribute (hushak) for his horse. Finally, Balumain taught how to celebrate the winter festival. He was visible only during his first visit, now he is just felt to be present.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nDuring the winter the Kalash play an inter-village tournament of Chikik Gal (ball game) in which villages compete against each other to hit a ball up and down the valley in deep snow.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Kalash-Frau.jpg|thumb|A Kalash woman in traditional costume]]\nThe Kalash people are divided equally between the adherents of Islam,{{efn|<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/>}}<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/> and those that practice the traditional Kalash religion, which some observers label as [[animism]],<ref name=\"Searle2013\"/><ref name=\"Camerapix1998\"/><ref name=\"Sheehan1993\"/><ref name=\"Pelton1997\">{{cite book|author=Robert Young Pelton|title=Fielding's the World's Most Dangerous Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVY1qg1hiNYC|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Fielding Worldwide|isbn=978-1-56952-140-3|quote=.The Kalash (which means black because of the black garments they wear) are an animist tribe who live in a region sometimes called Kafiristan.}}</ref> but other academics as \"a form of [[ancient Hinduism]]\".<ref name=\"West2010\"/><ref name=\"Bezhan2017\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1324805|title=Peshawar High Court orders govt to include Kalasha religion in census|last=Akbar|first=Ali|date=4 April 2017|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|language=English|accessdate=11 July 2017|quote=Kalasha, the religion followed by Kalash community, lies between Islam and an ancient form of Hinduism.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sanskrit]] linguist [[Michael Witzel]], the traditional Kalash religion shares \"many of the traits of myths, ritual, society, and echoes many aspects of [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [religion]\" but not of the post-Rigvedic religion that later developed in other parts of India.<ref name=Witzel>{{citation |first=Michael |last=Witzel |authorlink=Michael Witzel |chapter=Kalash Religion (extract from 'The \u1e5agvedic Religious System and its Central Asian and Hindukush Antecedents') |editor1=A.

Importantly, the division between two groups of deities ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devalog]]) and their intermarriage (Imra's mother is a 'giant') has been preserved, and this dichotomy is still re-enacted in rituals and festivals, especially the Chaumos.

Even the recently popular Balumain (ba\u1e37ima\u00edn, K.) has taken over some of Indra's features: He comes from the outside, riding on a horse. Balumain is a culture hero who taught how to celebrate the Kalash winter festival (Chaumos). He is connected with ''Tsyam'', the mythological homeland of the Kalash. Indr has a demon-like counterpart, Je\u1e63\u1e6dan, who appears on earth as a dog; the gods (Devalog, Dewal\u00f3k) are his enemies and throw stones at him, the shooting stars.<ref name=Witzel />\n\n;Munjem Mal\u00e9k:\nAnother god, Munjem Mal\u00e9k (munjem 'middle'; mal\u00e9k from Arab. malik 'king'), is the Lord of Middle Earth and killed, like the Indra, his father.

They are also required to give birth in the bashaleni. There is also a ritual restoring \"purity\" to a woman after childbirth which must be performed before a woman can return to her husband.

It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, ''Tsyam'' (Tsiyam, ts\u00edam), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt ''Chaumos'', impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal\u014dk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \"indrunkot\", or \"indr\u00e9yin\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle.<ref name=Witzel/> Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (\u014dnje\u1e63\u1e6da 'pure'), are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anv\u0101rambha\u1e47a) and snake through the village.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm.

In this festival, a strong prepubescent boy is sent up into the mountains to live with the goats for the summer. He is supposed to get fat and strong from the [[goat milk]]. When the festival comes he is allowed for a 24-hour period only to have sexual intercourse with any woman he wants, including even the wife of another man, or a young virgin. Any child born of this 24-hour period is considered to be blessed. The Kalash claim to have abolished this practice in recent years due to negative worldwide publicity.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt this crucial moment the pure get weaker, and the impure try to take hold of the (very pure) boys, pretend to mount them \"like a hornless ram\", and proceed in snake procession. At this point, the impure men resist and fight. When the \"nagayr\u014d\" song with the response \"han sar\u00edas\" (from *samr\u012byate 'flows together', CDIAL 12995) is voiced, Balumain showers all his blessings and disappears. He gives his blessings to seven boys (representing the mythical seven of the eight Devalog who received him on arrival), and these pass the blessings on to all pure men.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nIn myth, Mahandeu had cheated Balumain from superiority, when all the gods had slept together (a euphemism) in the Shawalo meadow; therefore, he went to the mythical home of the Kalash in Tsiyam (ts\u00edam), to come back next year like the Vedic Indra ([[Rigveda]] 10.86). If this had not happened, Balumain would have taught humans how to have sex as a sacred act. Instead, he could only teach them fertility songs used at the Chaumos ritual. He arrives from the west, the [[Bashgal Valley|Bashgal valley]], in early December, before solstice, and leaves the day after. He was at first shunned by some people, who were annihilated. He was, however, received by seven Devalog and they all went to several villages, such as Batrik village, where seven pure, young boys received him whom he took with him. Therefore, nowadays, one only sends men and older boys to receive him. Balumain is the typical culture hero. He told people about the sacred fire made from junipers, about the sowing ceremony for wheat that involved the blood of a small goat, and he asked for wheat tribute (hushak) for his horse. Finally, Balumain taught how to celebrate the winter festival. He was visible only during his first visit, now he is just felt to be present.<ref name=Witzel />\n\nDuring the winter the Kalash play an inter-village tournament of Chikik Gal (ball game) in which villages compete against each other to hit a ball up and down the valley in deep snow.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Kalash-Frau.jpg|thumb|A Kalash woman in traditional costume]]\nThe Kalash people are divided equally between the adherents of Islam,{{efn|<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/>}}<ref name=\"Pakistan Statistical Year Book 2012\"/> and those that practice the traditional Kalash religion, which some observers label as [[animism]],<ref name=\"Searle2013\"/><ref name=\"Camerapix1998\"/><ref name=\"Sheehan1993\"/><ref name=\"Pelton1997\">{{cite book|author=Robert Young Pelton|title=Fielding's the World's Most Dangerous Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVY1qg1hiNYC|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Fielding Worldwide|isbn=978-1-56952-140-3|quote=.The Kalash (which means black because of the black garments they wear) are an animist tribe who live in a region sometimes called Kafiristan.}}</ref> but other academics as \"a form of [[ancient Hinduism]]\".<ref name=\"West2010\"/><ref name=\"Bezhan2017\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1324805|title=Peshawar High Court orders govt to include Kalasha religion in census|last=Akbar|first=Ali|date=4 April 2017|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|language=English|accessdate=11 July 2017|quote=Kalasha, the religion followed by Kalash community, lies between Islam and an ancient form of Hinduism.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sanskrit]] linguist [[Michael Witzel]], the traditional Kalash religion shares \"many of the traits of myths, ritual, society, and echoes many aspects of [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] [religion]\" but not of the post-Rigvedic religion that later developed in other parts of India.<ref name=Witzel>{{citation |first=Michael |last=Witzel |authorlink=Michael Witzel |chapter=Kalash Religion (extract from 'The \u1e5agvedic Religious System and its Central Asian and Hindukush Antecedents') |editor1=A.

Importantly, the division between two groups of deities ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devalog]]) and their intermarriage (Imra's mother is a 'giant') has been preserved, and this dichotomy is still re-enacted in rituals and festivals, especially the Chaumos.

Even the recently popular Balumain (ba\u1e37ima\u00edn, K.) has taken over some of Indra's features: He comes from the outside, riding on a horse. Balumain is a culture hero who taught how to celebrate the Kalash winter festival (Chaumos). He is connected with ''Tsyam'', the mythological homeland of the Kalash. Indr has a demon-like counterpart, Je\u1e63\u1e6dan, who appears on earth as a dog; the gods (Devalog, Dewal\u00f3k) are his enemies and throw stones at him, the shooting stars.<ref name=Witzel />\n\n;Munjem Mal\u00e9k:\nAnother god, Munjem Mal\u00e9k (munjem 'middle'; mal\u00e9k from Arab. malik 'king'), is the Lord of Middle Earth and killed, like the Indra, his father.

He then has Alice calculate the number of unbirthdays in a year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carroll, Lewis|year=1872|title=Through the looking-glass, and what Alice found there|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|place=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/throughlookinggl01carr#page/122/mode/2up/|pages=121\u2013123}}</ref>\n\nIn the Disney animated film ''Alice in Wonderland'', Alice stumbles upon the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], the [[March Hare]] and the [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]] having an unbirthday party and singing \"The Unbirthday Song\" (music and lyrics by [[Mack David]], [[Al Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Livingston]]). Alice at first doesn't realize what an unbirthday is; when the Mad Hatter explains it to her, she realizes it is ''her'' unbirthday as well, and receives an unbirthday cake from the Mad Hatter. The scene from the film combines the idea of an unbirthday introduced in ''Through the Looking-Glass'' with the \"Mad Tea Party\" described in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.<ref>[[Lewis Carroll]] (1865). ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. [[s:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Chapter 7|Chapter VII, \"A Mad Tea Party\"]].</ref> Later in the film; the Mad Hatter mentions this unbirthday party when he is summoned as a witness at Alice's trial. The [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] realizes that it's the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts']] unbirthday as well, and the trial is abruptly halted to celebrate.\n\nThe unbirthday party is also the subject of a 1951 [[Comics|comic]] released to coincide with the film.<ref>[[Walt Disney Productions]] (1951). ''[http://www.nonsenselit.org/comics/walt-disneys-unbirthday-party-with-alice/ Walt Disney's Unbirthday Party with Alice in Wonderland]''. [[Dell Comics|Dell Four Color Comics]] No.&nbsp;341.</ref> The comic version is substantially longer (32&nbsp;pages) than the scene in the animated film, and has Alice being invited to the unbirthday party of [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] (who are not actually present at the unbirthday party). Humpty Dumpty is a character in the comic version, although not in the manner in which he appears in ''Through the Looking-Glass''.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*''[[s:Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass]]'' at [[Wikisource]]\n\n{{Alice|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Alice in Wonderland]]\n[[Category:Unofficial observances]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n[[Category:Birthdays]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1870s]]\n", "name_user": "David91x", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f (\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0647) \u0647\u0648 \u062d\u062f\u062b \u064a\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0640 364 (365 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0633\u0629) \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635.  \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0635\u0627\u063a\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u064a\u0633 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 1871 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0622\u0629 \u060c [1] [2] \u0645\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \"\u0623\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 Unbirthday\" \u0641\u064a \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0639\u0627\u0645 1951 \u0623\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0628.

Mycoprotein is rich in fiber and protein content, but very low in fat, making it a desirable food source for consumers trying to limit fat intake while still participating in a high protein diet.\n\n''F. venenatum''<nowiki/>'s high fiber content also has potential in managing blood sugar levels. The mechanism that links fiber content and F. venenatum's effect on managing glycemia and insulenaemia is not completely understood, but it is known to decrease the rate of glucose absorption and insulin secretion and it helps mitigate the maximum limit an amount of insulin can process glucose, known as insulin peak.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=A.|last2=Aisbitt|first2=B.|last3=Lunn|first3=J.|date=2008-12-01|title=Mycoprotein and health|url=https://insights.ovid.com/nutrition-bulletin/nutbu/2008/12/000/mycoprotein-health/5/00094955|journal=Nutrition Bulletin|language=ENGLISH|volume=33|issue=4|issn=1471-9827}}</ref>\n\nUnder optimum conditions ''F. venenatum'' biomass can be 42% protein while also functioning as a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] material for the lower gut.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Fusarium venenatum]]''\n* [[Fungiculture]]\n* [[Mold|Filamentous fungi]]\n* [[Quorn]]\n* [[Protein quality]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal| first1 = M.G.| last1 =  Wiebe| title = Myco-protein from Fusarium venenatum: a well-established product for human consumption| journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology| volume = 58| pages = 421\u20137| doi = 10.1007/s00253-002-0931-x| issue = 4| year = 2002| pmid = 11954786}}\n\n[[Category:Fungal proteins]]\n[[Category:Meat substitutes]]\n[[Category:Single-cell protein]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "link mold in text", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoprotein"}
