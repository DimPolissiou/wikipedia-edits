Electrostatic induction laws apply in dynamic situations as far as the [[quasistatic approximation]] is valid.  Electrostatic induction should not be confused with [[Electromagnetic induction]].\n\n== Explanation ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   = \n| image1   = Electrostatic induction experiment.png\n| caption1 = Demonstration of induction, in the 1870s. The positive terminal of an [[electrostatic machine]] ''(right)'' is placed near an uncharged brass cylinder ''(left)'', causing the left end to acquire a positive charge and the right to acquire a negative charge. The small [[pith ball electroscope]]s hanging from the bottom show that the charge is concentrated at the ends.\n| width1   = 260\n| image2   = Cat_demonstrating_static_cling_with_styrofoam_peanuts.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Styrofoam peanut]]s clinging to a cat's fur. The [[static electricity]] that builds up on the fur causes a polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to electrostatic induction, resulting in a slight attraction of the styrofoam to the charged fur.\n| width2   = 276\n}}\n\nA normal uncharged piece of matter has equal numbers of positive and negative [[electric charge]]s in each part of it, located close together, so no part of it has a net electric charge.   The positive charges are the [[atom]]s' [[atomic nuclei|nuclei]] which are bound into the structure of matter and are not free to move.  The negative charges are the atoms' [[electron]]s.  In [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] objects such as metals, some of the electrons are able to move freely about in the object.\n\nWhen a charged object is brought near an uncharged, [[Electrical conductor|electrically conducting]] object, such as a piece of metal, the force of the nearby charge due to [[Coulomb's law]] causes a separation of these internal charges.  For example, if a positive charge is brought near the object (see picture of cylindrical electrode near electrostatic machine), the electrons in the metal will be attracted toward it and move to the side of the object facing it.  When the electrons move out of an area, they leave an unbalanced positive charge due to the nuclei.   This results in a region of negative charge on the object nearest to the external charge, and a region of positive charge on the part away from it.  These are called ''induced charges''.  If the external charge is negative, the polarity of the charged regions will be reversed.\n\nSince this process is just a redistribution of the charges that were already in the object, it doesn't change the ''total'' charge on the object; it still has no net charge.  This induction effect is reversible; if the nearby charge is removed, the attraction between the positive and negative internal charges causes them to intermingle again.\n\n== Charging an object by induction ==\n[[Image:Electroscope showing induction.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Gold-leaf electroscope, showing induction, before the terminal is grounded.]]\n[[File:13. \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u0441\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043b\u0443\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0430.ogv|thumb|right|222px|Using an electroscope to show electrostatic induction. The device has leaves/needle that become charged when introducing a charged rod to it. The leaves bend the leave/needle, and the stronger the static introduced, the more bending occurs.]]\n\nHowever, the induction effect can also be used to put a net charge on an object.  If, while it is close to the positive charge, the above object is momentarily connected through a [[electrical conductor|conductive]] path to [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]], which is a large reservoir of both positive and negative charges, some of the negative charges in the ground will flow into the object, under the attraction of the nearby positive charge.  When the contact with ground is broken, the object is left with a net negative charge.\n\nThis method can be demonstrated using a [[gold-leaf electroscope]], which is an instrument for detecting electric charge.  The electroscope is first discharged, and a charged object is then brought close to the instrument's top terminal.  Induction causes a separation of the charges inside the [[electroscope]]'s metal rod, so that the top terminal gains a net charge of opposite polarity to that of the object, while the gold leaves gain a charge of the same polarity.  Since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other and spread apart.  The electroscope has not acquired a net charge: the charge within it has merely been redistributed, so if the charged object were to be moved away from the electroscope the leaves will come together again.\n\nBut if an electrical contact is now briefly made between the electroscope terminal and [[ground (electricity)|ground]], for example by touching the terminal with a finger,  this causes charge to flow from ground to the terminal, attracted by the charge on the object close to the terminal.  This charge neutralizes the charge in the gold leaves, so the leaves come together again.  The electroscope now contains a net charge opposite in polarity to that of the charged object.  When the electrical contact to earth is broken, e.g. by lifting the finger, the extra charge that has just flowed into the electroscope cannot escape, and the instrument retains a net charge.  The charge is held in the top of the electroscope terminal by the attraction of the inducing charge.  But when the inducing charge is moved away, the charge is released and spreads throughout the electroscope terminal to the leaves, so the gold leaves move apart again.\n\nThe sign of the charge left on the electroscope after grounding is always opposite in sign to the external inducing charge.<ref name=\"Cope\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Cope\n  | first = Thomas A.

These induced surface charges create an opposing electric field that exactly cancels the field of the external charge throughout the interior of the metal.  Therefore electrostatic induction ensures that the electric field everywhere inside a conductive object is zero.]]\n\nA remaining question is how large the induced charges are.   The movement of charges is caused by the [[force]] exerted on them by the [[electric field]] of the external charged object, by [[Coulomb's law]].  As the charges in the metal object continue to separate, the resulting positive and negative regions create their own electric field, which opposes the field of the external charge.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />   This process continues until very quickly (within a fraction of a second) an [[Equilibrium state|equilibrium]] is reached in which the induced charges are exactly the right size to cancel the external electric field throughout the interior of the metal object.<ref name=\"Purcell\" /><ref name=\"Saslow\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Saslow\n  | first = Wayne M. \n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Electricity, magnetism, and light\n  | publisher = Academic Press\n  | year = 2002\n  | location = US\n  | pages = 159\u2013161\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4liwlxqt9NIC&pg=PA159&dq=electrostatic+induction+equilibrium\n  | isbn = 0-12-619455-6}}</ref>  Then the remaining mobile charges (electrons) in the interior of the metal no longer feel a force and the net motion of the charges stops.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\n==Induced charge resides on the surface==\nSince the mobile charges in the interior of a metal object are free to move in any direction, there can never be a static concentration of charge inside the metal; if there was, it would attract opposite polarity charge to neutralize it.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />  Therefore in induction, the mobile charges move under the influence of the external charge until they reach the surface of the metal and collect there, where they are constrained from moving by the boundary.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\nThis establishes the important principle that electrostatic charges on conductive objects reside on the surface of the object.<ref name=\"Purcell\" /><ref name=\"Saslow\" />  External electric fields induce surface charges on metal objects that exactly cancel the field within.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\n==The voltage throughout a conductive object is constant==\nThe [[electrostatic potential]] or [[voltage]] between two points is defined as the [[energy]] (work) required to move a small charge through an electric field between the two points, divided by the size of the charge.

Electrostatic induction laws apply in dynamic situations as far as the [[quasistatic approximation]] is valid.  Electrostatic induction should not be confused with [[Electromagnetic induction]].\n\n== Explanation ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   = \n| image1   = Electrostatic induction experiment.png\n| caption1 = Demonstration of induction, in the 1870s. The positive terminal of an [[electrostatic machine]] ''(right)'' is placed near an uncharged brass cylinder ''(left)'', causing the left end to acquire a positive charge and the right to acquire a negative charge. The small [[pith ball electroscope]]s hanging from the bottom show that the charge is concentrated at the ends.\n| width1   = 260\n| image2   = Cat_demonstrating_static_cling_with_styrofoam_peanuts.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Styrofoam peanut]]s clinging to a cat's fur. The [[static electricity]] that builds up on the fur causes a polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to electrostatic induction, resulting in a slight attraction of the styrofoam to the charged fur.\n| width2   = 276\n}}\n\nA normal uncharged piece of matter has equal numbers of positive and negative [[electric charge]]s in each part of it, located close together, so no part of it has a net electric charge.   The positive charges are the [[atom]]s' [[atomic nuclei|nuclei]] which are bound into the structure of matter and are not free to move.  The negative charges are the atoms' [[electron]]s.  In [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] objects such as metals, some of the electrons are able to move freely about in the object.\n\nWhen a charged object is brought near an uncharged, [[Electrical conductor|electrically conducting]] object, such as a piece of metal, the force of the nearby charge due to [[Coulomb's law]] causes a separation of these internal charges.  For example, if a positive charge is brought near the object (see picture of cylindrical electrode near electrostatic machine), the electrons in the metal will be attracted toward it and move to the side of the object facing it.  When the electrons move out of an area, they leave an unbalanced positive charge due to the nuclei.   This results in a region of negative charge on the object nearest to the external charge, and a region of positive charge on the part away from it.  These are called ''induced charges''.  If the external charge is negative, the polarity of the charged regions will be reversed.\n\nSince this process is just a redistribution of the charges that were already in the object, it doesn't change the ''total'' charge on the object; it still has no net charge.  This induction effect is reversible; if the nearby charge is removed, the attraction between the positive and negative internal charges causes them to intermingle again.\n\n== Charging an object by induction ==\n[[Image:Electroscope showing induction.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Gold-leaf electroscope, showing induction, before the terminal is grounded.]]\n[[File:13. \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u0441\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043b\u0443\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0430.ogv|thumb|right|222px|Using an electroscope to show electrostatic induction. The device has leaves/needle that become charged when introducing a charged rod to it. The leaves bend the leave/needle, and the stronger the static introduced, the more bending occurs.]]\n\nHowever, the induction effect can also be used to put a net charge on an object.  If, while it is close to the positive charge, the above object is momentarily connected through a [[electrical conductor|conductive]] path to [[ground (electricity)|electrical ground]], which is a large reservoir of both positive and negative charges, some of the negative charges in the ground will flow into the object, under the attraction of the nearby positive charge.  When the contact with ground is broken, the object is left with a net negative charge.\n\nThis method can be demonstrated using a [[gold-leaf electroscope]], which is an instrument for detecting electric charge.  The electroscope is first discharged, and a charged object is then brought close to the instrument's top terminal.  Induction causes a separation of the charges inside the [[electroscope]]'s metal rod, so that the top terminal gains a net charge of opposite polarity to that of the object, while the gold leaves gain a charge of the same polarity.  Since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other and spread apart.  The electroscope has not acquired a net charge: the charge within it has merely been redistributed, so if the charged object were to be moved away from the electroscope the leaves will come together again.\n\nBut if an electrical contact is now briefly made between the electroscope terminal and [[ground (electricity)|ground]], for example by touching the terminal with a finger,  this causes charge to flow from ground to the terminal, attracted by the charge on the object close to the terminal.  This charge neutralizes the charge in the gold leaves, so the leaves come together again.  The electroscope now contains a net charge opposite in polarity to that of the charged object.  When the electrical contact to earth is broken, e.g. by lifting the finger, the extra charge that has just flowed into the electroscope cannot escape, and the instrument retains a net charge.  The charge is held in the top of the electroscope terminal by the attraction of the inducing charge.  But when the inducing charge is moved away, the charge is released and spreads throughout the electroscope terminal to the leaves, so the gold leaves move apart again.\n\nThe sign of the charge left on the electroscope after grounding is always opposite in sign to the external inducing charge.<ref name=\"Cope\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Cope\n  | first = Thomas A.

These induced surface charges create an opposing electric field that exactly cancels the field of the external charge throughout the interior of the metal.  Therefore electrostatic induction ensures that the electric field everywhere inside a conductive object is zero.]]\n\nA remaining question is how large the induced charges are.   The movement of charges is caused by the [[force]] exerted on them by the [[electric field]] of the external charged object, by [[Coulomb's law]].  As the charges in the metal object continue to separate, the resulting positive and negative regions create their own electric field, which opposes the field of the external charge.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />   This process continues until very quickly (within a fraction of a second) an [[Equilibrium state|equilibrium]] is reached in which the induced charges are exactly the right size to cancel the external electric field throughout the interior of the metal object.<ref name=\"Purcell\" /><ref name=\"Saslow\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Saslow\n  | first = Wayne M. \n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Electricity, magnetism, and light\n  | publisher = Academic Press\n  | year = 2002\n  | location = US\n  | pages = 159\u2013161\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4liwlxqt9NIC&pg=PA159&dq=electrostatic+induction+equilibrium\n  | isbn = 0-12-619455-6}}</ref>  Then the remaining mobile charges (electrons) in the interior of the metal no longer feel a force and the net motion of the charges stops.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\n==Induced charge resides on the surface==\nSince the mobile charges in the interior of a metal object are free to move in any direction, there can never be a static concentration of charge inside the metal; if there was, it would attract opposite polarity charge to neutralize it.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />  Therefore in induction, the mobile charges move under the influence of the external charge until they reach the surface of the metal and collect there, where they are constrained from moving by the boundary.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\nThis establishes the important principle that electrostatic charges on conductive objects reside on the surface of the object.<ref name=\"Purcell\" /><ref name=\"Saslow\" />  External electric fields induce surface charges on metal objects that exactly cancel the field within.<ref name=\"Purcell\" />\n\n==The voltage throughout a conductive object is constant==\nThe [[electrostatic potential]] or [[voltage]] between two points is defined as the [[energy]] (work) required to move a small charge through an electric field between the two points, divided by the size of the charge.

Work will have to be done on the charge by a force to make it move to <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> against the opposing force of the electric field.  Thus the electrostatic potential energy of the charge will increase.   So the potential at point  <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is higher than at point <math>\\mathbf{a}</math>.

Proteolytic bacteria such as [[clostridia]], which are part of the normal gut microbiota, produce toxic substances including [[phenols]], [[Indole|indols]], and [[ammonia]] from the [[digestion]] of [[proteins]]. According to Metchnikoff, these compounds were responsible for what he called \"intestinal [[autointoxication]]\", which would cause the physical changes associated with old age.<ref>Arteriosclerosis and intestinal poisons.

Metchnikoff had also observed that certain rural populations in Europe, for example in Bulgaria and the Russian steppes, who lived largely on milk fermented by lactic-acid bacteria, were exceptionally long-lived. Based on these observations, Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk would \"seed\" the [[intestine]] with harmless lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH, and that this would suppress the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Metchnikoff himself introduced in his diet [[sour milk]] fermented with the bacteria he called \"Bulgarian Bacillus\" and believed his health benefited.

Proteolytic bacteria such as [[clostridia]], which are part of the normal gut microbiota, produce toxic substances including [[phenols]], [[Indole|indols]], and [[ammonia]] from the [[digestion]] of [[proteins]]. According to Metchnikoff, these compounds were responsible for what he called \"intestinal [[autointoxication]]\", which would cause the physical changes associated with old age.<ref>Arteriosclerosis and intestinal poisons.

Metchnikoff had also observed that certain rural populations in Europe, for example in Bulgaria and the Russian steppes, who lived largely on milk fermented by lactic-acid bacteria, were exceptionally long-lived. Based on these observations, Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk would \"seed\" the [[intestine]] with harmless lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH, and that this would suppress the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Metchnikoff himself introduced in his diet [[sour milk]] fermented with the bacteria he called \"Bulgarian Bacillus\" and believed his health benefited.

By the time the Orange Order was formed, the United Irishmen had become a revolutionary group advocating an independent Irish republic that would \"Unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter\". United Irishmen activity was on the rise, and the government hoped to thwart it by backing the Orange Order from 1796 onward.<ref name=\"the1994\">The Cause of Ireland: From the United Irishmen to Partition, Liz Curtis, Beyond the Pale Publications, Belfast, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9514229-6-0}} pg.9</ref> [[Irish nationalist]] historians [[Thomas A.

Many Catholics supported the Act, but the Orange Order saw it as a threat to the \"Protestant constitution\" and 36 lodges in counties Armagh and Monaghan alone passed declarations opposing the Union.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/>\n\n===Suppression===\n[[File:Dollysbrae Road - geograph.org.uk - 100732.jpg|thumb|left|Dolly's Brae, site of the \"[[Dolly's Brae conflict|Battle of Dolly's Brae]]\" (1849) between Orangemen and Catholic Ribbonmen]]\nIn the early nineteenth century, Orangemen were heavily involved in violent conflict with an Irish Catholic secret society called the [[Ribbonism|Ribbonmen]]. One instance, publicised in a 7 October 1816 edition of the ''Boston Commercial Gazette'', included the murder of a Catholic priest and several members of the congregation of Dumreilly parish in [[County Cavan]] on 25 May 1816. According to the article, \"A number of Orangemen with arms rushed into the church and fired upon the congregation\".<ref>Murder in Ireland. (7 October 1816 ). Boston Commercial Gazette, http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3410213113_a106a44149_o.jpg</ref> On 19 July 1823 the Unlawful Oaths Bill was passed, banning all oath-bound societies in Ireland. This included the Orange Order, which had to be dissolved and reconstituted. In 1825 a bill banning unlawful associations \u2013 largely directed at [[Daniel O'Connell]] and his [[Catholic Association]], compelled the Orangemen once more to dissolve their association. When [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] finally granted [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, Roman Catholics were free to take seats as MPs (and take up various other positions of influence and power from which they had been excluded) and play a part in framing the laws of the land. The likelihood of Irish Catholic members holding the balance of power in the Westminster Parliament further increased the alarm of Orangemen in Ireland, as O'Connell's 'Repeal' movement aimed to bring about the restoration of a separate Irish Parliament in Dublin, which would have a Catholic majority, thereby ending to the Protestant Ascendancy. From this moment on, the Orange Order re-emerged in a new and even more militant form.<ref>Tony Gray ''The Orange Order'', Rodley Head London (1972), pp. 103\u2013106 {{ISBN|0-370-01340-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1836 the Order was accused of plotting to place [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] when [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] died; once the plot was revealed the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order.<ref>\"The Cumberland Plot\"  New Zealand Tablet, Volume XXIX, Issue 5, 31 January 1901, Page 3</ref> Under pressure from [[Joseph Hume]], [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|William Molesworth]] and [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.<ref>Murphy, James H.

This was eventually lifted after a campaign of disobedience led by [[William Johnston of Ballykilbeg]].\n\n===Revival===\nBy the late 19th century, the Order was in decline.

Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of [[Ulster]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split when [[Thomas Sloan]] left the organisation to set up the [[Independent Orange Order]]. Sloan had been suspended after running against the official unionist candidate on a pro-[[Belfast Protestant Association]] platform in the [[1902 Belfast South by-election]].\n\n===Role in the partition of Ireland===\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (130).JPG|thumb|An [[Banners in Northern Ireland|Orange banner]] showing the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date = March 2008}}\nIn 1912 the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|British House of Commons]]. However, its introduction would be delayed until 1914.

In 1913 the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], an Ulster-wide militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914, in what became known as the [[Larne gun-running]].\n\nHowever, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I]] in August 1914, which caused the Home Rule Bill to be suspended for the duration of the war. Many Orangemen served in the war with the [[36th (Ulster) Division]], suffering heavy losses, and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]; the six northeastern counties of Ulster became [[Northern Ireland]] and the other twenty-six counties became [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. This self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed in its status under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, and in its borders by the [[Boundary Commission (Ireland)|Boundary Commission]] agreement of 1925. Southern Ireland became first the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 and then in 1949 a [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]].\n\n===Since 1921===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|300px|thumb|Orangeman [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], the first [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].]]\nThe Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland.

The focus then shifted to the return leg along Garvaghy Road.<ref name=\"BBC2002\"/>\n\nEach July from 1995 to 2000, the dispute drew worldwide attention as it sparked protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, prompted a massive [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|police]]/[[British Army|army]] operation, and threatened to derail the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]].<ref name=\"BBC2002\"/><ref name=\"BBC1999\"/> The situation in Portadown was likened to a \"war zone\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/03/northernireland.stuartmillar \"Parade fervour turns country lane into war zone\"].

This led to a standoff at Drumcree between the security forces and thousands of [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]]. Following a wave of loyalist violence, the march was allowed through. In 1997, security forces locked down the Catholic area and forced the march through, citing loyalist threats. This sparked [[1997 nationalist riots in Northern Ireland|widespread protests and violence]] by Irish nationalists.

In [[County Fermanagh]], where the Catholic and Protestant populations are close to parity, membership in 1971 was three times as high as in the more Protestant counties of Antrim and Down, where it was just over 10% of adult Protestant males.<ref>http://www.sneps.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1-Dominant-Ethnicity-demography-and-conflict_revision-Dec2010.pdf</ref> Other factors that are associated with high rates of membership are levels of unemployment that more closely match Catholic levels, and low levels of support for the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] among unionists.\n\n==Beliefs and activities==\n[[File:Orangeorder2004.jpg|thumb|Orange Order poster depicting historical and religious symbols.]]\n\n===Protestantism===\nThe basis of the modern Orange Order is the promotion and propagation of \"biblical [[Protestantism]]\" and the principles of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, [[Creed#Christians without creeds|non-creedal]] and non-[[Trinitarian]] Christians are also banned. This includes members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]], and some branches of [[Quakers]].\n\nPrevious rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"ExplainingNI\"/><ref name=\"TOM\"/> but the current rules  use the wording \"non-reformed faith\" instead. Converts to Protestantism can join by appealing to Grand Lodge.\n\n====Masonic influences====\nJames Wilson and James Sloan, who issued the warrants for the first Lodges of the Orange Order along with 'Diamond' Dan Winter, were [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]],<ref name=\"original\"/> and in the 19th century many Irish Republicans regarded the Orange Order as a [[front group]] established by Unionist Masons as a more violent and jingoist vehicle for the promotion of Unionism.<ref name=\"Cawley1993\">{{cite book|last1=Cawley|first1=Peter|editor1-last=Fideler|editor1-first=David|title=Alexandria, Volume 2|date=1993|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|page=269|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sboJPPCBpuQC&pg=PA269|accessdate=21 January 2018|chapter=The Castle of Heroes: W B Yeats Celtic Mystical Order}}</ref> Some anti-Masonic [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] groups have claimed that the Orange Order is still influenced by freemasonry.<ref>{{cite web | title = Inside the Hidden World of Secret Societies | publisher = Evangelical Truth | url = http://www.evangelicaltruth.com/}} (An example)</ref> Many Masonic traditions survive, such as the organisation of the Order into lodges. The Order has a similar system of degrees through which new members advance. These degrees are interactive plays with references to the Bible.

When [[the Twelfth|the Twelfth of July]] falls on a Sunday the parades traditionally held on that date are held the next day instead. In March 2002, the Order threatened \"to take every action necessary, regardless of the consequences\" to prevent the [[Ballymena]] Show being held on a Sunday.<ref name=\"c02\">{{cite web | title = A Draft Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 2002 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch02.htm | publisher = CAIN | accessdate =9 February 2008}}</ref> The [[County Antrim]] Agricultural Association complied with the Order's wishes.<ref name=\"c02\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nThe Orange Order is strongly linked to [[British unionism]].<ref>Tonge, Johnathan.

Due to its close links with the UUP, the Orange Order was able to exert great influence. The Order was the force behind the UUP no-confidence votes in reformist [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Ministers]] [[Terence O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of the Maine|Terence O'Neill]] (1969), [[James Chichester-Clark]] (1969\u201371), and [[Brian Faulkner]] (1972\u201374).<ref name=\"orange\"/> At the outbreak of [[The Troubles]] in 1969, the Order encouraged its members to join the Northern Ireland security forces.<ref name=\"portadowntimesapril07\"/> The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) attracted the most seats in an election for the first time in 2003.

[[Mortimer O'Sullivan]], a converted Roman Catholic, was a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland. In the 1950s, Scotland also had a former Roman Catholic as a Grand Chaplain, the Rev. William McDermott.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Orange Institution in Ireland has the structure of a pyramid. At its base are about 1400 private lodges; every Orangeman belongs to a private lodge. Each private lodge sends six representatives to the district lodge, of which there are 126. Depending on size, each district lodge sends seven to thirteen representatives to the county lodge, of which there are 12. Each of these sends representatives to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which heads the Orange Order.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Ireland has 373 members. As a result, much of the real power in the Order resides in the Central Committee of the Grand Lodge, which is made up of three members from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland (Down, Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh) as well as the two other County Lodges in Northern Ireland, the City of Belfast Grand Lodge and the City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge, two each from the remaining Ulster counties (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan), one from Leitrim, and 19 others. There are other committees of the Grand Lodge, including rules revision, finance, and education.\n\nDespite this hierarchy, private lodges are basically autonomous as long as they generally obey the rules of the Institution. Breaking these can lead to suspension of the lodge's warrant \u2013 essentially the dissolution of the lodge \u2013 by the Grand Lodge, but this rarely occurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Private lodges may disobey policies laid down by senior lodges without consequence. For example, several lodges have failed to expel members convicted of murder despite a rule stating that anyone convicted of a serious crime should be expelled,<ref>Peter Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London, 1999, pp.151\u20132.</ref> and [[Portadown]] lodges have negotiated with the [[Parades Commission]] in defiance of Grand Lodge policy that the Commission should not be acknowledged.\n\nPrivate lodges wishing to change Orange Order rules or policy can submit a resolution to their district lodge, which may submit it upwards until it eventually reaches the Grand Lodge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAll Lodge meetings commence with the reading of the Bible and prayers that non-practising Protestants, Roman Catholics and people of other faiths and none, 'may become wise unto salvation' (which is direct quote from 2 Timothy 3:15 in the Bible).<ref>Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Resolutions 2011, http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/press/Orange-Standard/2011-Standard/1107-Julyl2011/article2.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n| title        = So What Really Happens Behind Lodge Doors\n| url          = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/so-what-really-happens-behind-lodge-doors-13443749.html\n| newspaper    = Belfast Telegraph\n| location     = \n| date         = \n| access-date  =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Related organisations==\n[[File:Orange marcher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Orangewoman marching in an Orange Order parade in [[Glasgow]].]]\n\n===Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland===\nA distinct<ref name=\"MJess\">{{cite web | last = Jess | first = Mervyn | title = So, what really happens behind lodge doors&nbsp;... | work = The Orange Order| publisher = [[Belfast Telegraph]] | date = 22 May 2007 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2568169.ece | doi = | accessdate =24 February 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> women's organisation grew up out of the Orange Order.

In the 1950s and 60s the Independents focused primarily on religious issues, especially the maintenance of Sunday as a holy day and separation of politics from religion. With the outbreak of the Troubles, [[Ian Paisley]] began regularly speaking at Independent meetings, although he was never a member. As a result, the Independent Institution has become associated with Paisley and the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Recently the relationship between the two Orange Institutions has improved, with joint church services being held. Some people believe that this will ultimately result in a healing of the split which led to the Independent Orange Institution breaking away from the mainstream Order. Like the main Order, the Independent Institution parades and holds meetings on the Twelfth of July. It is based mainly in north [[County Antrim|Antrim]].\n\n===Royal Black Institution===\n{{Main|Royal Black Institution}}\nThe Royal Black Institution was formed out of the Orange Order two years after the founding of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the requirements for membership in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order.\n\n===Apprentice Boys of Derry===\n{{Main|Apprentice Boys of Derry}}\nThe Apprentice Boys of Derry exist for their acts during the siege of Derry from James II. Although they have no formal connection with the Orange Order, the two societies have overlapping membership.\n\n==Throughout the world==\nThe Orange Order was brought to other parts of the [[English-speaking world]] by Ulster Protestant migrants and missionaries. Grand Lodges have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa.

By the time the Orange Order was formed, the United Irishmen had become a revolutionary group advocating an independent Irish republic that would \"Unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter\". United Irishmen activity was on the rise, and the government hoped to thwart it by backing the Orange Order from 1796 onward.<ref name=\"the1994\">The Cause of Ireland: From the United Irishmen to Partition, Liz Curtis, Beyond the Pale Publications, Belfast, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9514229-6-0}} pg.9</ref> [[Irish nationalist]] historians [[Thomas A.

Many Catholics supported the Act, but the Orange Order saw it as a threat to the \"Protestant constitution\" and 36 lodges in counties Armagh and Monaghan alone passed declarations opposing the Union.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/>\n\n===Suppression===\n[[File:Dollysbrae Road - geograph.org.uk - 100732.jpg|thumb|left|Dolly's Brae, site of the \"[[Dolly's Brae conflict|Battle of Dolly's Brae]]\" (1849) between Orangemen and Catholic Ribbonmen]]\nIn the early nineteenth century, Orangemen were heavily involved in violent conflict with an Irish Catholic secret society called the [[Ribbonism|Ribbonmen]]. One instance, publicised in a 7 October 1816 edition of the ''Boston Commercial Gazette'', included the murder of a Catholic priest and several members of the congregation of Dumreilly parish in [[County Cavan]] on 25 May 1816. According to the article, \"A number of Orangemen with arms rushed into the church and fired upon the congregation\".<ref>Murder in Ireland. (7 October 1816 ). Boston Commercial Gazette, http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3410213113_a106a44149_o.jpg</ref> On 19 July 1823 the Unlawful Oaths Bill was passed, banning all oath-bound societies in Ireland. This included the Orange Order, which had to be dissolved and reconstituted. In 1825 a bill banning unlawful associations \u2013 largely directed at [[Daniel O'Connell]] and his [[Catholic Association]], compelled the Orangemen once more to dissolve their association. When [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] finally granted [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, Roman Catholics were free to take seats as MPs (and take up various other positions of influence and power from which they had been excluded) and play a part in framing the laws of the land. The likelihood of Irish Catholic members holding the balance of power in the Westminster Parliament further increased the alarm of Orangemen in Ireland, as O'Connell's 'Repeal' movement aimed to bring about the restoration of a separate Irish Parliament in Dublin, which would have a Catholic majority, thereby ending to the Protestant Ascendancy. From this moment on, the Orange Order re-emerged in a new and even more militant form.<ref>Tony Gray ''The Orange Order'', Rodley Head London (1972), pp. 103\u2013106 {{ISBN|0-370-01340-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1836 the Order was accused of plotting to place [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] when [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] died; once the plot was revealed the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order.<ref>\"The Cumberland Plot\"  New Zealand Tablet, Volume XXIX, Issue 5, 31 January 1901, Page 3</ref> Under pressure from [[Joseph Hume]], [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|William Molesworth]] and [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.<ref>Murphy, James H.

This was eventually lifted after a campaign of disobedience led by [[William Johnston of Ballykilbeg]].\n\n===Revival===\nBy the late 19th century, the Order was in decline.

Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of [[Ulster]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split when [[Thomas Sloan]] left the organisation to set up the [[Independent Orange Order]]. Sloan had been suspended after running against the official unionist candidate on a pro-[[Belfast Protestant Association]] platform in the [[1902 Belfast South by-election]].\n\n===Role in the partition of Ireland===\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (130).JPG|thumb|An [[Banners in Northern Ireland|Orange banner]] showing the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date = March 2008}}\nIn 1912 the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|British House of Commons]]. However, its introduction would be delayed until 1914.

In 1913 the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], an Ulster-wide militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914, in what became known as the [[Larne gun-running]].\n\nHowever, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I]] in August 1914, which caused the Home Rule Bill to be suspended for the duration of the war. Many Orangemen served in the war with the [[36th (Ulster) Division]], suffering heavy losses, and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]; the six northeastern counties of Ulster became [[Northern Ireland]] and the other twenty-six counties became [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. This self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed in its status under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, and in its borders by the [[Boundary Commission (Ireland)|Boundary Commission]] agreement of 1925. Southern Ireland became first the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 and then in 1949 a [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]].\n\n===Since 1921===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|300px|thumb|Orangeman [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], the first [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].]]\nThe Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland.

The focus then shifted to the return leg along Garvaghy Road.<ref name=\"BBC2002\"/>\n\nEach July from 1995 to 2000, the dispute drew worldwide attention as it sparked protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, prompted a massive [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|police]]/[[British Army|army]] operation, and threatened to derail the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]].<ref name=\"BBC2002\"/><ref name=\"BBC1999\"/> The situation in Portadown was likened to a \"war zone\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/03/northernireland.stuartmillar \"Parade fervour turns country lane into war zone\"].

This led to a standoff at Drumcree between the security forces and thousands of [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]]. Following a wave of loyalist violence, the march was allowed through. In 1997, security forces locked down the Catholic area and forced the march through, citing loyalist threats. This sparked [[1997 nationalist riots in Northern Ireland|widespread protests and violence]] by Irish nationalists.

In [[County Fermanagh]], where the Catholic and Protestant populations are close to parity, membership in 1971 was three times as high as in the more Protestant counties of Antrim and Down, where it was just over 10% of adult Protestant males.<ref>http://www.sneps.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/1-Dominant-Ethnicity-demography-and-conflict_revision-Dec2010.pdf</ref> Other factors that are associated with high rates of membership are levels of unemployment that more closely match Catholic levels, and low levels of support for the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] among unionists.\n\n==Beliefs and activities==\n[[File:Orangeorder2004.jpg|thumb|Orange Order poster depicting historical and religious symbols.]]\n\n===Protestantism===\nThe basis of the modern Orange Order is the promotion and propagation of \"biblical [[Protestantism]]\" and the principles of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, [[Creed#Christians without creeds|non-creedal]] and non-[[Trinitarian]] Christians are also banned. This includes members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]], and some branches of [[Quakers]].\n\nPrevious rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"ExplainingNI\"/><ref name=\"TOM\"/> but the current rules  use the wording \"non-reformed faith\" instead. Converts to Protestantism can join by appealing to Grand Lodge.\n\n====Masonic influences====\nJames Wilson and James Sloan, who issued the warrants for the first Lodges of the Orange Order along with 'Diamond' Dan Winter, were [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]],<ref name=\"original\"/> and in the 19th century many Irish Republicans regarded the Orange Order as a [[front group]] established by Unionist Masons as a more violent and jingoist vehicle for the promotion of Unionism.<ref name=\"Cawley1993\">{{cite book|last1=Cawley|first1=Peter|editor1-last=Fideler|editor1-first=David|title=Alexandria, Volume 2|date=1993|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|page=269|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sboJPPCBpuQC&pg=PA269|accessdate=21 January 2018|chapter=The Castle of Heroes: W B Yeats Celtic Mystical Order}}</ref> Some anti-Masonic [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] groups have claimed that the Orange Order is still influenced by freemasonry.<ref>{{cite web | title = Inside the Hidden World of Secret Societies | publisher = Evangelical Truth | url = http://www.evangelicaltruth.com/}} (An example)</ref> Many Masonic traditions survive, such as the organisation of the Order into lodges. The Order has a similar system of degrees through which new members advance. These degrees are interactive plays with references to the Bible.

When [[the Twelfth|the Twelfth of July]] falls on a Sunday the parades traditionally held on that date are held the next day instead. In March 2002, the Order threatened \"to take every action necessary, regardless of the consequences\" to prevent the [[Ballymena]] Show being held on a Sunday.<ref name=\"c02\">{{cite web | title = A Draft Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 2002 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch02.htm | publisher = CAIN | accessdate =9 February 2008}}</ref> The [[County Antrim]] Agricultural Association complied with the Order's wishes.<ref name=\"c02\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nThe Orange Order is strongly linked to [[British unionism]].<ref>Tonge, Johnathan.

Due to its close links with the UUP, the Orange Order was able to exert great influence. The Order was the force behind the UUP no-confidence votes in reformist [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Ministers]] [[Terence O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of the Maine|Terence O'Neill]] (1969), [[James Chichester-Clark]] (1969\u201371), and [[Brian Faulkner]] (1972\u201374).<ref name=\"orange\"/> At the outbreak of [[The Troubles]] in 1969, the Order encouraged its members to join the Northern Ireland security forces.<ref name=\"portadowntimesapril07\"/> The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) attracted the most seats in an election for the first time in 2003.

[[Mortimer O'Sullivan]], a converted Roman Catholic, was a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland. In the 1950s, Scotland also had a former Roman Catholic as a Grand Chaplain, the Rev. William McDermott.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Orange Institution in Ireland has the structure of a pyramid. At its base are about 1400 private lodges; every Orangeman belongs to a private lodge. Each private lodge sends six representatives to the district lodge, of which there are 126. Depending on size, each district lodge sends seven to thirteen representatives to the county lodge, of which there are 12. Each of these sends representatives to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which heads the Orange Order.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Ireland has 373 members. As a result, much of the real power in the Order resides in the Central Committee of the Grand Lodge, which is made up of three members from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland (Down, Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh) as well as the two other County Lodges in Northern Ireland, the City of Belfast Grand Lodge and the City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge, two each from the remaining Ulster counties (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan), one from Leitrim, and 19 others. There are other committees of the Grand Lodge, including rules revision, finance, and education.\n\nDespite this hierarchy, private lodges are basically autonomous as long as they generally obey the rules of the Institution. Breaking these can lead to suspension of the lodge's warrant \u2013 essentially the dissolution of the lodge \u2013 by the Grand Lodge, but this rarely occurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Private lodges may disobey policies laid down by senior lodges without consequence. For example, several lodges have failed to expel members convicted of murder despite a rule stating that anyone convicted of a serious crime should be expelled,<ref>Peter Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London, 1999, pp.151\u20132.</ref> and [[Portadown]] lodges have negotiated with the [[Parades Commission]] in defiance of Grand Lodge policy that the Commission should not be acknowledged.\n\nPrivate lodges wishing to change Orange Order rules or policy can submit a resolution to their district lodge, which may submit it upwards until it eventually reaches the Grand Lodge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAll Lodge meetings commence with the reading of the Bible and prayers that non-practising Protestants, Roman Catholics and people of other faiths and none, 'may become wise unto salvation' (which is direct quote from 2 Timothy 3:15 in the Bible).<ref>Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Resolutions 2011, http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/press/Orange-Standard/2011-Standard/1107-Julyl2011/article2.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n| title        = So What Really Happens Behind Lodge Doors\n| url          = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/so-what-really-happens-behind-lodge-doors-13443749.html\n| newspaper    = Belfast Telegraph\n| location     = \n| date         = \n| access-date  =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Related organisations==\n[[File:Orange marcher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Orangewoman marching in an Orange Order parade in [[Glasgow]].]]\n\n===Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland===\nA distinct<ref name=\"MJess\">{{cite web | last = Jess | first = Mervyn | title = So, what really happens behind lodge doors&nbsp;... | work = The Orange Order| publisher = [[Belfast Telegraph]] | date = 22 May 2007 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2568169.ece | doi = | accessdate =24 February 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> women's organisation grew up out of the Orange Order.

In the 1950s and 60s the Independents focused primarily on religious issues, especially the maintenance of Sunday as a holy day and separation of politics from religion. With the outbreak of the Troubles, [[Ian Paisley]] began regularly speaking at Independent meetings, although he was never a member. As a result, the Independent Institution has become associated with Paisley and the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Recently the relationship between the two Orange Institutions has improved, with joint church services being held. Some people believe that this will ultimately result in a healing of the split which led to the Independent Orange Institution breaking away from the mainstream Order. Like the main Order, the Independent Institution parades and holds meetings on the Twelfth of July. It is based mainly in north [[County Antrim|Antrim]].\n\n===Royal Black Institution===\n{{Main|Royal Black Institution}}\nThe Royal Black Institution was formed out of the Orange Order two years after the founding of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the requirements for membership in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order.\n\n===Apprentice Boys of Derry===\n{{Main|Apprentice Boys of Derry}}\nThe Apprentice Boys of Derry exist for their acts during the siege of Derry from James II. Although they have no formal connection with the Orange Order, the two societies have overlapping membership.\n\n==Throughout the world==\nThe Orange Order was brought to other parts of the [[English-speaking world]] by Ulster Protestant migrants and missionaries. Grand Lodges have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa.
