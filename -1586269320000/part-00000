What under Spanish rule was called [[The Californias|the Province of the Californias]] (1768\u20131804), which stretched almost {{convert|2000|miles|km}} from north to south, was divided into [[Alta California]] (Upper California) and [[Baja California]] (Lower California) in 1804 at the line separating the [[Franciscan]] missions in the north from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missions in the south.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] lasting from 1846 to 1848, Alta California was admitted to the United States as the present-day State of California. Baja California remained under [[Mexico|Mexican]] rule.  It was subsequently divided into two Mexican states. \n\nIn 1888, under the government of President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], Baja California became a federally administered territory called the North Territory of Baja California (\"north territory\" because it was the northernmost territory in the Republic of Mexico). In 1952, the northern portion of this territory (above 28\u00b0N) became the 29th state of Mexico, called Baja California; the sparsely populated southern portion remained a federally administered territory. In 1974, it became the 31st state of Mexico, admitted as [[Baja California Sur]].\n\n==History of partition movements==\n\n===Pre-statehood===\n{{main article|Compromise of 1850}}\nThe territory that became the present state of California was acquired by the U.S. as a result of American victory in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and subsequent 1848 [[Mexican Cession]]. After the war, a confrontation erupted between the [[slave state]]s of the South and the [[Free state (USA)|free states]] of the North regarding the status of these acquired territories. Among the disputes, the South wanted to extend the [[Missouri Compromise]] line ([[36\u00b030' parallel north]]), and thus slave territory, west to [[Southern California]] and to the Pacific coast, while the North did not.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDp6AAAAMAAJ|author=Mark J.

Baja California remained under [[Mexico|Mexican]] rule.

In 1952, the northern portion of this territory (above 28\u00b0N) became the 29th state of Mexico, called Baja California; the sparsely populated southern portion remained a federally administered territory.

At the time, Babylonia was the last major power in western Asia that was not yet under Persian control. The battle was fought in or near the strategic riverside city of [[Opis]], north of the capital [[Babylon]]. It resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians. A few days later, the city of [[Sippar]] surrendered to the Persians and Cyrus's forces entered Babylon apparently without a fight. Cyrus was subsequently proclaimed king of Babylonia and its subject territories, thus ending the independence of Babylon and incorporating the Babylonian Empire into the greater Persian Empire.\n\n==Location==\nThe site of the battle was at the city of [[Opis]] on the river [[Tigris]], located about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) north of modern [[Baghdad]]. The city is thought to have been a preferred point to cross the river; [[Xenophon]] describes a bridge there.<ref name=\"Oppenheim\">Oppenheim, A.L. \"The Babylonian Evidence of Achaemenian Rule in Mesopotamia\", in ''The Cambridge History of Iran'' vol. 2, p. 539.

Some additional detail is provided by one of the few documents to have survived from Cyrus's lifetime, the [[Cyrus Cylinder]]. Further information on Cyrus's campaign is provided by the later [[ancient Greek]] writers [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], though neither mention the battle at Opis and their accounts of the campaign differ considerably from the Persian and Babylonian sources. Most scholars prefer to use the Nabonidus Chronicle as the main source on the battle, as it is a contemporaneous source.<ref name=\"Dandamaev\">Dandamaev, MA; Vogelsang, WJ (trans.).

It provides very little information about Cyrus's activities in the years immediately preceding the battle. The chronicler focuses on events of immediate relevance to Babylonia and its rulers, only occasionally records events outside Babylonia and does not provide much detail other than a bare outline of key incidents. There is almost no information for the period 547\u2013539. Most of the chronicle's text for this period is illegible, making it impossible to assess the significance of the few words that can be read.<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Babylonia\">Kuhrt, Am\u00e9lie. \"Babylonia from Cyrus to Xerxes\", in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: Vol IV \u2013 Persia, Greece and the Western Mediterranean'', pp. 112\u2013138.

Its power had grown enormously under its king, Cyrus II, who had conquered a huge swathe of territory to create an empire that covered an area corresponding to the modern countries of [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The only remaining significant unconquered power in the Near East was the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which controlled Mesopotamia and subject kingdoms such as [[Syria]], [[Judea]], [[Phoenicia]] and parts of [[Arabia]]. It had been closely linked with Cyrus's enemies elsewhere. The empire was previously an ally of [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], whose kingdom was overrun by the Persians a few years prior to the invasion of Babylonia.<ref name=\"Briant-2\">Briant, Pierre. ''From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire'', pp 40\u201343.

The Nabonidus Chronicle states that following the battle, \"on the fourteenth day [6 October] [[Sippar]] was captured without battle.

''Who's who in the Ancient Near East'', p. 112. Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-13230-4}}</ref> Persian troops took control of the city, though the Nabonidus Chronicle provides little detail of how this was done. The chronicle makes a point of noting the conquering army's protection of the city's most important temples and records that \"Interruption of (rites/cults) in [the] [[Esagila]] [temple] or the [other] temples there was none, and no date was missed.\" Seventeen days later, on 29 October, Cyrus himself entered Babylon, where he was proclaimed king, issued royal proclamations and appointed governors of his newly conquered realm.<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Corpus\" />\n\nAncient Greek accounts of Cyrus's campaign and the fall of Babylon differ significantly from the cuneiform accounts preserved in the Nabonidus Chronicle and the Cyrus Cylinder, suggesting that the Greeks were drawing on\u2014or perhaps inventing\u2014different traditions about the conquest of Babylonia. The two ancient Greek sources for the campaign, Herodotus and Xenophon, present broadly similar versions of events. According to Herodotus, Cyrus marched to Babylon along the side of the Diyala river (past Opis, though the battle is not mentioned), where the Persians fought a battle with the Babylonians near the capital. Cyrus subsequently laid siege to Babylon, ordering his troops to dig a canal to drain off part of the Euphrates to enable his troops to penetrate the city through weak points in its defences. Xenophon provides a similar but more elaborate account, claiming that Cyrus dug a huge trench around the city to divert the Euphrates and make the river bed passable for the Persian army. Herodotus, Xenophon and the Biblical [[Book of Daniel]] all assert that the Babylonians were taken by surprise while celebrating a festival.<ref name=\"Beaulieu\">[[Paul-Alain Beaulieu|Beaulieu, Paul-Alain]]. ''The Reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon, 556-539 B.C.'', p. 226. Yale University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-300-04314-7}}</ref>\n\nBerossus presents an account that is different again, asserting that Cyrus defeated Nabonidus, who \"fled with certain others and shut himself up in [[Borsippa]]. Meanwhile Cyrus occupied Babylon and ordered to destroy the exterior walls of the city, because the city seemed very formidable to him and difficult to capture. Afterward Cyrus marched to Borsippa, in order to organize the siege against Nabonidus. But Nabonidus did not await the end of the siege, and surrendered.\"<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" />\n\nThese accounts, written long after the Persian conquest, contradict many aspects of the contemporary cuneiform evidence, which does not mention any sieges, engineering works or battles near Babylon. The cuneiform descriptions of a peaceful surrender of Babylon are corroborated by archaeological evidence from the city, as no evidence of conflagrations or destruction have been found in the layers corresponding to the fall of the city to the Persians.<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" /> Scholars are in general agreement that Herodotus's account is an invention,<ref>Campbell, Duncan B.; Hook, Adam. ''Ancient Siege Warfare: Persians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans 546\u2013146 BC'', p. 9. Osprey Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84176-770-0}}</ref> while Kuhrt comments that Xenophon's account in his ''[[Cyropedia]]'' is \"virtually impossible to use ... as a strictly historical source\" due to its literary form, as a moral treatise on Cyrus in the form of an historical novella.<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Babylonia\" /> [[Paul-Alain Beaulieu]] suggests that the Greek accounts may constitute an aggregate of various folk tales and legends which came to be associated with the fall of Babylon.\"<ref name=\"Beaulieu\" /> [[David George Hogarth]] and [[Samuel Rolles Driver]] comment on what they saw as Herodotus's unreliability:\n\n{{quote|The untrustworthiness of the accounts in Herodotus is evident as soon as they can be definitely compared with monumental records. The famous siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus is contradicted by his inscription, which relates that, after a battle at Opis and another at Sippara, his general, Gobryas, entered the city without a struggle. Babylon had stood many sieges before the time of Cyrus, and stood many more afterwards : it is thought that one of the two captures by [[Darius the Great|Darius]], whose general was also named Gobryas, may have been confused with the entry of Cyrus.<ref>Hogarth, David George; Driver, Samuel Rolles. ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane'', p. 202. Ayer Publishing, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8369-5771-7}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[Behistun Inscription]], Babylon revolted twice against Darius, and was recaptured on the second occasion by his general Gobryas. Herodotus only mentions the first revolt of Babylon in which Zopyrus captured the city for Darius, and omits this second revolt.<ref>Dewald, Carolyn; John, Marincola; ''The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus'', Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 279. {{ISBN|0-521-83001-X}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThe Babylonian defeat at Opis and the apparently unopposed Persian entry into Babylon ended the independence of Babylonia (although there were a number of unsuccessful revolts against later Persian rulers). That the Babylonian collapse was swift and apparently total is confirmed by the ancient accounts of Cyrus's campaign in Mesopotamia and corroborating evidence such as cuneiform inscriptions dating to shortly after the Persian conquest. A number of explanations have been advanced for the rapid collapse of the Babylonian state. The Cyrus Cylinder and the roughly contemporary [[Verse Account of Nabonidus]] attribute Nabonidus's failure to the desire of the god [[Marduk]] to punish a regime that had opposed his will. The strongly anti-Nabonidus tone of these documents, which accused the former king of behaving capriciously and neglecting the worship of the gods, suggests that their authors \u2013 the Babylonian priestly elite \u2013 were alienated from Nabonidus and may have welcomed a Persian takeover. It is, however, unclear how widely the Persians were supported within Babylonia, as accounts of the invasion and Nabonidus's rule are coloured by Cyrus's subsequent propaganda.<ref>McIntosh, Jane. ''Ancient Mesopotamia'', pp. 113\u201314. ABC-CLIO, 2005. {{ISBN|1-57607-965-1}}</ref>\n\nOther writers have advanced a number of additional or alternative explanations for the Babylonian defeat. M. A. Dandamaev suggests variously that the regime suffered from a lack of allies; a lack of support among the general population; opposition from subject peoples such as the Jews, who may have seen the invading Persians as liberators; and the inability of the Babylonian forces to resist numerically superior and better equipped opponents.<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}{{Achaemenid Empire}}{{Cyrus the Great}}\n\n[[Category:539 BC]]\n[[Category:6th-century BC conflicts|Opis]]\n[[Category:6th century BC]]\n[[Category:Battles of Cyrus the Great]]\n[[Category:Nabonidus]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict=Battle of Opis\n|partof=the [[Wars of Cyrus the Great|Campaigns of Cyrus the Great]]\n|image= \n|caption=\n|map_type = West Asia\n|map_relief = yes\n|coordinates = {{Coord|33|10|53|N|44|42|00|E|region:GR_type:event|display=inline,title}}\n|map_size = 300\n|map_marksize = 7\n|map_caption = Approximate location of the Battle of Opis\n|map_label   =Battle of Opis\n|date=September 25 \u2013 September 28?, 539 BC\n|place=[[Opis]], [[Babylonia]]\n|result=Decisive [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] victory.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=EjhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212&dq=battle+of+opis+decisive+persian+victory&source=bl&ots=X5PXq29z06&sig=BKhpTTD8JN3H8nxpFF5KFNXda-s&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNt53xx_vaAhXCDewKHTwLDEgQ6AEIazAM#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20opis%20decisive%20persian%20victory&f=false/ Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550\u2013330 BCE] : page 212</ref><ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=Krh7n9AyS40C&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=battle+of+opis+decisive+persian+victory&source=bl&ots=_5ePrZOEZi&sig=jic7ooEjQHxOp_cPBkp6bnmm8bo&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhhpe2xvvaAhUGkRQKHXJVDQwQ6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20opis%20decisive%20persian%20victory&f=false/ HSC Ancient History] : page 82</ref>\n|territory=Neo-Babylonian Empire annexed by Persia.\n|combatant1=[[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]\n|combatant2=[[Achaemenid|Achaemenid Empire]]\n|commander1=[[Nabonidus]] of [[Babylonia]],<br>[[Belshazzar]]{{KIA}}\n|commander2=[[Cyrus the Great]],<br>[[Gobryas]] of [[Gutium]],<br>[[Pantea Arteshbod]],<br>[[Aryasb]]<ref>http://www.persepolis.nu/queens.htm#pantea</ref>,<br> unknown others\n|strength1=\n|strength2=\n|casualties1=Heavy?<ref>Boardman, John \"Nabonidus: Babylonia from 605\u2013539 B.C.\", in ''The Cambridge Ancient History'' vol. 3.2, p. 249.

At the time, Babylonia was the last major power in western Asia that was not yet under Persian control. The battle was fought in or near the strategic riverside city of [[Opis]], north of the capital [[Babylon]]. It resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians. A few days later, the city of [[Sippar]] surrendered to the Persians and Cyrus's forces entered Babylon apparently without a fight. Cyrus was subsequently proclaimed king of Babylonia and its subject territories, thus ending the independence of Babylon and incorporating the Babylonian Empire into the greater Persian Empire.\n\n==Location==\nThe site of the battle was at the city of [[Opis]] on the river [[Tigris]], located about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) north of modern [[Baghdad]].

Further information on Cyrus's campaign is provided by the later [[ancient Greek]] writers [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], though neither mention the battle at Opis and their accounts of the campaign differ considerably from the Persian and Babylonian sources.

The only remaining significant unconquered power in the Near East was the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which controlled Mesopotamia and subject kingdoms such as [[Syria]], [[Judea]], [[Phoenicia]] and parts of [[Arabia]].

However, the battle demonstrates that the existing Babylonian regime actively resisted Cyrus's invasion of Mesopotamia.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe defeat at Opis appears to have ended any serious resistance to the Persian invasion. The Nabonidus Chronicle states that following the battle, \"on the fourteenth day [6 October] [[Sippar]] was captured without battle. Nabonidus fled.\"<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Corpus\" /> The chronicle's wording implies that Nabonidus was present in Sippar when the Persians arrived.<ref>Vanderhooft, David. \"Cyrus II, Liberator or Conqueror?

''Who's who in the Ancient Near East'', p. 112. Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-13230-4}}</ref> Persian troops took control of the city, though the Nabonidus Chronicle provides little detail of how this was done. The chronicle makes a point of noting the conquering army's protection of the city's most important temples and records that \"Interruption of (rites/cults) in [the] [[Esagila]] [temple] or the [other] temples there was none, and no date was missed.\" Seventeen days later, on 29 October, Cyrus himself entered Babylon, where he was proclaimed king, issued royal proclamations and appointed governors of his newly conquered realm.<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Corpus\" />\n\nAncient Greek accounts of Cyrus's campaign and the fall of Babylon differ significantly from the cuneiform accounts preserved in the Nabonidus Chronicle and the Cyrus Cylinder, suggesting that the Greeks were drawing on\u2014or perhaps inventing\u2014different traditions about the conquest of Babylonia. The two ancient Greek sources for the campaign, Herodotus and Xenophon, present broadly similar versions of events. According to Herodotus, Cyrus marched to Babylon along the side of the Diyala river (past Opis, though the battle is not mentioned), where the Persians fought a battle with the Babylonians near the capital. Cyrus subsequently laid siege to Babylon, ordering his troops to dig a canal to drain off part of the Euphrates to enable his troops to penetrate the city through weak points in its defences. Xenophon provides a similar but more elaborate account, claiming that Cyrus dug a huge trench around the city to divert the Euphrates and make the river bed passable for the Persian army. Herodotus, Xenophon and the Biblical [[Book of Daniel]] all assert that the Babylonians were taken by surprise while celebrating a festival.<ref name=\"Beaulieu\">[[Paul-Alain Beaulieu|Beaulieu, Paul-Alain]]. ''The Reign of Nabonidus, King of Babylon, 556-539 B.C.'', p. 226. Yale University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-300-04314-7}}</ref>\n\nBerossus presents an account that is different again, asserting that Cyrus defeated Nabonidus, who \"fled with certain others and shut himself up in [[Borsippa]]. Meanwhile Cyrus occupied Babylon and ordered to destroy the exterior walls of the city, because the city seemed very formidable to him and difficult to capture. Afterward Cyrus marched to Borsippa, in order to organize the siege against Nabonidus. But Nabonidus did not await the end of the siege, and surrendered.\"<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" />\n\nThese accounts, written long after the Persian conquest, contradict many aspects of the contemporary cuneiform evidence, which does not mention any sieges, engineering works or battles near Babylon. The cuneiform descriptions of a peaceful surrender of Babylon are corroborated by archaeological evidence from the city, as no evidence of conflagrations or destruction have been found in the layers corresponding to the fall of the city to the Persians.<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" /> Scholars are in general agreement that Herodotus's account is an invention,<ref>Campbell, Duncan B.; Hook, Adam. ''Ancient Siege Warfare: Persians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans 546\u2013146 BC'', p. 9. Osprey Publishing, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84176-770-0}}</ref> while Kuhrt comments that Xenophon's account in his ''[[Cyropedia]]'' is \"virtually impossible to use ... as a strictly historical source\" due to its literary form, as a moral treatise on Cyrus in the form of an historical novella.<ref name=\"Kuhrt-Babylonia\" /> [[Paul-Alain Beaulieu]] suggests that the Greek accounts may constitute an aggregate of various folk tales and legends which came to be associated with the fall of Babylon.\"<ref name=\"Beaulieu\" /> [[David George Hogarth]] and [[Samuel Rolles Driver]] comment on what they saw as Herodotus's unreliability:\n\n{{quote|The untrustworthiness of the accounts in Herodotus is evident as soon as they can be definitely compared with monumental records. The famous siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus is contradicted by his inscription, which relates that, after a battle at Opis and another at Sippara, his general, Gobryas, entered the city without a struggle. Babylon had stood many sieges before the time of Cyrus, and stood many more afterwards : it is thought that one of the two captures by [[Darius the Great|Darius]], whose general was also named Gobryas, may have been confused with the entry of Cyrus.<ref>Hogarth, David George; Driver, Samuel Rolles. ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane'', p. 202. Ayer Publishing, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8369-5771-7}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[Behistun Inscription]], Babylon revolted twice against Darius, and was recaptured on the second occasion by his general Gobryas. Herodotus only mentions the first revolt of Babylon in which Zopyrus captured the city for Darius, and omits this second revolt.<ref>Dewald, Carolyn; John, Marincola; ''The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus'', Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 279. {{ISBN|0-521-83001-X}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nThe Babylonian defeat at Opis and the apparently unopposed Persian entry into Babylon ended the independence of Babylonia (although there were a number of unsuccessful revolts against later Persian rulers). That the Babylonian collapse was swift and apparently total is confirmed by the ancient accounts of Cyrus's campaign in Mesopotamia and corroborating evidence such as cuneiform inscriptions dating to shortly after the Persian conquest. A number of explanations have been advanced for the rapid collapse of the Babylonian state. The Cyrus Cylinder and the roughly contemporary [[Verse Account of Nabonidus]] attribute Nabonidus's failure to the desire of the god [[Marduk]] to punish a regime that had opposed his will. The strongly anti-Nabonidus tone of these documents, which accused the former king of behaving capriciously and neglecting the worship of the gods, suggests that their authors \u2013 the Babylonian priestly elite \u2013 were alienated from Nabonidus and may have welcomed a Persian takeover. It is, however, unclear how widely the Persians were supported within Babylonia, as accounts of the invasion and Nabonidus's rule are coloured by Cyrus's subsequent propaganda.<ref>McIntosh, Jane. ''Ancient Mesopotamia'', pp. 113\u201314. ABC-CLIO, 2005. {{ISBN|1-57607-965-1}}</ref>\n\nOther writers have advanced a number of additional or alternative explanations for the Babylonian defeat. M. A. Dandamaev suggests variously that the regime suffered from a lack of allies; a lack of support among the general population; opposition from subject peoples such as the Jews, who may have seen the invading Persians as liberators; and the inability of the Babylonian forces to resist numerically superior and better equipped opponents.<ref name=\"Dandamaev\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}{{Achaemenid Empire}}{{Cyrus the Great}}\n\n[[Category:539 BC]]\n[[Category:6th-century BC conflicts|Opis]]\n[[Category:6th century BC]]\n[[Category:Battles of Cyrus the Great]]\n[[Category:Nabonidus]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 547-539 \u2192 547\u2013539", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Opis"}

The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its [[peak load]] as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

Wreck Cove makes up half of that hydro capacity, making it a key provider of reliable, renewable energy needed to complement and back up the 600 MW of clean \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 [[wind power]] on the province's electrical system. The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its [[peak load]] as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].
