PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.\n\nPTFE is used as a [[non-stick coating]] for pans and other cookware. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Happy Pan Poster.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the Happy Pan, a Teflon-coated pan from the 1960s]]\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/teflon \"From stove tops to outer space...

As Plunkett attempted to make a new [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerant, the [[tetrafluoroethylene]] gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling \"empty.\" Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart.

PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores.

Several peer reviewed studies have shown that the mean and median concentration of PFOA in household dust in the US was found to be between approximately 10,000 and 50,000 parts per trillion (ppt)3. These studies highlight the fact that there is significantly more PFOA in the ambient dust in the average home than the levels currently being discussed as thresholds for drinking water.

Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.

Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes it the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker and lower-melting-point [[polyethylene]] commonly used in low-cost applications.\n\nIn industrial applications, owing to its low friction, PTFE is used for [[plain bearing]]s, [[gear]]s, [[slide plate]]s, seals, gaskets, bushings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espemfg.com/teflon-machining-fabrication.html|title=Teflon Machining & Fabrication {{!}} ESPE|website=www.espemfg.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]] and [[nylon]].<ref>Mishra & Yagci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC&pg=PA573 p 573]</ref>\n \nIts extremely high bulk [[resistivity]] makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life [[electret]]s, the [[electrostatic]] analogues of [[magnet|permanent magnets]].\n\nPTFE film is also widely used in the production of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores.

It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.\n\n[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]\n\nThe sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).<ref>[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers \u00e0 repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide range of wavelengths, from UV down to near [[infrared]]. In this region, the ratio of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] (PTFE sheet) radiates like [[Lambert's cosine law]].

However, there has been relatively little conversation about the presence of these chemicals in our everyday lives and the public\u2019s sheer exposure to PFAS through primary contact from commercial products used in our everyday lives. Several peer reviewed studies have shown that the mean and median concentration of PFOA in household dust in the US was found to be between approximately 10,000 and 50,000 parts per trillion (ppt)3.
