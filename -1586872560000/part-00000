As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods, however they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=\"ref10\"/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=\"ref12\">{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=\"ref10\">{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

The evidence suggests that the two species on the North and South (including Stewart) Islands of New Zealand began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and the two South Island subspecies began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter. Fossils of New Zealand robins can sometimes be found near pit fall deposits, as they do most of their feeding/foraging on the ground.<ref name=\"ref5\">{{cite book|last1=Worthy|first1=Trevor H.|last2=Holdaway|first2=Richard N.|year=2002|chapter=Shorebirds, Parrots and Passerines|title=The Lost World of the Moa|pages=410\u2013440}}</ref> The fossil record also indicates the robins' presence throughout lowland New Zealand until drastic habitat reduction through deforestation by the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestors of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and later European colonisers.<ref name=\"ref6\">{{cite journal|last=Borkin|first=K.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=\"ref4\">{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=\"ref9\"/> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=\"ref8\"/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=\"ref16\">{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', April 22, 2013.</ref> His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms, such as the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]]. Prior to his political career, he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal. He later ran for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] and won in a landslide in the [[1984 Canadian federal election]], defeating [[John Turner]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and [[Ed Broadbent]] of the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since [[1958 Canadian federal election|1958]] and increasing his party's seats by 111, up to 211 seats, the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history. The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the [[2015 Canadian federal election|Liberals' victory in 2015]]. Throughout his political career, Mulroney's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nHe brought forth a constitutional reform, the [[Meech Lake Accord]], in 1987, meant to persuade the government of [[Quebec]] to endorse the [[Constitution Act, 1982|1982 constitutional amendments]]. It was not ratified by the provincial governments of [[Manitoba]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] before the June ratification deadline, and thus met its demise in 1990. This loss led to another round of meetings in [[Charlottetown]] in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the [[Charlottetown Accord]], which would create extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\">Blake, ed., ''Transforming the Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney'' (2007)</ref> The end of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 created division in the country and sparked a revival of [[Quebec separatism]], culminating in the creation and rise of the [[Bloc Quebecois]] (BQ).<ref name=\"Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22\">Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Mulroney opposed the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa and he met with many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure. His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. He led the Western response to the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]], to strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the US and Britain to follow suit almost immediately \u2014 an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time in a country that had previously been isolated by Western governments. The Mulroney government was also strongly against the U.S. [[Sandinista#Sandinistas vs. Contras|intervention]] in Nicaragua under Reagan, and accepted [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries with repressive regimes that were supported by the [[Reagan administration]]. On December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first term, the [[Air India Flight 182]] bombing occurred. This was the largest terrorist act of the time, with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadians. There were several warnings from the [[Indian government]] to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights, which raised questions as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.<ref name=\"story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=90d8bfad-8bd6-43d6-9899-ad8f0649db87&k=79609 |title=story |publisher=Canada.com |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109115600/https://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=90d8bfad-8bd6-43d6-9899-ad8f0649db87&k=79609 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"ctv story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060925/airindia_inquiry_060925/20060925?hub=TopStories |title=ctv story |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206080041/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060925/airindia_inquiry_060925/20060925?hub=TopStories |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=The Canadian Press|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/11/07/air-india.html|title=CBC website November 7, 2007|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the environment, Mulroney made it a key focus of his government, and moved Canada to become the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention, which were agreed to at the United Nations Conference on the Environment. His government added significant new national parks ([[Bruce Peninsula National Park|Bruce Peninsula]], [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|South Moresby]], and [[Grasslands National Park|Grasslands]]) and passed the ''[[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]'' and the ''[[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/> In response to the decline of [[cod]] in Atlantic Canada, the Mulroney government imposed a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the cod fishery there, putting an end to a large portion of the Newfoundland fishing industry. This caused rising economic hardship. His government instituted various programs designed to mitigate these problems, but still started to become deeply unpopular in the Atlantic provinces.\n\nOn social issues, Mulroney opposed capital punishment<ref name=\"Newman427\" /> and attempted a compromise on [[abortion in Canada|abortion]], to the dismay of [[social conservative]]s.<ref name=\"Donaldson, p. 356\">Donaldson, p. 356.</ref>\n\nMulroney's second term was marked by an economic recession. He proposed the introduction of a national [[sales tax]], the Goods and Services Tax (GST). When it was introduced in 1991, it replaced the Manufacturers' Sales Tax (MST), which was previously applied to goods manufactured in Canada. This was contentious among the Senate, and public polling showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to it. Mulroney then used Section 26, a Constitutional provision, to allow him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators. Although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney's use of an \"emergency\" clause in the constitution.<ref name=\"Raymond B. Blake 2007\">Raymond B. Blake, ed., ''Transforming the Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney'' (2007)</ref> [[Fiscal conservative]]s likewise did not approve of Mulroney's tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of \"[[big government]]\" programs and political [[patronage]]. This caused a stark decline in Mulroney's popularity, which induced him to resign and hand over his power to [[Kim Campbell]], who became the 19th Prime Minister of Canada on June 25, 1993.\n\nBrian Mulroney is also particularly famous for delivering one of the few \"knockout blows\" in Canadian debate history by commenting \"[[You had an option, sir]]\" over John Turner's appointments. Turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney,<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /> and only could repeat \"I had no option.\" A visibly angry Mulroney then called this \"an avowal of failure\" and \"a confession of non-leadership\".\n\nMulroney's legacy is complicated and even emotional. Mulroney makes the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication.<ref name=\"Newman, p. 361\">Newman, p. 361.</ref> His Deputy Prime Minister [[Don Mazankowski]] made a claim that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, \"Dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\" Military historians [[Norman Hillmer]] and [[J.L. Granatstein]] ranked Mulroney eighth among Canada's prime ministers in their 1999 book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders''. Former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader [[Michel Gauthier]] considered Brian Mulroney to be the greatest prime minister Canada has known in the last 50 years due to its political projects taken by him such as Meech Lake accord, the fight against apartheid, an economic project, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a fiscal project, which was to put the finances of the state back in order, and also pointed out that there was no constitutional quarrel between the federal and Quebec Government.<ref name=\"lapresse.ca\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201805/11/01-5181588-michel-gauthier-se-joint-aux-conservateurs.php|title=Michel Gauthier se joint aux conservateurs|date=May 12, 2018|website=La Presse|language=fr|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref> In 2006, he was proclaimed Canada\u2019s greenest prime minister by a survey of environmentalists, due to his efforts such as the Canada-U.S. acid rain treaty, an ambitious environmental agenda, the creation of eight new national parks, and the ratification of the Environmental Protection Act.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mulroney-honoured-for-environmental-record-1.616580</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMulroney was born on March 20, 1939, in [[Baie-Comeau, Quebec]], a remote and isolated town in the eastern part of the province.

Lapham III, and twins Pierce Lapham and Elizabeth Theodora Lapham, and Miranda Brooke Lapham from daughter, Caroline; and twins Brian Gerald Alexander and John Benedict Dimitri and daughter Isabel Veronica (known as Ivy) by son Ben and his wife [[Jessica Mulroney|Jessica]]. The twins served as page boys and train bearers at the [[wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle]] on May 19, 2018, which their parents also attended, and their sister was one of the bridesmaids.\n\n==Education==\nMulroney entered [[St. Francis Xavier University]] in the fall of 1955 as a 16-year-old freshman. His political life began when he was recruited to the campus Progressive Conservative group by [[Lowell Murray]] and others, early in his first year. Murray would become a close friend, mentor, and adviser who was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]] in 1979. Other important, lasting friendships made there by Mulroney included [[Gerald Doucet]], [[Fred Doucet]], [[Sam Wakim]], and [[Patrick MacAdam]]. Mulroney enthusiastically embraced political organization, and assisted the local PC candidate in his successful 1956 Nova Scotia provincial election campaign; the PCs, led provincially by [[Robert Stanfield]], swept to a surprise victory.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMulroney became a youth delegate and attended the 1956 leadership convention in [[Ottawa]]. While initially undecided, Mulroney was captivated by [[John Diefenbaker]]'s powerful oratory and easy approachability. Mulroney joined the \"Youth for Diefenbaker\" committee which was led by [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], a future [[kinship|scion]] of Canadian business. Mulroney struck an early friendship with Diefenbaker (who won the leadership) and received telephone calls from him.<ref name=\"Donaldson310\"/>\n\nMulroney won several public speaking contests at St. Francis Xavier University, was a star member of the school's [[debating]] team, and never lost an interuniversity debate. He was also very active in campus politics, serving with distinction in several [[Model Parliament]]s, and was campus prime minister in a [[Maritimes]]-wide Model Parliament in 1958.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMulroney also assisted with the 1958 national election campaign at the local level in Nova Scotia; a campaign that led to the largest majority in Canadian history.<ref>''The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], 1991</ref> After graduating from St. Francis Xavier with a degree in political science in 1959, Mulroney at first pursued a law degree from [[Dalhousie Law School]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. It was around this time that Mulroney also cultivated friendships with the Tory premier of Nova Scotia, Robert Stanfield, and his chief adviser [[Dalton Camp]]. In his role as an 'advance man', Mulroney significantly assisted with Stanfield's successful 1960 re-election campaign. Mulroney neglected his studies, then fell seriously ill during the winter term, was hospitalized, and, despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness, left his program at Dalhousie after the first year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He then applied to [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in Quebec City, and restarted first-year law there the next year.\n\nIn [[Quebec City]], Mulroney befriended future Quebec [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Daniel Johnson, Sr]], and frequented the provincial legislature, making connections with politicians, aides, and journalists. At Laval, Mulroney built a network of friends, including [[Lucien Bouchard]], [[Bernard Roy]], [[Michel Cogger]], [[Michael Meighen]], and [[Jean Bazin]], that would play a prominent role in Canadian politics for years to come.<ref>H. Graham Rawlinson and [[J.L. Granatstein]], ''The Canadian 100: The 100 Most Influential Canadians of the 20th century,'' Toronto: McArthur & Company, 1997, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> During this time, Mulroney was still involved in the Conservative youth wing and was acquainted with the President of the Student Federation, [[Joe Clark]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nMulroney secured a plum temporary appointment in Ottawa during the summer of 1962, as the executive assistant to [[Alvin Hamilton]], minister of agriculture. Then a federal election was called, and Prime Minister Diefenbaker appointed Hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign. Hamilton took Mulroney with him on the campaign trail, where the young organizer gained valuable experience.<ref>''The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], 1991, pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Builds reputation, gains publicity==\nAfter graduating from Laval in 1964, Mulroney joined the [[Montreal]] law firm now known as [[Norton Rose Fulbright]], which at the time was the largest law firm in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Mulroney twice failed his bar exams, but the firm kept him due to his charming personality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> After ultimately passing his bar exams, Mulroney was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1965, and became a labour lawyer, which was then a new and exciting field of law in Quebec. Mulroney's superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation, with opponents often polarized and at odds, proved ideal for this field. He was noted for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer [[W. David Angus]] of [[Stikeman Elliott]], who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition, he met fellow then Stikeman Elliott lawyer [[Stanley Hartt]], who later played a vital role assisting him during his political career as Mulroney Chief of Staff.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/stanley-hartt-80-was-an-articulate-advocate-for-canada/article37597751/|title=Stanley Hartt, 80, was 'an articulate advocate for Canada'|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, [[Dalton Camp]], who by then was president of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out of the spotlight. With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1967|1967 leadership convention]] in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister [[E. Davie Fulton]]. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to [[Robert Stanfield]], who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMulroney's professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|''La Presse'']]. In doing so, Mulroney and the paper's owner, Canadian business mogul [[Paul Desmarais]], became friends. After his initial difficulties, Mulroney's reputation in his firm steadily increased, and he was made a partner in 1971.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nMulroney's big break came during the [[Robert Cliche|Cliche Commission]] in 1974,<ref name=\"Lotz\">Jim Lotz, ''Prime Ministers of Canada'', Bison Books, 1987, p. 144.</ref> which was set up by Quebec premier [[Robert Bourassa]] to investigate the situation at the [[James Bay Project]], Canada's largest [[hydroelectric]] project. Violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa, the Liberal premier, placed Robert Cliche, a former leader of the provincial [[New Democratic Party of Quebec|New Democratic Party]] in charge. Cliche asked Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative and a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney asked [[Lucien Bouchard]] to join as counsel. The committee's proceedings, which showed [[Rizzuto crime family|Mafia]] infiltration of the unions, made Mulroney well known in Quebec, as the hearings were extensively covered in the media.<ref name=\"Lotz\" /> The Cliche Commission's report was largely adopted by the Bourassa government. A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec, when it emerged that Paul Desrochers, Bourassa's special executive assistant had met with the union boss [[Andr\u00e9 Desjardins]], known as the \"King of Construction\", to ask for his help with winning a by-election in exchange guaranteeing that only companies employing workers from his union would work on the James Bay project.<ref>Sawatsky, John ''Mulroney: the politics of ambition'', Toronto: Mcfarlane Walter & Ross, 1991 page 257.</ref> Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of 'executive privilege'.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for re-election in 1988.\n\n==Loses first leadership race, 1975\u201376==\nThe Stanfield-led Progressive Conservatives lost the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 election]] to the [[Pierre Trudeau]]-led Liberals, leading to Stanfield's resignation as leader. Mulroney, despite never having run for elected office, entered the contest to replace him. Mulroney and provincial rival [[Claude Wagner]] were both seen as potentially able to improve the party's standing in Quebec, which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. Mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting Wagner to the PC party a few years earlier, and the two wound up as rivals for Quebec delegates, most of whom were snared by Wagner, who even blocked Mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the leadership race, Mulroney spent an estimated $500,000, far more than the other candidates, and earned himself the nickname 'Cadillac candidate'. At the [[1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention|1976 leadership convention]], Mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind Wagner. However, his expensive campaign, slick image, lack of parliamentary experience, and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates, and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses, and his campaign finished deeply in debt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Following the convention, Mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in Clark's caucus.\n\n==Business leadership==\nMulroney took the job of executive vice president of the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the [[Schefferville]] mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1469-9795/politics_economy/brian_mulroney/clip5|publisher=[[CBC News]]|title=Private life after public loss \u2013 Television \u2013 CBC Archives}}</ref> Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaler. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.\n\n==Party leader==\nJoe Clark led the Progressive Conservative party to a minority government in the [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979 federal election]] which ended 16 years of continuous Liberal rule. However, the government fell after a successful no-confidence motion over his minority government's budget in December 1979. The PCs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to Trudeau and the Liberals. Many Tories were also annoyed with Clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in June 1979. By late 1982, Joe Clark's leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many Tory members of Parliament, despite his solid national lead over Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] in opinion polls, which stretched to 19 percent in summer 1982.\n[[File:Mulroney 1983.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Mulroney on the floor of the 1983 leadership convention. Photograph by [[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Alasdair Roberts]].]]\nMulroney, while publicly endorsing Clark at a press conference in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's [[leadership review]]. Clark's key Quebec organizer Rodrigue Pageau was in fact a double agent, working for Mulroney, undermining Clark's support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 per cent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in [[Winnipeg]], he resigned and ran to regain his post at the [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1983|1983 leadership convention]]. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, ''Where I Stand'', published in 1983.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nMulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec.  Patrick Martin noted that a poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark's home province of Alberta, and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney's home province of Quebec.{{sfn|Martin, Gregg, Perlin|p=237}} However it was Mulroney's strong showing amongst Ontario delegates (65% to 34%) seemed to account for most of his margin of victory.{{sfn|Martin, Gregg, Perlin|p=237}} A New York Times article from 1984, argued that Mulroney was elected from \"the right-wing elements \"within the party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/06/world/man-in-the-news-a-modern-centrist-in-canada-martin-brian-mulroney.html|title=Man in the News; a Modern Centrist in Canada: Martin Brian Mulroney|date=September 6, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 26, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>   [[Tasha Kheiriddin|Tasha Kheiridden]], writing in La Presse argued that \"Brian Mulroney's injuries to Joe Clark in 1983 took more than 15 years to heal, as various factions continued to compete for leadership roles in the field and youth wings.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/47bc0cb5-ead9-4989-8f3a-ea08a0017b56__7C___0.html|title=Le Parti conservateur n'ira nulle part avec Scheer|date=November 7, 2019|website=La Presse+|language=fr|access-date=November 25, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTwo months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for [[Central Nova]] in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat, after [[Elmer MacKay]] stood aside in his favour. This is a common practice in most [[parliamentary system]]s.\n\nThroughout his political career, Mulroney's fluency in English and French, with Quebec roots in both cultures, gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBecause of health problems shortly after becoming party leader, Mulroney quit smoking in 1983.\n\nBy the start of 1984, as Mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken for granted that Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney in the general election due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February, and the Liberal Party chose [[John Turner]], previously the Minister of Finance under Trudeau in the 1970s, as its new leader. The Liberals then surged in the polls, to take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as Prime Minister, Turner called a general election for September. In so doing, he had to postpone a planned Canadian summer visit by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], who makes it her policy not to travel abroad during foreign election campaigns. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.<ref>''The Insiders: Government, Business, and the Lobbyists,'' by [[John Sawatsky]], 1987</ref>\n\nThe campaign is best remembered for Mulroney's attacks on a raft of Liberal patronage appointments. In his final days in office, Trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of [[Senate of Canada|Senators]], judges, and executives on various governmental and [[crown corporation]] boards, widely seen as a way to offer 'plum jobs' to loyal members of the Liberal Party. Upon assuming office, Turner, who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a Toronto lawyer, showed that his political instincts had diminished. He had been under pressure to advise Governor General [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to cancel the appointments\u2014which convention would then have required Sauv\u00e9 to do. However, Turner chose not to do so, and instead proceeded to appoint several more Liberals to prominent political offices per a signed, legal agreement with Trudeau.<ref>Donaldson, p. 320; Newman, p. 71.</ref>\n\nIronically, Turner had planned to attack Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory. In a televised leaders' debate, Turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on Mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] in Quebec. However, Mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of Liberal patronage appointments.<ref name=\"Secret7172\">Newman, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> He demanded that Turner apologize to the country for making \"these horrible appointments.\" Turner replied that \"I had no option\" except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:\n\n<blockquote>[[You had an option, sir]]. You could have said, 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir\u2014to say 'no'\u2014and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /></blockquote>\n\nTurner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /> He could repeat only, \"I had no option.\" A visibly angry Mulroney called this \"an avowal of failure\" and \"a confession of non-leadership.\" The exchange led most papers the next day, with most of them paraphrasing Mulroney's counterattack as \"You had an option, sir\u2014you could have said 'no.'\" Many observers believe that at this point, Mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" />\n\nOn September 4, Mulroney and the Tories won the largest majority government in Canadian history. They took 211 seats, three more than their previous record in 1958. The Liberals won only 40 seats, which, at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in Canadian history. The Conservatives won just over half of the [[Representative democracy|popular vote]] (compared to 53.4 percent in 1958) and led in every province, emerging as a national party for the first time since 1958. Especially important was the Tories' performance in Mulroney's home province, Quebec. The Tories had only won the most seats in that province once since [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896]] \u2013 the 1958 Tory landslide. However, largely due to anger at Trudeau, and Mulroney's promise of a new deal for Quebec, the province swung over dramatically to support him. The Tories had only won one seat out of 75 in 1980 but took 58 seats in 1984. Mulroney yielded Central Nova back to MacKay and instead ran in the eastern Quebec riding of [[Manicouagan (electoral district)|Manicouagan]], which included Baie-Comeau.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Canadian Press]] named Mulroney \"[[Newsmaker of the Year]]\" for the second straight year, making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister (the other being [[Lester B. Pearson|Lester Pearson]]).\n\n==Prime minister (1984\u20131993)==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Brian Mulroney}}\n\n===First mandate (1984\u20131988)===\n[[File:Milabrianmulroney.jpg|thumb|Mila (left) and Brian (right) Mulroney greet Rt. Hon. Pierre Trudeau (Foreground).]]\nThe first Conservative majority government in 26 years\u2014and only the second in 54 years\u2014initially seemed to give Mulroney a very formidable position. The Tories had won just over half the popular vote, and no other party crossed the 50-seat mark. On paper, he was free to take Canada in any direction he wanted. However, his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest. His support was based on a 'grand coalition' of socially conservative [[populism|populists]] from the West, [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Such diverse interests became difficult for Mulroney to juggle.<ref>David Bercuson et al. ''Sacred Trust? Brian Mulroney and the Conservative Party in Power'' (1987)</ref>\n\nHe attempted to appeal to the Western provinces, whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success, by cancelling the [[National Energy Program]] and including a large number of Westerners in his Cabinet (including Clark as minister of external affairs). However, he was not completely successful, even aside from economic and constitutional policy. For example, he moved [[CF-18]] servicing from Manitoba to Quebec in 1986, even though the Manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated,<ref>Newman, p. 116.</ref> and received death threats for exerting pressure on Manitoba over French language rights.<ref name=\"Newman427\">Newman, p. 427.</ref>\n\nMany of Mulroney's ministers had little government experience, resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals. Many Tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government.<ref>Newman, p. 91, quoting \"Mulroney's friend Arthur Campeau.\"</ref> Indeed, Mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage, including the reference to Ambassador [[Bryce Mackasey]] as \"there's no whore like an old whore\".<ref name=\"mackasey\">Hamovitch, Eric, Rae Murphy, Robert Chodos. ''Selling Out: Four Years of the Mulroney Government'', 1988.

Pearson to $32.4 billion under [[Pierre Eliott Trudeau]]. However, the country's annual deficit increased during Mulroney's term from $32.4 billion to $39 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/canada-deficit/index.html|title=Canada's deficits and surpluses, 1963-2014|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> His attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises. Also impeding his progress was the Senate, where the Liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power. Led by [[Allan MacEachen]], the Senate took a very assertive role in legislation, forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable House majority.\n\nA major undertaking by Mulroney's government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity. Quebec was the only province that did not sign the new [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] negotiated by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1982, and Mulroney wanted to include Quebec in a new agreement with the rest of Canada. In 1987, he negotiated the Meech Lake Accord with the [[Premier (Canada)|provincial premiers]], a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy Quebec's demand for recognition as a \"[[distinct society]]\" within Canada, and to devolve some powers to the provinces.\n\n[[File:Photograph of The Reagans and Mulroneys in Quebec, Canada - NARA - 198561.jpg|thumb|left|The Mulroneys with President and Mrs. Reagan in Quebec, Canada, March 18, 1985, the day after the famous \"[[Shamrock Summit]]\", when the two leaders sang \"[[When Irish Eyes are Smiling]].\"]]\nAnother of Mulroney's priorities was the privatization of many of Canada's crown corporations.

[[Petro-Canada]] was also later privatized.\n\nThe Air India Flight 182 bombing, which originated in Montreal, happened during Mulroney's first term. This was the largest terrorist act before [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadian or lived in Canada. Many Indo-Canadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt Mulroney did not consider them to be true Canadian citizens as they were not of European descent.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} Furthermore, there were several warnings from the [[Indian government]] to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights.

His report was completed and released on June 17, 2010.\n\nNear the end of his first term, Mulroney gave a formal apology and a $300 million compensation package to the families of the 22,000 [[Japanese Canadians]] who had been divested of their property and [[Japanese Canadian internment|interned during World War II]].\n\nMulroney argue that he set up the Desch\u00eanes Commission of inquiry on Nazi war criminals soon after he was first elected in 1984, even though it was controversial among \u201ccommunities where Nazi criminals posed as respectable citizens.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cjnews.com/news/criticism-israel-not-necessarily-antisemitic-mulroney|title=Criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitic: Mulroney|last=Arnold|first=Janice|last2=Reporter|first2=Staff|date=May 13, 2013|website=The Canadian Jewish News|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign policy====\nMulroney's government opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa and he met with many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure. His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. Also, external affairs minister [[Joe Clark]] was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated [[Ethiopia]] to lead the Western response to the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|1984\u20131985 famine in that country]]; Clark landed in [[Addis Ababa]] so quickly he had not even seen the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] report that had created the initial and strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the US and Britain to follow suit almost immediately \u2014 an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time, since Ethiopia had a [[Marxist]] regime and had previously been isolated by Western governments.\n\nThe Mulroney government also took a strong stand against the U.S. intervention in Nicaragua under Reagan, and accepted [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the [[Reagan administration]].\n\n====Free trade====\nDuring his tenure as prime minister, Brian Mulroney's close relationship with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] helped secure a landmark treaty on [[acid rain]] and the ratification of a free-trade treaty with the United States under which all [[tariff]]s between the two countries would be eliminated by 1998.<ref>Stephen Clarkson. ''Canada and the Reagan Challenge: Crisis and Adjustment, 1981\u201385'' (2nd ed. 1985) ch 5, 8</ref>\n\nCritics noted that Mulroney had originally professed opposition to [[free trade]] during the 1983 leadership campaign.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Donaldson, p. 334.</ref> Though the 1985 report of the [[MacDonald Commission]] suggested free trade as one of the idea to him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/royal-commission-on-economic-union-and-development-prospects-for-canada/|title=Royal Commission on Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada|last=Banting|first=Keith G.|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> This agreement was controversial, and the Senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote. The [[Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement|Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] was the central issue of the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 election]], with the Liberals and NDP opposing it. With the Liberals gaining the initial momentum, a successful counterattack by [[Allan Gregg]] resulted in the PCs being re-elected with a solid but reduced majority and 43 percent of the popular vote. In addition, the trade deal gained the support of future [[Quebec premier]]<nowiki/>s [[Jacques Parizeau]] and [[Bernard Landry]], which helped Mulroney to maintain their standing in Quebec.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/01/parti-qubcois-the-author-of-its-own-misfortune-hbert.html|title=Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois the author of its own misfortune: H\u00e9bert {{!}} The Star|work=Toronto Star|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Thus he became the only Canadian Conservative party leader in the 20th century to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime. In this election, Mulroney transferred to another eastern Quebec seat, [[Charlevoix (electoral district)|Charlevoix]], after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include Baie-Comeau.\n\nAlthough most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal.\n\nOn election day, November 21, 1988, Mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the AMEX Bank of Canada (owned by [[American Express]]).\n\n===Second mandate (1988\u20131993)===\nMulroney's second term was marked by an economic recession. He proposed the introduction of a national sales tax, the [[General sales tax|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), in the [[1989 Canadian federal budget|1989 budget]]. When it was introduced in 1991, it replaced the [[Manufacturers' Sales Tax]] (MST) that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in Canada. A bitter Senate battle ensued, and many polls showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to the tax. Mulroney had to use Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators. Although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney's use of an \"emergency\" clause in the constitution.<ref name=\"Raymond B. Blake 2007\"/>\n\nThe Meech Lake Accord also met its doom in 1990. It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline. This failure sparked a revival of [[Quebec separatism]],<ref name=\"Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22\"/> and led to another round of meetings in [[Charlottetown]] in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in the [[Charlottetown Accord]], which outlined extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's unpopularity for the fall of the Accord.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nIn 1990 Mulroney nominated [[Ray Hnatyshyn]], an MP from [[Saskatoon]] and a former Cabinet minister, to be [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] (1990\u20131995).\n\nOn December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.\n\n[[File:nafta.jpg|thumb|right|NAFTA Initialing Ceremony, October 1992; From left to right: (Standing) Mexican President [[Carlos Salinas|Salinas]], US President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]], Prime Minister Mulroney, (Seated) [[Jaime Serra Puche]], [[Carla Hills]], [[Michael Wilson (Canadian politician)|Michael Wilson]].]]\nThe worldwide [[recession]] of the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base \u2013 this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the [[Bank of Canada]] began to raise interest rates in order to meet a [[zero inflation]] target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the [[Canadian dollar]] and damaging Canada's international credit rating.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nMulroney supported the United Nations coalition during the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and when the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a [[CF18|CF-18]] squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of [[The Royal Canadian Regiment]] to safeguard these ground elements calling Canada's participation [[Operation Friction]]. In August he sent the destroyers [[HMCS Terra Nova|HMCS ''Terra Nova'']] and [[HMCS Athabaskan (DDG 282)|HMCS ''Athabaskan'']] to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship [[HMCS Protecteur|HMCS ''Protecteur'']] was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the air war began, Canada's planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the fighting on Cyprus in 1974 that Canadian forces participated directly in combat operations.\n\nFor the [[Canadian Forces]], the Mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment. Most members of the CF welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services, replacing the single green uniform worn since unification (1967\u201370). A White Paper proposed boosting the CF's combat capability, which had, according to Canadian Defence Quarterly, declined so badly that Canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the Gulf War had it desired to. The CF in this period did undergo a much-needed modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms. Many proposed reforms, however, failed to occur, and according to historian [[J.L. Granatstein]], Mulroney \"raised the military's hopes repeatedly, but failed to deliver.\" In 1984, he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to 92,000 troops, but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below 80,000 by 1993. This was, however, in step with other NATO countries after the end of the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm|title=Defence Policy Review (MR-112E)|publisher=Parl.gc.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094454/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm|archive-date=March 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Mulroney government undertook a defence policy review, publishing a new statement in late 1991, but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the [[post Cold War era]] was arrived at before the government's defeat in 1993. According to Granatstein, this meant that Canada was not able to live up to its post-Cold War military commitments.\n\nThe decline of [[cod]] stocks in Atlantic Canada led the Mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there, putting an end to a large portion of the Newfoundland fishing industry, and causing serious economic hardship. The government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the Atlantic provinces.\n\nThe environment was a key focus of Mulroney's government, as Canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the UN Conference on the Environment. His government added significant new national parks ([[Bruce Peninsula National Park|Bruce Peninsula]], [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|South Moresby]], and [[Grasslands National Park|Grasslands]]), and passed the ''[[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]'' and ''[[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nIn 1991, ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' magazine ran a satirical advertisement for a contest inviting young Tories to \"Deflower Caroline Mulroney\". Her father was incensed and threatened physical harm toward those responsible before joining several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to [[rape]] on national television. Frank's editor [[Michael Bate]], called the spoof, intended to mock her unpopular father for bringing her to public adult oriented events, \"clumsy\" but had no regrets. Bate also shared sympathy towards her father's reaction over the spoof.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/07/05/to-be-perfectly-frank/7621f45a-de22-4384-abad-d072b4b511b5/|title=TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK ...|last=Trueheart|first=Charles|date=July 5, 1993|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 2, 2018|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement===\nWidespread public resentment of the Goods and Services Tax, an economic slump, the fracturing of his political coalition, and his lack of results regarding the Quebec situation caused Mulroney's popularity to decline considerably during his second term. An ominous sign was a 1989 by-election in the Alberta riding of [[Beaver River (electoral district)|Beaver River]]. In this election, called when Tory MP [[John Dahmer]] died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting, [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] candidate [[Deborah Grey]] won by a hefty 4,200 votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier. This was perhaps, the first sign that Mulroney's grand coalition was fracturing; the PCs had dominated Alberta's federal politics since the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 election]]. Another sign came before [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] was finalized, when Bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit. After the failure of Meech, Bouchard convinced several other Tories to break with the party and join him to form the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], a pro-[[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] (i.e. ''independentist'') party. Years later, Mulroney said that his biggest error as Prime Minister had been trusting his former university friend; indeed, he and Bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lucien Bouchard says 'wounds' remain with Brian Mulroney|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lucien-bouchard-says-wounds-remain-with-brian-mulroney-1.2742836|accessdate=March 15, 2018|agency=The Canadian Press|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMulroney entered 1993 facing a [[1993 Canadian federal election|statutory general election]] (under Canadian law, federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years, but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons in order to continue in office). By this time, his approval ratings had dipped into the teens, and were at 11% in a 1992 [[Gallup poll]], making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in Canada in the 1940s.<ref>Russell Ash, ''The Top 10 of Everything 2000'', Montreal: The Reader's Digest Association (Canada) Ltd., 1999, p. 80.</ref> There was a consensus that Mulroney would be heavily defeated by [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and the Liberals if he led the Tories into the next election\u2014ironically, the same situation that led to Trudeau's departure from the scene nine years earlier. He announced his retirement from politics in February and was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Defence Minister]] [[Kim Campbell]] in June. The last Gallup Poll taken before his retirement, in February 1993, showed his approval ratings had rebounded to 21%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=61 |title=Home &#124; Waterloo News |website=Newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527134748/http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=61 |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn his final days in office, Mulroney made several decisions that hampered the Tory campaign later that year. He took a lavish international \"farewell\" tour<ref>Donaldson, p. 349.</ref> mostly at taxpayers' expense, without transacting any official business. Also, by the time he handed power to Campbell, there were only two-and-a-half months left in the Tories' five-year mandate. Further compounding the problem, Mulroney continued to live at [[24 Sussex Drive]] for some time after Campbell was sworn in as Prime Minister. Brian and Mila Mulroney's new private residence in Montreal was undergoing renovations, and they did not move out of 24 Sussex until their new home was ready. Instead, Campbell took up residence at [[Harrington Lake]], the Prime Minister's official summer retreat across the river in [[Gatineau Park|Gatineau Park, Quebec]].\n\nThe 1993 election was a disaster for the Tories. The oldest party in Canada was reduced from a majority with 151 seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level. The 149-seat loss far exceeded the 95-seat loss the Liberals suffered in 1984. The Tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the House of Commons, since the required minimum number of seats for [[official party status]] is 12. As an example of the antipathy toward Mulroney, his former riding fell to the Bloc by a lopsided margin; the Tory candidate finished a distant third, with only 6,800 votes\u2014just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esm.ubc.ca/CA93/results.html|title=1993 Canadian Federal Election Results (Detail)|publisher=Esm.ubc.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> In her memoirs, ''[[Time and Chance (book)|Time and Chance]]'', and in her response in the ''[[National Post]]'' to ''[[The Secret Mulroney Tapes]]'', Campbell said that Mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the Tories' reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off. Campbell went as far as to claim that Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election, and wanted a \"scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity\" rather than a true successor. In 2019, Campbell revealed in an interview with Macleans to that people asked her why she was nice to Mulroney. She said that Mulroney was \"a pragmatist, not an ideologue.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroney-from-scandal-adjacent-elitist-to-magnanimous-statesman/|title=Brian Mulroney: From scandal-adjacent elitist to magnanimous statesman - Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|access-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112214043/https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroney-from-scandal-adjacent-elitist-to-magnanimous-statesman/|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Airbus/Schreiber affair===\n{{main|Airbus affair}}\n\nOn September 29, 1995, the Canadian Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the RCMP, sent a Letter of Request to the Swiss Government asking for information related to allegations that Mulroney was involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulroney Launches Suit|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mulroney-launches-suit/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe investigation pertained to \"improper commissions\" allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber (or to companies controlled by him), Brian Mulroney and former Newfoundland premier Frank Moores in exchange for three government contracts.<ref name=\"oliph\">{{Cite web |url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.gc.ca%2Fcollections%2Fcollection_2010%2Fbcp-pco%2FCP32-92-2-2010-1-eng.pdf |title=Government of Canada website \u2013 Oliphant Commission p. 54 |access-date=December 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194727/http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.gc.ca%2Fcollections%2Fcollection_2010%2Fbcp-pco%2FCP32-92-2-2010-1-eng.pdf |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThese contracts involved the purchase of Airbus Industrie aircraft by Air Canada; the purchase of helicopters by the Canadian Coast Guard from Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB) in 1986; and the establishment of a manufacturing plant for Thyssen Light Armoured Vehicles (Bear Head Project) in the province of Nova Scotia, a project which Mulroney as prime minister had cancelled.<ref name=\"oliph\"/>\n\nThis Letter of Request (LOR) \"and its contents were to be kept confidential\" but the letter was leaked to the media.<ref>[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/bcp-pco/CP32-92-3-2010-eng.pdf Government of Canada website \u2013 Oliphant Commission Executive Summary p. 3]</ref> As a result, Mulroney launched a $50 million libel lawsuit against the Government of Canada and the RCMP on November 20, 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Superior Court exhibit|url=http://www.williamkaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/exhibit-26.pdf|website=William Kaplan|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref> On January 5, 1997, Mr. Mulroney agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the Government of Canada and the RCMP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulroney Wins Apology|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mulroney-wins-an-apology/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==After politics==\nSince leaving office, Mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm [[Norton Rose]].

In early 2009, Mulroney \"called a high-ranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists\" due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs,<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090331.wparty01sb/BNStory/politics/home Mulroney not a Tory any more?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404042431/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090331.wparty01sb/BNStory/politics/home |date=April 4, 2009 }}, Campbell Clark, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', April 1, 2009</ref> although he denies this claim.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090408.wPOLharper0408/BNStory/politics/home Ignatieff has 'no moral compass,' PM says] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411033829/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090408.wPOLharper0408/BNStory/politics/home |date=April 11, 2009 }}, Brian Laghi, ''The Globe and Mail'', April 8, 2009</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nMulroney's legacy is complicated and even emotional. Mulroney makes the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication.<ref name=\"Newman, p. 361\"/> His Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, \"Dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\" Mulroney's legacy in Canada is associated mostly with the 1988 Free Trade Agreement<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> and the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST).\n\nAlthough the Tories were re-elected in 1988 campaigning on free trade, they won with only 43% of the popular vote, compared to 52% of the vote which went to the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] who campaigned mostly against the agreement. However, when the Liberals under Jean Chr\u00e9tien came to office in 1993 promising to re-negotiate key parts of the agreement, they continued the deal with only slight changes, and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] which expanded the free trade area to include Mexico.\n\nThe visibility of the GST proved to be very unpopular. The GST was created to help eliminate the ever-growing deficit and to replace the hidden Manufacturer's sales tax, which Mulroney argued was hurting business. Mulroney's usage of a rare Constitutional clause to push the tax through,<ref>Donaldson, p. 344.</ref> prices not falling very much with the MST removed, and the \"in your face\" nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public. The succeeding Liberal government of Jean Chr\u00e9tien campaigned in 1993 on a promise to eliminate the GST (as per the Red Book), but ultimately backed away from that promise. This prompted two of their members [[Sheila Copps]] and [[John Nunziata]] to resign or be expelled in protest. Mulroney's supporters argue that the GST helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit, and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable.\n\nMulroney's intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many Conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years. His government had flirted with 10 percent approval ratings in the early 1990s, when Mulroney's honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media, by Canadians in general and by his political colleagues.<ref>Donaldson, p. 327.</ref> During the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced to just two seats, which was seen as partially due to a backlash against Mulroney, as well as due to the fracturing of his \"Grand Coalition\".\n\n[[Social conservative]]s found fault with Mulroney's government in a variety of areas. These include Mulroney's opposition to capital punishment<ref name=\"Newman427\" /> and an attempted compromise on [[abortion in Canada|abortion]].<ref name=\"Donaldson, p. 356\"/> [[Fiscal conservative]]s likewise didn't appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of \"big government\" programs and political [[patronage]].\n\nIn the 1993 election, nearly all of the Tories' Western support transferred into Reform, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing force in Canada. The Tories only won two seats west of Quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late 1980s. The Canadian right was not reunited until they merged with Reform's successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], in December 2003 to form the new Conservative Party of Canada. Mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former PC leaders [[Joe Clark]], [[Jean Charest]] and [[Kim Campbell]] either opposed it or expressed ambivalence.\n\nMilitary historians Norman Hillmer and [[J.L. Granatstein]] ranked Mulroney eighth among Canada's prime ministers in their 1999 book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders''.\n\nOn March 31, 2009, it was reported by various news outlets that a Conservative official claimed Mulroney was no longer a member of the party. They claimed his membership expired in 2006 and was not renewed. Additionally, Mulroney allegedly \"called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease.\" However, a Mulroney confidante, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the party's claims preposterous. 'He's part of the history of this party, you can't rewrite history. If they're worried about branding, then shut the inquiry down. They're the ones who called the inquiry.' \"<ref>[https://archive.today/20120730203253/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090331/mulroney_tories_090331/20090331?hub=QPeriod Tories, Mulroney in tiff over party membership].

''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', April 22, 2013.</ref> His tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms, such as the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]]. Prior to his political career, he was a prominent lawyer and businessman in Montreal. He later ran for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] and won in a landslide in the [[1984 Canadian federal election]], defeating [[John Turner]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and [[Ed Broadbent]] of the [[New Democratic Party|NDP]], not only winning every single province and territory but also capturing over 50% of the vote for the first time since [[1958 Canadian federal election|1958]] and increasing his party's seats by 111, up to 211 seats, the highest amount of seats won by any party in Canadian history. The 6.3 million votes won by Mulroney also remained a record until the [[2015 Canadian federal election|Liberals' victory in 2015]]. Throughout his political career, Mulroney's fluency in English and French gave him a decisive advantage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nHe brought forth a constitutional reform, the [[Meech Lake Accord]], in 1987, meant to persuade the government of [[Quebec]] to endorse the [[Constitution Act, 1982|1982 constitutional amendments]]. It was not ratified by the provincial governments of [[Manitoba]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] before the June ratification deadline, and thus met its demise in 1990. This loss led to another round of meetings in [[Charlottetown]] in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in Mulroney introducing the [[Charlottetown Accord]], which would create extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was defeated by a large margin in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's rising unpopularity for the fall of the Accord.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\">Blake, ed., ''Transforming the Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney'' (2007)</ref> The end of the Meech Lake Accord in 1990 created division in the country and sparked a revival of [[Quebec separatism]], culminating in the creation and rise of the [[Bloc Quebecois]] (BQ).<ref name=\"Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22\">Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Mulroney opposed the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa and he met with many of the regime's opposition leaders throughout his tenure. His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. He led the Western response to the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]], to strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the US and Britain to follow suit almost immediately \u2014 an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time in a country that had previously been isolated by Western governments. The Mulroney government was also strongly against the U.S. [[Sandinista#Sandinistas vs. Contras|intervention]] in Nicaragua under Reagan, and accepted [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries with repressive regimes that were supported by the [[Reagan administration]]. On December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.\n\nDuring his first term, the [[Air India Flight 182]] bombing occurred. This was the largest terrorist act of the time, with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadians. There were several warnings from the [[Indian government]] to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights, which raised questions as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.<ref name=\"story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=90d8bfad-8bd6-43d6-9899-ad8f0649db87&k=79609 |title=story |publisher=Canada.com |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109115600/https://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=90d8bfad-8bd6-43d6-9899-ad8f0649db87&k=79609 |archivedate=November 9, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"ctv story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060925/airindia_inquiry_060925/20060925?hub=TopStories |title=ctv story |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206080041/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060925/airindia_inquiry_060925/20060925?hub=TopStories |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=The Canadian Press|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/11/07/air-india.html|title=CBC website November 7, 2007|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the environment, Mulroney made it a key focus of his government, and moved Canada to become the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention, which were agreed to at the United Nations Conference on the Environment. His government added significant new national parks ([[Bruce Peninsula National Park|Bruce Peninsula]], [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|South Moresby]], and [[Grasslands National Park|Grasslands]]) and passed the ''[[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]'' and the ''[[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/> In response to the decline of [[cod]] in Atlantic Canada, the Mulroney government imposed a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the cod fishery there, putting an end to a large portion of the Newfoundland fishing industry. This caused rising economic hardship. His government instituted various programs designed to mitigate these problems, but still started to become deeply unpopular in the Atlantic provinces.\n\nOn social issues, Mulroney opposed capital punishment<ref name=\"Newman427\" /> and attempted a compromise on [[abortion in Canada|abortion]], to the dismay of [[social conservative]]s.<ref name=\"Donaldson, p. 356\">Donaldson, p. 356.</ref>\n\nMulroney's second term was marked by an economic recession. He proposed the introduction of a national [[sales tax]], the Goods and Services Tax (GST). When it was introduced in 1991, it replaced the Manufacturers' Sales Tax (MST), which was previously applied to goods manufactured in Canada. This was contentious among the Senate, and public polling showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to it. Mulroney then used Section 26, a Constitutional provision, to allow him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators. Although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney's use of an \"emergency\" clause in the constitution.<ref name=\"Raymond B. Blake 2007\">Raymond B. Blake, ed., ''Transforming the Nation: Canada and Brian Mulroney'' (2007)</ref> [[Fiscal conservative]]s likewise did not approve of Mulroney's tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of \"[[big government]]\" programs and political [[patronage]]. This caused a stark decline in Mulroney's popularity, which induced him to resign and hand over his power to [[Kim Campbell]], who became the 19th Prime Minister of Canada on June 25, 1993.\n\nBrian Mulroney is also particularly famous for delivering one of the few \"knockout blows\" in Canadian debate history by commenting \"[[You had an option, sir]]\" over John Turner's appointments. Turner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney,<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /> and only could repeat \"I had no option.\" A visibly angry Mulroney then called this \"an avowal of failure\" and \"a confession of non-leadership\".\n\nMulroney's legacy is complicated and even emotional. Mulroney makes the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication.<ref name=\"Newman, p. 361\">Newman, p. 361.</ref> His Deputy Prime Minister [[Don Mazankowski]] made a claim that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, \"Dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\" Military historians [[Norman Hillmer]] and [[J.L. Granatstein]] ranked Mulroney eighth among Canada's prime ministers in their 1999 book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders''. Former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader [[Michel Gauthier]] considered Brian Mulroney to be the greatest prime minister Canada has known in the last 50 years due to its political projects taken by him such as Meech Lake accord, the fight against apartheid, an economic project, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a fiscal project, which was to put the finances of the state back in order, and also pointed out that there was no constitutional quarrel between the federal and Quebec Government.<ref name=\"lapresse.ca\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201805/11/01-5181588-michel-gauthier-se-joint-aux-conservateurs.php|title=Michel Gauthier se joint aux conservateurs|date=May 12, 2018|website=La Presse|language=fr|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref> In 2006, he was proclaimed Canada\u2019s greenest prime minister by a survey of environmentalists, due to his efforts such as the Canada-U.S. acid rain treaty, an ambitious environmental agenda, the creation of eight new national parks, and the ratification of the Environmental Protection Act.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mulroney-honoured-for-environmental-record-1.616580</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMulroney was born on March 20, 1939, in [[Baie-Comeau, Quebec]], a remote and isolated town in the eastern part of the province.

In 2001, St. Thomas University named its newest academic building in his honour.

The twins served as page boys and train bearers at the [[wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle]] on May 19, 2018, which their parents also attended, and their sister was one of the bridesmaids.\n\n==Education==\nMulroney entered [[St. Francis Xavier University]] in the fall of 1955 as a 16-year-old freshman. His political life began when he was recruited to the campus Progressive Conservative group by [[Lowell Murray]] and others, early in his first year. Murray would become a close friend, mentor, and adviser who was appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]] in 1979. Other important, lasting friendships made there by Mulroney included [[Gerald Doucet]], [[Fred Doucet]], [[Sam Wakim]], and [[Patrick MacAdam]]. Mulroney enthusiastically embraced political organization, and assisted the local PC candidate in his successful 1956 Nova Scotia provincial election campaign; the PCs, led provincially by [[Robert Stanfield]], swept to a surprise victory.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMulroney became a youth delegate and attended the 1956 leadership convention in [[Ottawa]]. While initially undecided, Mulroney was captivated by [[John Diefenbaker]]'s powerful oratory and easy approachability. Mulroney joined the \"Youth for Diefenbaker\" committee which was led by [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], a future [[kinship|scion]] of Canadian business. Mulroney struck an early friendship with Diefenbaker (who won the leadership) and received telephone calls from him.<ref name=\"Donaldson310\"/>\n\nMulroney won several public speaking contests at St. Francis Xavier University, was a star member of the school's [[debating]] team, and never lost an interuniversity debate. He was also very active in campus politics, serving with distinction in several [[Model Parliament]]s, and was campus prime minister in a [[Maritimes]]-wide Model Parliament in 1958.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMulroney also assisted with the 1958 national election campaign at the local level in Nova Scotia; a campaign that led to the largest majority in Canadian history.<ref>''The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], 1991</ref> After graduating from St. Francis Xavier with a degree in political science in 1959, Mulroney at first pursued a law degree from [[Dalhousie Law School]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]. It was around this time that Mulroney also cultivated friendships with the Tory premier of Nova Scotia, Robert Stanfield, and his chief adviser [[Dalton Camp]]. In his role as an 'advance man', Mulroney significantly assisted with Stanfield's successful 1960 re-election campaign. Mulroney neglected his studies, then fell seriously ill during the winter term, was hospitalized, and, despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness, left his program at Dalhousie after the first year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He then applied to [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in Quebec City, and restarted first-year law there the next year.\n\nIn [[Quebec City]], Mulroney befriended future Quebec [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Daniel Johnson, Sr]], and frequented the provincial legislature, making connections with politicians, aides, and journalists. At Laval, Mulroney built a network of friends, including [[Lucien Bouchard]], [[Bernard Roy]], [[Michel Cogger]], [[Michael Meighen]], and [[Jean Bazin]], that would play a prominent role in Canadian politics for years to come.<ref>H. Graham Rawlinson and [[J.L.

Then a federal election was called, and Prime Minister Diefenbaker appointed Hamilton as the acting prime minister for the rest of the campaign. Hamilton took Mulroney with him on the campaign trail, where the young organizer gained valuable experience.<ref>''The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], 1991, pp. 129\u2013135</ref>\n\n==Builds reputation, gains publicity==\nAfter graduating from Laval in 1964, Mulroney joined the [[Montreal]] law firm now known as [[Norton Rose Fulbright]], which at the time was the largest law firm in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Mulroney twice failed his bar exams, but the firm kept him due to his charming personality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> After ultimately passing his bar exams, Mulroney was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1965, and became a labour lawyer, which was then a new and exciting field of law in Quebec. Mulroney's superb political skills of conciliation and negotiation, with opponents often polarized and at odds, proved ideal for this field. He was noted for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront where he met fellow lawyer [[W. David Angus]] of [[Stikeman Elliott]], who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition, he met fellow then Stikeman Elliott lawyer [[Stanley Hartt]], who later played a vital role assisting him during his political career as Mulroney Chief of Staff.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/stanley-hartt-80-was-an-articulate-advocate-for-canada/article37597751/|title=Stanley Hartt, 80, was 'an articulate advocate for Canada'|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, [[Dalton Camp]], who by then was president of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out of the spotlight. With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1967|1967 leadership convention]] in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister [[E. Davie Fulton]]. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to [[Robert Stanfield]], who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMulroney's professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper [[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|''La Presse'']]. In doing so, Mulroney and the paper's owner, Canadian business mogul [[Paul Desmarais]], became friends. After his initial difficulties, Mulroney's reputation in his firm steadily increased, and he was made a partner in 1971.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nMulroney's big break came during the [[Robert Cliche|Cliche Commission]] in 1974,<ref name=\"Lotz\">Jim Lotz, ''Prime Ministers of Canada'', Bison Books, 1987, p. 144.</ref> which was set up by Quebec premier [[Robert Bourassa]] to investigate the situation at the [[James Bay Project]], Canada's largest [[hydroelectric]] project. Violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa, the Liberal premier, placed Robert Cliche, a former leader of the provincial [[New Democratic Party of Quebec|New Democratic Party]] in charge. Cliche asked Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative and a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney asked [[Lucien Bouchard]] to join as counsel. The committee's proceedings, which showed [[Rizzuto crime family|Mafia]] infiltration of the unions, made Mulroney well known in Quebec, as the hearings were extensively covered in the media.<ref name=\"Lotz\" /> The Cliche Commission's report was largely adopted by the Bourassa government. A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec, when it emerged that Paul Desrochers, Bourassa's special executive assistant had met with the union boss [[Andr\u00e9 Desjardins]], known as the \"King of Construction\", to ask for his help with winning a by-election in exchange guaranteeing that only companies employing workers from his union would work on the James Bay project.<ref>Sawatsky, John ''Mulroney: the politics of ambition'', Toronto: Mcfarlane Walter & Ross, 1991 page 257.</ref> Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of 'executive privilege'.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for re-election in 1988.\n\n==Loses first leadership race, 1975\u201376==\nThe Stanfield-led Progressive Conservatives lost the [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974 election]] to the [[Pierre Trudeau]]-led Liberals, leading to Stanfield's resignation as leader. Mulroney, despite never having run for elected office, entered the contest to replace him. Mulroney and provincial rival [[Claude Wagner]] were both seen as potentially able to improve the party's standing in Quebec, which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. Mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting Wagner to the PC party a few years earlier, and the two wound up as rivals for Quebec delegates, most of whom were snared by Wagner, who even blocked Mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In the leadership race, Mulroney spent an estimated $500,000, far more than the other candidates, and earned himself the nickname 'Cadillac candidate'. At the [[1976 Progressive Conservative leadership convention|1976 leadership convention]], Mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind Wagner. However, his expensive campaign, slick image, lack of parliamentary experience, and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates, and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses, and his campaign finished deeply in debt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Following the convention, Mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in Clark's caucus.\n\n==Business leadership==\nMulroney took the job of executive vice president of the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the [[Schefferville]] mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1469-9795/politics_economy/brian_mulroney/clip5|publisher=[[CBC News]]|title=Private life after public loss \u2013 Television \u2013 CBC Archives}}</ref> Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaler. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.\n\n==Party leader==\nJoe Clark led the Progressive Conservative party to a minority government in the [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979 federal election]] which ended 16 years of continuous Liberal rule. However, the government fell after a successful no-confidence motion over his minority government's budget in December 1979. The PCs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to Trudeau and the Liberals. Many Tories were also annoyed with Clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in June 1979. By late 1982, Joe Clark's leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many Tory members of Parliament, despite his solid national lead over Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] in opinion polls, which stretched to 19 percent in summer 1982.\n[[File:Mulroney 1983.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Mulroney on the floor of the 1983 leadership convention. Photograph by [[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Alasdair Roberts]].]]\nMulroney, while publicly endorsing Clark at a press conference in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's [[leadership review]]. Clark's key Quebec organizer Rodrigue Pageau was in fact a double agent, working for Mulroney, undermining Clark's support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 per cent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in [[Winnipeg]], he resigned and ran to regain his post at the [[Progressive Conservative leadership convention, 1983|1983 leadership convention]]. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, ''Where I Stand'', published in 1983.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nMulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec.  Patrick Martin noted that a poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark's home province of Alberta, and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney's home province of Quebec.{{sfn|Martin, Gregg, Perlin|p=237}} However it was Mulroney's strong showing amongst Ontario delegates (65% to 34%) seemed to account for most of his margin of victory.{{sfn|Martin, Gregg, Perlin|p=237}} A New York Times article from 1984, argued that Mulroney was elected from \"the right-wing elements \"within the party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/06/world/man-in-the-news-a-modern-centrist-in-canada-martin-brian-mulroney.html|title=Man in the News; a Modern Centrist in Canada: Martin Brian Mulroney|date=September 6, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 26, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>   [[Tasha Kheiriddin|Tasha Kheiridden]], writing in La Presse argued that \"Brian Mulroney's injuries to Joe Clark in 1983 took more than 15 years to heal, as various factions continued to compete for leadership roles in the field and youth wings.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plus.lapresse.ca/screens/47bc0cb5-ead9-4989-8f3a-ea08a0017b56__7C___0.html|title=Le Parti conservateur n'ira nulle part avec Scheer|date=November 7, 2019|website=La Presse+|language=fr|access-date=November 25, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nTwo months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for [[Central Nova]] in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat, after [[Elmer MacKay]] stood aside in his favour. This is a common practice in most [[parliamentary system]]s.\n\nThroughout his political career, Mulroney's fluency in English and French, with Quebec roots in both cultures, gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBecause of health problems shortly after becoming party leader, Mulroney quit smoking in 1983.\n\nBy the start of 1984, as Mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken for granted that Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney in the general election due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February, and the Liberal Party chose [[John Turner]], previously the Minister of Finance under Trudeau in the 1970s, as its new leader. The Liberals then surged in the polls, to take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as Prime Minister, Turner called a general election for September. In so doing, he had to postpone a planned Canadian summer visit by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], who makes it her policy not to travel abroad during foreign election campaigns. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.<ref>''The Insiders: Government, Business, and the Lobbyists,'' by [[John Sawatsky]], 1987</ref>\n\nThe campaign is best remembered for Mulroney's attacks on a raft of Liberal patronage appointments. In his final days in office, Trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of [[Senate of Canada|Senators]], judges, and executives on various governmental and [[crown corporation]] boards, widely seen as a way to offer 'plum jobs' to loyal members of the Liberal Party. Upon assuming office, Turner, who had been out of politics for nine years while he earned a lucrative salary as a Toronto lawyer, showed that his political instincts had diminished. He had been under pressure to advise Governor General [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to cancel the appointments\u2014which convention would then have required Sauv\u00e9 to do. However, Turner chose not to do so, and instead proceeded to appoint several more Liberals to prominent political offices per a signed, legal agreement with Trudeau.<ref>Donaldson, p. 320; Newman, p. 71.</ref>\n\nIronically, Turner had planned to attack Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory. In a televised leaders' debate, Turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on Mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] in Quebec. However, Mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of Liberal patronage appointments.<ref name=\"Secret7172\">Newman, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> He demanded that Turner apologize to the country for making \"these horrible appointments.\" Turner replied that \"I had no option\" except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:\n\n<blockquote>[[You had an option, sir]]. You could have said, 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir\u2014to say 'no'\u2014and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /></blockquote>\n\nTurner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" /> He could repeat only, \"I had no option.\" A visibly angry Mulroney called this \"an avowal of failure\" and \"a confession of non-leadership.\" The exchange led most papers the next day, with most of them paraphrasing Mulroney's counterattack as \"You had an option, sir\u2014you could have said 'no.'\" Many observers believe that at this point, Mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister.<ref name=\"Secret7172\" />\n\nOn September 4, Mulroney and the Tories won the largest majority government in Canadian history. They took 211 seats, three more than their previous record in 1958. The Liberals won only 40 seats, which, at the time was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in Canadian history. The Conservatives won just over half of the [[Representative democracy|popular vote]] (compared to 53.4 percent in 1958) and led in every province, emerging as a national party for the first time since 1958. Especially important was the Tories' performance in Mulroney's home province, Quebec. The Tories had only won the most seats in that province once since [[1896 Canadian federal election|1896]] \u2013 the 1958 Tory landslide. However, largely due to anger at Trudeau, and Mulroney's promise of a new deal for Quebec, the province swung over dramatically to support him. The Tories had only won one seat out of 75 in 1980 but took 58 seats in 1984. Mulroney yielded Central Nova back to MacKay and instead ran in the eastern Quebec riding of [[Manicouagan (electoral district)|Manicouagan]], which included Baie-Comeau.\n\nIn 1984, the [[Canadian Press]] named Mulroney \"[[Newsmaker of the Year]]\" for the second straight year, making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister (the other being [[Lester B. Pearson|Lester Pearson]]).\n\n==Prime minister (1984\u20131993)==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Brian Mulroney}}\n\n===First mandate (1984\u20131988)===\n[[File:Milabrianmulroney.jpg|thumb|Mila (left) and Brian (right) Mulroney greet Rt. Hon. Pierre Trudeau (Foreground).]]\nThe first Conservative majority government in 26 years\u2014and only the second in 54 years\u2014initially seemed to give Mulroney a very formidable position. The Tories had won just over half the popular vote, and no other party crossed the 50-seat mark. On paper, he was free to take Canada in any direction he wanted. However, his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest. His support was based on a 'grand coalition' of socially conservative [[populism|populists]] from the West, [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Such diverse interests became difficult for Mulroney to juggle.<ref>David Bercuson et al. ''Sacred Trust? Brian Mulroney and the Conservative Party in Power'' (1987)</ref>\n\nHe attempted to appeal to the Western provinces, whose earlier support had been critical to his electoral success, by cancelling the [[National Energy Program]] and including a large number of Westerners in his Cabinet (including Clark as minister of external affairs). However, he was not completely successful, even aside from economic and constitutional policy. For example, he moved [[CF-18]] servicing from Manitoba to Quebec in 1986, even though the Manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated,<ref>Newman, p. 116.</ref> and received death threats for exerting pressure on Manitoba over French language rights.<ref name=\"Newman427\">Newman, p. 427.</ref>\n\nMany of Mulroney's ministers had little government experience, resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals. Many Tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government.<ref>Newman, p. 91, quoting \"Mulroney's friend Arthur Campeau.\"</ref> Indeed, Mulroney made a number of unscripted gaffes regarding patronage, including the reference to Ambassador [[Bryce Mackasey]] as \"there's no whore like an old whore\".<ref name=\"mackasey\">Hamovitch, Eric, Rae Murphy, Robert Chodos. ''Selling Out: Four Years of the Mulroney Government'', 1988.

Pearson to $32.4 billion under [[Pierre Eliott Trudeau]]. However, the country's annual deficit increased during Mulroney's term from $32.4 billion to $39 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/canada-deficit/index.html|title=Canada's deficits and surpluses, 1963-2014|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> His attempts to reduce spending limited his ability to deliver on many promises. Also impeding his progress was the Senate, where the Liberals had a large majority due to their previous long tenure in power. Led by [[Allan MacEachen]], the Senate took a very assertive role in legislation, forcing the government to compromise on several points despite its considerable House majority.\n\nA major undertaking by Mulroney's government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity. Quebec was the only province that did not sign the new [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] negotiated by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1982, and Mulroney wanted to include Quebec in a new agreement with the rest of Canada. In 1987, he negotiated the Meech Lake Accord with the [[Premier (Canada)|provincial premiers]], a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy Quebec's demand for recognition as a \"[[distinct society]]\" within Canada, and to devolve some powers to the provinces.\n\n[[File:Photograph of The Reagans and Mulroneys in Quebec, Canada - NARA - 198561.jpg|thumb|left|The Mulroneys with President and Mrs. Reagan in Quebec, Canada, March 18, 1985, the day after the famous \"[[Shamrock Summit]]\", when the two leaders sang \"[[When Irish Eyes are Smiling]].\"]]\nAnother of Mulroney's priorities was the privatization of many of Canada's crown corporations.

[[Petro-Canada]] was also later privatized.\n\nThe Air India Flight 182 bombing, which originated in Montreal, happened during Mulroney's first term. This was the largest terrorist act before [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then [[Indian Prime Minister]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadian or lived in Canada. Many Indo-Canadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt Mulroney did not consider them to be true Canadian citizens as they were not of European descent.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}} Furthermore, there were several warnings from the [[Indian government]] to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.<ref name=\"story\"/><ref name=\"ctv story\"/><ref>{{cite news|agency=The Canadian Press|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/11/07/air-india.html|title=CBC website November 7, 2007|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> The [[Queen-in-Council|Governor General-in-Council]] in 2006 appointed the former [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John C.

His position put him at odds with the American and British governments, but also won him respect elsewhere. Also, external affairs minister [[Joe Clark]] was the first foreign affairs minister to land in previously isolated [[Ethiopia]] to lead the Western response to the [[1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|1984\u20131985 famine in that country]]; Clark landed in [[Addis Ababa]] so quickly he had not even seen the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] report that had created the initial and strong public reaction. Canada's response was overwhelming and led the US and Britain to follow suit almost immediately \u2014 an unprecedented situation in foreign affairs at that time, since Ethiopia had a [[Marxist]] regime and had previously been isolated by Western governments.\n\nThe Mulroney government also took a strong stand against the U.S. intervention in Nicaragua under Reagan, and accepted [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries with repressive regimes supported directly by the [[Reagan administration]].\n\n====Free trade====\nDuring his tenure as prime minister, Brian Mulroney's close relationship with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] helped secure a landmark treaty on [[acid rain]] and the ratification of a free-trade treaty with the United States under which all [[tariff]]s between the two countries would be eliminated by 1998.<ref>Stephen Clarkson.

In this election, Mulroney transferred to another eastern Quebec seat, [[Charlevoix (electoral district)|Charlevoix]], after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include Baie-Comeau.\n\nAlthough most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal.\n\nOn election day, November 21, 1988, Mulroney made a controversial order in council which allowed the establishment of the AMEX Bank of Canada (owned by [[American Express]]).\n\n===Second mandate (1988\u20131993)===\nMulroney's second term was marked by an economic recession. He proposed the introduction of a national sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), in the [[1989 Canadian federal budget|1989 budget]]. When it was introduced in 1991, it replaced the [[Manufacturers' Sales Tax]] (MST) that had previously been applied at the wholesale level on goods manufactured in Canada. A bitter Senate battle ensued, and many polls showed that as many as 80% of Canadians were opposed to the tax. Mulroney had to use Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint 8 new Senators. Although the government argued that the tax was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, the highly visible nature of the tax was extremely unpopular, and many resented Mulroney's use of an \"emergency\" clause in the constitution.<ref name=\"Raymond B. Blake 2007\"/>\n\nThe Meech Lake Accord also met its doom in 1990. It was not ratified by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline. This failure sparked a revival of [[Quebec separatism]],<ref name=\"Rawlinson and Graham, p. 22\"/> and led to another round of meetings in [[Charlottetown]] in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in the [[Charlottetown Accord]], which outlined extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's unpopularity for the fall of the Accord.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nIn 1990 Mulroney nominated [[Ray Hnatyshyn]], an MP from [[Saskatoon]] and a former Cabinet minister, to be [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] (1990\u20131995).\n\nOn December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.\n\n[[File:nafta.jpg|thumb|right|NAFTA Initialing Ceremony, October 1992; From left to right: (Standing) Mexican President [[Carlos Salinas|Salinas]], US President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]], Prime Minister Mulroney, (Seated) [[Jaime Serra Puche]], [[Carla Hills]], [[Michael Wilson (Canadian politician)|Michael Wilson]].]]\nThe worldwide [[recession]] of the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base \u2013 this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the [[Bank of Canada]] began to raise interest rates in order to meet a [[zero inflation]] target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the [[Canadian dollar]] and damaging Canada's international credit rating.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nMulroney supported the United Nations coalition during the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and when the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a [[CF18|CF-18]] squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of [[The Royal Canadian Regiment]] to safeguard these ground elements calling Canada's participation [[Operation Friction]]. In August he sent the destroyers [[HMCS Terra Nova|HMCS ''Terra Nova'']] and [[HMCS Athabaskan (DDG 282)|HMCS ''Athabaskan'']] to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship [[HMCS Protecteur|HMCS ''Protecteur'']] was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the air war began, Canada's planes were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the fighting on Cyprus in 1974 that Canadian forces participated directly in combat operations.\n\nFor the [[Canadian Forces]], the Mulroney years began with hope but ended with disappointment. Most members of the CF welcomed the return to distinctive uniforms for the three services, replacing the single green uniform worn since unification (1967\u201370). A White Paper proposed boosting the CF's combat capability, which had, according to Canadian Defence Quarterly, declined so badly that Canada would have been unable to send a brigade to the Gulf War had it desired to. The CF in this period did undergo a much-needed modernization of a range of equipment from trucks to a new family of small arms. Many proposed reforms, however, failed to occur, and according to historian [[J.L. Granatstein]], Mulroney \"raised the military's hopes repeatedly, but failed to deliver.\" In 1984, he had promised to increase the military budget and the regular force to 92,000 troops, but the budget was cut and the troop level fell to below 80,000 by 1993. This was, however, in step with other NATO countries after the end of the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm|title=Defence Policy Review (MR-112E)|publisher=Parl.gc.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311094454/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/mr112-e.htm|archive-date=March 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Mulroney government undertook a defence policy review, publishing a new statement in late 1991, but political considerations meant that no comprehensive policy for the [[post Cold War era]] was arrived at before the government's defeat in 1993. According to Granatstein, this meant that Canada was not able to live up to its post-Cold War military commitments.\n\nThe decline of [[cod]] stocks in Atlantic Canada led the Mulroney government to impose a moratorium on the cod fishery there, putting an end to a large portion of the Newfoundland fishing industry, and causing serious economic hardship. The government instituted various programmes designed to mitigate these effects but still became deeply unpopular in the Atlantic provinces.\n\nThe environment was a key focus of Mulroney's government, as Canada became the first industrialized country to ratify both the biodiversity convention and the climate change convention agreed to at the UN Conference on the Environment. His government added significant new national parks ([[Bruce Peninsula National Park|Bruce Peninsula]], [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site|South Moresby]], and [[Grasslands National Park|Grasslands]]), and passed the ''[[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]'' and ''[[Canadian Environmental Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"Blake 2007\"/>\n\nIn 1991, ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' magazine ran a satirical advertisement for a contest inviting young Tories to \"Deflower Caroline Mulroney\". Her father was incensed and threatened physical harm toward those responsible before joining several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to [[rape]] on national television. Frank's editor [[Michael Bate]], called the spoof, intended to mock her unpopular father for bringing her to public adult oriented events, \"clumsy\" but had no regrets. Bate also shared sympathy towards her father's reaction over the spoof.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/07/05/to-be-perfectly-frank/7621f45a-de22-4384-abad-d072b4b511b5/|title=TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK ...|last=Trueheart|first=Charles|date=July 5, 1993|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 2, 2018|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n===Retirement===\nWidespread public resentment of the Goods and Services Tax, an economic slump, the fracturing of his political coalition, and his lack of results regarding the Quebec situation caused Mulroney's popularity to decline considerably during his second term. An ominous sign was a 1989 by-election in the Alberta riding of [[Beaver River (electoral district)|Beaver River]]. In this election, called when Tory MP [[John Dahmer]] died before ever having a chance to attend a sitting, [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] candidate [[Deborah Grey]] won by a hefty 4,200 votes after finishing fourth in the general election just five months earlier. This was perhaps, the first sign that Mulroney's grand coalition was fracturing; the PCs had dominated Alberta's federal politics since the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 election]]. Another sign came before [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] was finalized, when Bouchard resigned from both the cabinet and the party over changes to the proposal that he felt diluted its spirit. After the failure of Meech, Bouchard convinced several other Tories to break with the party and join him to form the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], a pro-[[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] (i.e. ''independentist'') party. Years later, Mulroney said that his biggest error as Prime Minister had been trusting his former university friend; indeed, he and Bouchard have not spoken to each other in over two decades.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lucien Bouchard says 'wounds' remain with Brian Mulroney|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lucien-bouchard-says-wounds-remain-with-brian-mulroney-1.2742836|accessdate=March 15, 2018|agency=The Canadian Press|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMulroney entered 1993 facing a [[1993 Canadian federal election|statutory general election]] (under Canadian law, federal governments can have a maximum duration of five years, but they often have lesser duration as they must enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons in order to continue in office). By this time, his approval ratings had dipped into the teens, and were at 11% in a 1992 [[Gallup poll]], making him one of the most unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in Canada in the 1940s.<ref>Russell Ash, ''The Top 10 of Everything 2000'', Montreal: The Reader's Digest Association (Canada) Ltd., 1999, p. 80.</ref> There was a consensus that Mulroney would be heavily defeated by [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and the Liberals if he led the Tories into the next election\u2014ironically, the same situation that led to Trudeau's departure from the scene nine years earlier. He announced his retirement from politics in February and was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Defence Minister]] [[Kim Campbell]] in June. The last Gallup Poll taken before his retirement, in February 1993, showed his approval ratings had rebounded to 21%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=61 |title=Home &#124; Waterloo News |website=Newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527134748/http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=61 |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn his final days in office, Mulroney made several decisions that hampered the Tory campaign later that year. He took a lavish international \"farewell\" tour<ref>Donaldson, p. 349.</ref> mostly at taxpayers' expense, without transacting any official business. Also, by the time he handed power to Campbell, there were only two-and-a-half months left in the Tories' five-year mandate. Further compounding the problem, Mulroney continued to live at [[24 Sussex Drive]] for some time after Campbell was sworn in as Prime Minister. Brian and Mila Mulroney's new private residence in Montreal was undergoing renovations, and they did not move out of 24 Sussex until their new home was ready. Instead, Campbell took up residence at [[Harrington Lake]], the Prime Minister's official summer retreat across the river in [[Gatineau Park|Gatineau Park, Quebec]].\n\nThe 1993 election was a disaster for the Tories. The oldest party in Canada was reduced from a majority with 151 seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level. The 149-seat loss far exceeded the 95-seat loss the Liberals suffered in 1984. The Tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the House of Commons, since the required minimum number of seats for [[official party status]] is 12. As an example of the antipathy toward Mulroney, his former riding fell to the Bloc by a lopsided margin; the Tory candidate finished a distant third, with only 6,800 votes\u2014just a few votes shy of losing his electoral deposit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esm.ubc.ca/CA93/results.html|title=1993 Canadian Federal Election Results (Detail)|publisher=Esm.ubc.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}</ref> In her memoirs, ''[[Time and Chance (book)|Time and Chance]]'', and in her response in the ''[[National Post]]'' to ''[[The Secret Mulroney Tapes]]'', Campbell said that Mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the Tories' reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off. Campbell went as far as to claim that Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election, and wanted a \"scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity\" rather than a true successor. In 2019, Campbell revealed in an interview with Macleans to that people asked her why she was nice to Mulroney. She said that Mulroney was \"a pragmatist, not an ideologue.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroney-from-scandal-adjacent-elitist-to-magnanimous-statesman/|title=Brian Mulroney: From scandal-adjacent elitist to magnanimous statesman - Macleans.ca|website=Maclean's|access-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112214043/https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/brian-mulroney-from-scandal-adjacent-elitist-to-magnanimous-statesman/|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Airbus/Schreiber affair===\n{{main|Airbus affair}}\n\nOn September 29, 1995, the Canadian Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the RCMP, sent a Letter of Request to the Swiss Government asking for information related to allegations that Mulroney was involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulroney Launches Suit|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mulroney-launches-suit/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe investigation pertained to \"improper commissions\" allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber (or to companies controlled by him), Brian Mulroney and former Newfoundland premier Frank Moores in exchange for three government contracts.<ref name=\"oliph\">{{Cite web |url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.gc.ca%2Fcollections%2Fcollection_2010%2Fbcp-pco%2FCP32-92-2-2010-1-eng.pdf |title=Government of Canada website \u2013 Oliphant Commission p. 54 |access-date=December 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194727/http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.gc.ca%2Fcollections%2Fcollection_2010%2Fbcp-pco%2FCP32-92-2-2010-1-eng.pdf |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThese contracts involved the purchase of Airbus Industrie aircraft by Air Canada; the purchase of helicopters by the Canadian Coast Guard from Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB) in 1986; and the establishment of a manufacturing plant for Thyssen Light Armoured Vehicles (Bear Head Project) in the province of Nova Scotia, a project which Mulroney as prime minister had cancelled.<ref name=\"oliph\"/>\n\nThis Letter of Request (LOR) \"and its contents were to be kept confidential\" but the letter was leaked to the media.<ref>[http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/bcp-pco/CP32-92-3-2010-eng.pdf Government of Canada website \u2013 Oliphant Commission Executive Summary p. 3]</ref> As a result, Mulroney launched a $50 million libel lawsuit against the Government of Canada and the RCMP on November 20, 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Superior Court exhibit|url=http://www.williamkaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/exhibit-26.pdf|website=William Kaplan|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref> On January 5, 1997, Mr. Mulroney agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the Government of Canada and the RCMP.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mulroney Wins Apology|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mulroney-wins-an-apology/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==After politics==\nSince leaving office, Mulroney has served as an international business consultant and remains a partner with the law firm [[Norton Rose]].

According to press reports his membership lapsed in 2006. In early 2009, Mulroney \"called a high-ranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists\" due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs,<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090331.wparty01sb/BNStory/politics/home Mulroney not a Tory any more?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404042431/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090331.wparty01sb/BNStory/politics/home |date=April 4, 2009 }}, Campbell Clark, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', April 1, 2009</ref> although he denies this claim.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090408.wPOLharper0408/BNStory/politics/home Ignatieff has 'no moral compass,' PM says] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411033829/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090408.wPOLharper0408/BNStory/politics/home |date=April 11, 2009 }}, Brian Laghi, ''The Globe and Mail'', April 8, 2009</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nMulroney's legacy is complicated and even emotional. Mulroney makes the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication.<ref name=\"Newman, p. 361\"/> His Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, \"Dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\" Mulroney's legacy in Canada is associated mostly with the 1988 Free Trade Agreement<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> and the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST).\n\nAlthough the Tories were re-elected in 1988 campaigning on free trade, they won with only 43% of the popular vote, compared to 52% of the vote which went to the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] who campaigned mostly against the agreement. However, when the Liberals under Jean Chr\u00e9tien came to office in 1993 promising to re-negotiate key parts of the agreement, they continued the deal with only slight changes, and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] which expanded the free trade area to include Mexico.\n\nThe visibility of the GST proved to be very unpopular. The GST was created to help eliminate the ever-growing deficit and to replace the hidden Manufacturer's sales tax, which Mulroney argued was hurting business. Mulroney's usage of a rare Constitutional clause to push the tax through,<ref>Donaldson, p. 344.</ref> prices not falling very much with the MST removed, and the \"in your face\" nature of the tax infuriated politicians and the public. The succeeding Liberal government of Jean Chr\u00e9tien campaigned in 1993 on a promise to eliminate the GST (as per the Red Book), but ultimately backed away from that promise. This prompted two of their members [[Sheila Copps]] and [[John Nunziata]] to resign or be expelled in protest. Mulroney's supporters argue that the GST helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit, and that the visible nature of the tax kept politicians more accountable.\n\nMulroney's intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many Conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years. His government had flirted with 10 percent approval ratings in the early 1990s, when Mulroney's honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media, by Canadians in general and by his political colleagues.<ref>Donaldson, p. 327.</ref> During the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced to just two seats, which was seen as partially due to a backlash against Mulroney, as well as due to the fracturing of his \"Grand Coalition\".\n\n[[Social conservative]]s found fault with Mulroney's government in a variety of areas. These include Mulroney's opposition to capital punishment<ref name=\"Newman427\" /> and an attempted compromise on [[abortion in Canada|abortion]].<ref name=\"Donaldson, p. 356\"/> [[Fiscal conservative]]s likewise didn't appreciate his tax increases and his failure to curtail expansion of \"big government\" programs and political [[patronage]].\n\nIn the 1993 election, nearly all of the Tories' Western support transferred into Reform, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing force in Canada. The Tories only won two seats west of Quebec in the next decade and recovered only upon reunification the elements that had split from the party in the late 1980s. The Canadian right was not reunited until they merged with Reform's successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], in December 2003 to form the new Conservative Party of Canada. Mulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger at a time when former PC leaders [[Joe Clark]], [[Jean Charest]] and [[Kim Campbell]] either opposed it or expressed ambivalence.\n\nMilitary historians Norman Hillmer and [[J.L. Granatstein]] ranked Mulroney eighth among Canada's prime ministers in their 1999 book ''Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders''.\n\nOn March 31, 2009, it was reported by various news outlets that a Conservative official claimed Mulroney was no longer a member of the party. They claimed his membership expired in 2006 and was not renewed. Additionally, Mulroney allegedly \"called a senior party official two months ago to ask that his name be pulled off all party lists and materials and that communications with him cease.\" However, a Mulroney confidante, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the party's claims preposterous. 'He's part of the history of this party, you can't rewrite history. If they're worried about branding, then shut the inquiry down. They're the ones who called the inquiry.' \"<ref>[https://archive.today/20120730203253/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090331/mulroney_tories_090331/20090331?hub=QPeriod Tories, Mulroney in tiff over party membership].

Her words hazily allude to memories, with the sound of footsteps as the only sound to be heard on the beach.\n# Clov's Pantomime:  Clov and Hamm appear.  Clov is troubled and uneasy on his legs.  He makes repetitive gestures, the same gestures every day, during his domestic chores, interspersed with short, nervous laughter.\n# Clov's First Monologue:  Clov speaks of the possibility that the current situation may come to some sort of end soon.\n# Hamm's First Monologue:  by contrast, Hamm thinks about his and his parents' sufferings.  With feelings of despondency and exhaustion, he claims that he cannot resolve the current circumstances.\n# Bin:  Nagg and Nell, both severely handicapped, are tired out from their long-term bickering, and their mutual incomprehension.  During their conversation, they recall the cycling accident in the Ardennes that caused them both to lose their legs.  Memories also surface of a boat trip on Lake Como.  These memories are their sole happy memories and, at least superficially, give them a little nostalgia for their life spent together.  Yet, Hamm, who wants to sleep, finds his parents' chatter irritating, and orders Clov to throw the bins, including Nagg and Nell, into the sea.  Nell dies in the meantime, apparently unnoticed by the others.\n# Novel: Hamm wants to tell Nagg a story.  In past days, a father had come to him on Christmas Eve asking for bread for his son.  Hamm had decided to take him on.\n# Nagg's Monologue:  Nagg remembers when Hamm was young and needed him.\n# Hamm's Penultimate Monologue:  Hamm ponders his difficult relations with others.\n# Hamm and Clov's Dialogue:  Hamm asks Clov for his tranquilliser.  Clov replies that no tranquillisers are left. \n# \"It's over, Clov\" and Clov's Vaudeville:  Hamm tells Clov that he no longer needs him, but then asks Clov to say something that he may remember before departing.  Clov remarks that Hamm had never spoken to him until that moment.  Only now, as he is about to leave, does Hamm pay any notice of him. \n# Clov's Last Monologue:  Clov reflects on his condition.  He has never understood what words like 'love' and 'friendship' mean.  He also feels old, tired, and unable to form new habits.  He is bound to his repetitive, never-changing daily routine.\n# Transition to the Finale:  Hamm thanks Clov as Clov is about to leave.\n# Hamm's Last Monologue:  Clov is about to leave, but has not yet moved.  Hamm realises that he has been left alone. \n# Epilogue:  Hamm grasps that it is now up to him \u2013 and him alone \u2013 to continue playing the endgame.\n\n==Reception==\nBoth Andrew Clements<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/19/fin-de-partie-la-scala-milan-review-gyorgy-kurtag-samuel-beckett|title=Fin de Partie review \u2013 Kurt\u00e1g's compelling musical testament|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=2018-11-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and Fiona Maddocks<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/24/fin-de-partie-gyorgy-kurtag-la-scala-milan-review-war-requiem-eno-britten-wolfgang-tillmans|title=Fin de partie review \u2013 Kurt\u00e1g's thrilling endgame|last=Maddocks|first=Fiona|date=2018-11-24|work=The Observer|access-date=2019-10-12|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref> of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded ''Fin de partie'' a full five stars.

When that initial study seemed to confirm a link, he decided to conduct a complete study of all prisons.\n\nIn 1897 Vorderman visited all of the around 100 prisons on the island of Java. He took samples of the prison rice and examined the prison records to determine the number of beriberi cases. He kept the real purpose of his visits secret so that word did not get around the Chinese rice suppliers and lead them to change the type of rice they provided.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vandenbroucke |first=Jan P. |year=2013 |title=Adolphe Vorderman's 1897 study on beriberi: an example of scrupulous efforts to avoid bias |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=108\u2013111 |doi=10.1177/0141076813478790 |pmid=23481433 |pmc=3595404 }}</ref>\n\nLater he conducted blind testing with rice experts to discover the make-up and origin of the rice varieties he found in the prison samples.\n\nVorderman found that in the prisons using mostly brown rice, the incidence of beriberi was less than 1 in 10,000. In the prisons serving mainly polished white rice the proportion was 1 in 39. In his published report, he concluded that this marked difference could not be explained by any other nutritional or sanitary factor.\n\nLater others, including [[Gerrit Grijns]], took over the research which ultimately led to the discovery of [[vitamins]]. In the case of beriberi, the vitamin that was lost when the [[bran]] was removed was [[thiamin]]&nbsp;\u2013 vitamin B<sub>1</sub>.\n\nIn a 2007 episode of the [[BBC]] [[genealogy|genealogical]] documentary series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are?
