The Wolverines competed in the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fifth season.\n\nComing off a [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] appearance in [[2018 Michigan Wolverines football team|2018]], Michigan began the year as slight favorites to win the Big Ten Conference, and were ranked seventh in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. Under the leadership of new offensive coordinator [[Josh Gattis]], the Wolverine offense struggled in the early part of the season. In the second game of the year, Michigan escaped with an overtime win against [[2019 Army Black Knights football team|Army]]. Two weeks later, the team was soundly defeated by [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 35\u201314. Analysts saw as a turning point for the offense its second half performance against then-No. 7 [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but their comeback attempt failed as they lost 28\u201321. The team defeated rivals [[2019 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] and [[2019 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] in blowouts at home, but ended the regular season with a loss to [[2019 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], their eighth straight loss in the series. Michigan was invited to the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] to play [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], where they lost 35\u201316 to end the year at 9\u20134, 6\u20133 in Big Ten play.\n\nThe offense was led by senior quarterback [[Shea Patterson]], who became just the third Wolverine passer to ever eclipse the 3,000 yards passing mark. Offensive linemen [[Ben Bredeson]] and Jon Runyan were both named first-team all-conference. The defense was led by first-team all-conference cornerback [[Lavert Hill]], as well as linemen Kwity Paye and [[Josh Uche]], and linebacker [[Khaleke Hudson]].\n\n==Preseason==\n===Coaching changes===\nMichigan defensive line coach [[Greg Mattison]] and linebackers coach Al Washington both left to take jobs at [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] in early January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2019/01/08/michigan-football-al-washington-ohio-state-coaching-staff/2513136002/|title=Michigan football's Al Washington leaving for Ohio State Buckeyes|date=January 8, 2019|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|first=Nick|last=Baumgardner|access-date=February 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202095201/https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2019/01/08/michigan-football-al-washington-ohio-state-coaching-staff/2513136002/|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Michigan announced the hiring of [[Josh Gattis]] as offensive coordinator on January 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2019/01/10/michigan-football-hires-josh-gattis-offensive-coordinator/2539959002/|title=Michigan football hires offensive coordinator Josh Gattis|first=Nick|last=Baumgardner|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=January 10, 2019|access-date=February 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203231053/https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/university-michigan/wolverines/2019/01/10/michigan-football-hires-josh-gattis-offensive-coordinator/2539959002/|archive-date=February 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He previously was the wide receivers coach and co-offensive coordinator at [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for one season.

The Wolverines competed in the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fifth season.\n\nComing off a [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]] appearance in [[2018 Michigan Wolverines football team|2018]], Michigan began the year as slight favorites to win the Big Ten Conference, and were ranked seventh in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. Under the leadership of new offensive coordinator [[Josh Gattis]], the Wolverine offense struggled in the early part of the season. In the second game of the year, Michigan escaped with an overtime win against [[2019 Army Black Knights football team|Army]]. Two weeks later, the team was soundly defeated by [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 35\u201314. Analysts saw as a turning point for the offense its second half performance against then-No. 7 [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but their comeback attempt failed as they lost 28\u201321. The team defeated rivals [[2019 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] and [[2019 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] in blowouts at home, but ended the regular season with a loss to [[2019 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], their eighth straight loss in the series. Michigan was invited to the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] to play [[2019 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], where they lost 35\u201316 to end the year at 9\u20134, 6\u20133 in Big Ten play.\n\nThe offense was led by senior quarterback [[Shea Patterson]], who became just the third Wolverine passer to ever eclipse the 3,000 yards passing mark. Offensive linemen [[Ben Bredeson]] and Jon Runyan were both named first-team all-conference.

The first stage prohibits the woman to all other men, requiring a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'' (religious divorce) to dissolve, and the final stage permits the couple to each other. The ceremony that accomplishes nisuin is known as ''chuppah''.<ref name=\"RKap18\">Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapter 18</ref>\n\nToday, ''erusin/kiddushin'' occurs when the groom gives the bride a ring or other object of value with the intent of creating a marriage. There are differing opinions as to which part of the ceremony constitutes ''nissuin/chuppah''; they include standing under the canopy - itself called a ''chuppah'' - and being alone together in a room (''[[yichud]]'').<ref name=\"RKap18\"/> While historically these two events could take place as much as a year apart,<ref>[[Talmud Bavli]], Ketubot, page 2</ref> they are now commonly combined into one ceremony.<ref name=\"RKap18\"/>\n\n== Signing of the marriage contract ==\nBefore the wedding ceremony, the groom agrees to be bound by the terms of the ''[[ketubah]]'' (marriage contract) in the presence of two witnesses, whereupon the witnesses sign the ketubah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishweddingnetwork.com/jewish-wedding-traditions|title=Jewish wedding traditions|publisher=|access-date=2010-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727122447/http://www.jewishweddingnetwork.com/jewish-wedding-traditions|archive-date=2010-07-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''ketubah'' details the obligations of the groom to the bride, among which are food, clothing, and marital relations. This document has the standing of a legally binding agreement, though it may be hard to collect these amounts in a secular court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ketubah4you.com/is-the-ketubah-contract-legit-or-just-a-ceremony/|title=Is the Ketubah contract legit or just a ceremony?|website=Ketubah 4 You}}</ref> It is often written as an illuminated manuscript that is framed and displayed in their home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohr.edu/1087|title=The Jewish Wedding Ceremony by Rabbi Mordechai Becher|publisher=}}</ref> Under the ''chuppah'', it is traditional to read the signed ''ketubah'' aloud, usually in the [[Aramaic]] original, but sometimes in translation.

The low value is to ensure that there are no financial barriers to access marriage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MJL |title=All About Jewish Wedding Rings |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/all-about-jewish-wedding-rings/ |website=My Jewish Learning |publisher=70 Faces Media |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Jewish law, the ring must be composed of solid metal (gold or silver are preferred; alloys are discouraged), with no jewel inlays or gem settings, so that it's easy to ascertain the ring's value. Others ascribe a more symbolic meaning, saying that the ring represents the ideal of purity and honesty in a relationship. However, it's quite common for Jewish couples (especially those who are not Orthodox) to use weddings rings with engraving, metallic embellishments, or to go a step further and use gemstone settings. Some Orthodox couples will use a simple gold or silver band during the ceremony to fulfill the halachic obligations, and after the wedding, the bride may wear a ring with any decoration she likes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lamm |first1=Maurice |title=The Marriage Ring in Judaism |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/481776/jewish/The-Marriage-Ring-in-Judaism.htm |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Silberberg |first1=Naftali |title=Halachic Requirements for the Wedding Band |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/476748/jewish/Halachic-Requirements-for-the-Wedding-Band.htm |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe groom gives the bride a ring, traditionally a plain wedding band,<ref name=\"RLamm15\">The Jewish Way in Love &amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp; Row, 1980, Chapter 15</ref> and recites the declaration: ''Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel''.

The bride price (or ring) must have a monetary value no less than a single [[prutah]] (the smallest denomination of currency used during the Talmudic era). The low value is to ensure that there are no financial barriers to access marriage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MJL |title=All About Jewish Wedding Rings |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/all-about-jewish-wedding-rings/ |website=My Jewish Learning |publisher=70 Faces Media |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Jewish law, the ring must be composed of solid metal (gold or silver are preferred; alloys are discouraged), with no jewel inlays or gem settings, so that it's easy to ascertain the ring's value. Others ascribe a more symbolic meaning, saying that the ring represents the ideal of purity and honesty in a relationship. However, it's quite common for Jewish couples (especially those who are not Orthodox) to use weddings rings with engraving, metallic embellishments, or to go a step further and use gemstone settings. Some Orthodox couples will use a simple gold or silver band during the ceremony to fulfill the halachic obligations, and after the wedding, the bride may wear a ring with any decoration she likes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lamm |first1=Maurice |title=The Marriage Ring in Judaism |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/481776/jewish/The-Marriage-Ring-in-Judaism.htm |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Silberberg |first1=Naftali |title=Halachic Requirements for the Wedding Band |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/476748/jewish/Halachic-Requirements-for-the-Wedding-Band.htm |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe groom gives the bride a ring, traditionally a plain wedding band,<ref name=\"RLamm15\">The Jewish Way in Love &amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp; Row, 1980, Chapter 15</ref> and recites the declaration: ''Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel''.

The dividing lines can be ambiguous, several castes have demanded a lower rank so that they can avail the privileges offered. The term [[Forward Castes|Upper caste]] also refers to [[Forward castes]], when news reports refer to the Scheduled castes in relation to the two upper groups.\n\nThe removal of the boundaries between \"civil society\" and \"political society\" meant that caste now played a huge role in the political arena and also influenced other government-run institutions such as police and the judicial system. Though caste seemed to dictate one's access to such institutions, the location of that caste also played a pivotal role. If a [[lower caste]] were concentrated enough in one area, it could then translate that pocket of concentration of its caste members into political power and then challenge the [[hegemony]] of locally dominant [[Forward Castes|upper caste]]. Gender also plays a significant role in the power dynamic of caste in politics. Women's representation within the political system seems to also be tied to their caste. Lower, more conservative castes have less female participation in politics than upper, more socially liberal, castes. This has caused a disproportionately large number of upper-caste women to occupy political office when compared to their lower caste counterparts. The hierarchy of caste and its role in politics and access to power and resources has created a society of patron-client relationships along caste lines. This eventually led to the practice of [[vote bank]]ing, where voters back only candidates that are in their caste,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-per-cent-of-people-vote-on-caste-lines-Katju/articleshow/18117893.cms|title=90 per cent of people vote on caste lines: Katju|website=The Times of India|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> or officials from which they expect to receive some kind of benefits.\n\nHistorically<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/wquRqpqgRGfDP58kN9BNOM/Caste-matters-everywhere-schools-jobs-or-life-at-large.html|title=Caste matters everywhere: schools, jobs or life at large|last=Kishore|first=Roshan|date=28 January 2016|website=www.livemint.com|language=en|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> it has been very hard to change the structure of '''caste politics in India'''. More recently{{When|date=July 2012}} however, there has been a flux in caste politics, mainly caused by [[economic liberalisation in India]]. This upsurge in lower-caste empowerment was accompanied in some regions by a spike in the level of corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?283752 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811041518/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?283752 |archivedate=11 August 2014  }}</ref> This was partly due to lower caste perceiving development programs and rule of law as tools used by the upper caste to subjugate lower castes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/3u2QUPuXBEFPaBQXU2R8mJ/When-will-the-BrahminBania-hegemony-end.html|title=When will the Brahmin-Bania hegemony end?|last=Patel|first=Aakar|date=28 August 2009|website=www.livemint.com|language=en|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary India, however, has seen the influence of caste start to decline. This is partly due to the spread of education to all castes which has had a democratising effect on the political system. However, this \"equalising\" of the playing field has not been without controversy. The [[Mandal Commission]] and its quotas system has been a particularly sensitive issue.\n\nIt has been argued by Professor Dipankar Gupta that the role of castes in Indian elections have been overplayed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-caste-bogey-in-election-analysis/article5811003.ece|title=The caste bogey in election analysis|last=Gupta|first=Dipankar|date=21 March 2014|work=The Hindu|access-date=21 January 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>\n\n==Colonial history==\n{{main|British India}}\n\nThe British institutionalised caste into the workings of the major government institutions within India. The main benefactors of this [[indirect rule]] were the upper castes or [[forward castes]], which maintained their [[hegemony]] and monopoly of control and influence over government institutes long after independence from the British. The state of post-colonial India promised development, rule of law, and [[nation building]], but in reality, was a complex network of [[patronage]] systems, which solidified the upper-caste position of dominance over civil service institutions. This network undermined the very promises of 'nation building' that post-colonial India had made and ushered in an area of upper-caste dominance that lasted for the next four decades.\n\nIn August 1932, the then Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], made what became known as the [[Communal Award]]. According to it, separate representation was to be provided for communities such as the [[Dalit]], [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]] and [[Europeans]]. These depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which only voters belonging to these classes could vote.\n\n==Caste and political power==\n{{Main|Caste system in India}}\nThe caste system has traditionally had significant influence over people's access to power. The privileged upper caste groups benefit more by gaining substantially more economic and political power, while the lower caste groups have limited access to those powers. The caste system distributes to different castes different economic strengths. The upper caste groups can then manipulate the economic and political system to transfer economic strength into political power.<ref name=\"Craig\">{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Jeffrey|title=Caste, Class, and Clientelism: A Political Economy of Everyday Corruption in Rural North India.}}</ref>\n\n===Access to power===\nIn rural North India, upper and middle-ranking castes dominate the ownership of land. They were able to transfer this control over wealth into political dominance over the [[Panchayat]] decision. The Panchayat is a local government unit that is in-charge of resources disbursement. The dominant caste groups monopolised leadership positions in the Panchayat, thus gaining more opportunities to government contracts, employment and funding.\n\nAccess to police and judicial assistance also depends on which caste one belongs to. By bribing, influencing and intimidating the police and judicial officials, the rural north Indian middle and upper castes tend to manipulate the local police and judicial power more successfully. These types of political [[rent-seeking]]'s have also helped secure the supply of rents to dominant castes through other channels such as 'rigging Panchayat elections, capturing electoral booths, and using pre-election intimidatory tactics in elections for the state assembly.'<ref name=\"Craig\" /> Whether an individual or a group can raise enough money for constant bribes depends on the caste-based socioeconomic status. Hence, the advantage in accessing economic resources not only transfers into but also reinforces the political might of the dominant caste groups. Certain scientists and activists, such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[systems science|systems scientist]] Dr. [[Shiva Ayyadurai|VA Shiva Ayyadurai]], blame caste for holding back innovation and scientific research in India, making it difficult to sustain progress while regressive social organisation prevails.<ref name=timesofindia>{{cite news|title=Scientist blames caste for India's backwardness in research|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-25/coimbatore/40792839_1_caste-system-inter-caste-marriages-indian-origin|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=25 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=SpicyIP>{{cite web|last=Reddy|first=Prashant|title=CSIR Tech.

Political lines in India have often been drawn along caste lines; however, this is only part of the story. Caste is often specific to a particular area. These caste pockets create a locally dominant castes. Because of the political structure in India, local dominance can translate into regional dominance. This concentration of caste population has meant that smaller, less influential castes have the opportunity stake there claims in the political power arena. However, if a non-dominant caste is not concentrated in a particular area, then they are not likely to get any representation without teaming up with another caste to increase their influence. This means, \"localised concentration facilitates a space for contesting the domination of State-level dominant caste\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suhas|first=Pahlshikar|title=Caste Politics Through the Prism of Region}}</ref> For instance, the Maratha-Kunbi caste has concentrations of populations all over the [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]]. They thus managed to receive maximum representation at the state legislature.(ibid)\n\nThough the caste system factors greatly in determining who makes up the local elites, it also plays a huge role in determining women's influence and representation in the political system. In India's bicameral parliamentary system, women represent a minuscule amount of each house. Of the people's assembly, made up of 545 members, women represent a mere 5.2 percent; and in the State assembly, with 259 members, women make up only 8.8 percent. Both houses have seen an alarming decline in female representatives in the most recent decades. Of the 39 women representatives in the Indian Parliament most were members of higher castes. Caste, which eventually effects class, is one of the most important factors in determining a woman's successful inclusion into the political system. This may be due to the fact that higher castes challenge the role of the traditional Indian woman and so their caste position gives them a greater range of options that are not available to lower more traditional castes. This inflated representation of elite caste in public offices has meant that the impact they have on public policy is disproportionately large in comparison to their actual numbers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Shirin|title=Class, Caste and Gender- Women in Parliament in India|journal=IDea's Handbook: Women in Parliament: Beyond Numbers|pages=1\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Clientelism===\nPolitics in India highly depended on patron-client ties along the caste lines during the Congress-dominating period. The caste that one belongs to serves as a strong determinant of his or her voting pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kela|first=Shashank|title=Caste, Class and Politics in Contemporary North India}}</ref> In India, different political parties represent the interests of different caste groups. The upper and merchant castes such as Brahmin, Rajput and Kayasth and the rich Muslim groups tend to express their interests through the Congress Party. The agrarian upper caste [[Jats]] tend to vote for the competing parties. Numerically minor parties, represented by the Jan Shangh, receive votes almost exclusively from the upper and trading castes (ibid). However, caste does not solely determine voting behaviours. Discrepancies occur especially for the upper caste groups. (ibid) This means that not everyone from the same caste would vote for only one particular party. The upper caste people have more freedom to vote by political beliefs. The [[Mandal Commission]] covered more than 3000 Other Backward Castes. It is thus not clear which parties are associated with each castes.\n\nLoyal groups of voters usually back a certain candidate or party during elections with the expectation of receiving benefits once their candidate is in office. This practice, called \"[[votebank]]\", is prolific throughout most regions of the country. Many political parties in India have openly indulged in caste-based [[votebank]] politics. The Congress party used votebank to maintain power; the competing parties constructed votebanks to challenge the Congress dominance of politics.\n\n==Caste politics in flux==\n{{See also|Politics of India}}\n\nBy the early 1990s there began a shift in caste politics. The continuation of a one party system, which was the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], composed mostly of upper-caste leadership, came to an end. This was partly due to [[economic liberalisation in India]] which reduced the control the state had on the economy and thus the lower castes, and partly due to an upsurge in caste based parties that made the politics of lower caste empowerment a central part of there political agenda. It should be pointed out that these new political parties emerged not on a national level but on a village and regional level, and were most dominant in North India.\n\nThese parties view development programs and rule of law as institutions used by upper caste to control and subjugate lower castes. As a result, these new political parties sought to weaken these institutions and in turn weaken the upper caste domination in the political arena in India. Since 'rule of law' was seen as controlled by upper-castes, these new parties adopted a strategy that had to operate outside of this rule in order to gain political influence and lower-caste empowerment.\n\n===Political Corruption===\nCorruption thus translated into power and a means to enter the political arena, once only open to upper caste members. [[Corruption in India]] became a way to level the playing field. This struggle for empowerment that was forced to operate outside of the rule of law produced caste-based mafia networks. These mafia-networks began to chip away at upper caste control over state institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Witsoe|first=Jeffrey|title=Corruption as Power: Caste and the Political Imagination of the Postcolonial State}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike their predecessor, these [[caste mafia]] groups were not concerned with 'development', but mainly viewed elections and democracy as a way of gaining control of the state, which would enable them to level social inequalities. This new state envisioned a government of \"Social Justice\" through caste empowerment. Within the context of \"social justice\" corruption pontificated by the caste mafias became tolerated, and in some cases, as in the province of Bihar, even celebrated.\n\nThe very nature of caste politics inherently means that there are no boundaries between \"civil society\" and \"political society\", as demonstrated by the proliferation caste mafia. The mafia dons became mayors, ministers, and even members of Parliament. Therefore, there was no alternative to fight against these mafia figures and political brokers. Because rule of law was perceived to be a mechanism of upper caste control, corruption used by caste mafia became popularly accepted, as it was perceived to be a means to achieve lower caste empowerment. The corruption elevated to such a level that nearly all elected officials in some towns and regions were also criminals. The upper castes who had used their control over the state to discreetly plunder its institutions for their own gain, were now replaced by the mafia dons who now openly pillaged the state institutions. Many of these elected ministers/mafia dons were jailed for the illegal practices they employed; however, this was widely touted as the upper castes trying to regain dominance by eliminating \"social justice\" supporters. Corruption and politics became so common that at a time it was not uncommon for election results to be contested from a prison cell.\n\nCorruption therefore translated into power and a means to enter the political arena, once only open to upper caste members. In this way corruption was seen as a way to level the playing field, and as a result was tolerated and in some villages championed under the banner of \"[[social justice]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Witsoe|first=Jeffrey|title=Corruption as A Power: Caste and the Political Imagination of the Postcolonial State|journal=Journal of the American Ethnological Society|year=2011|volume=38|issue=1|pages=73\u201385|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01293.x}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1951 election, three ethnic parties challenged the Congress party: the Ram Rajya Parishad, the Hindu Mahasabha, and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. These three sought to gain support from the Hindu majority. The All India Scheduled Caste Federation bid for support from the ex-untouchable castes. Three of the four ethnic parties gradually disappeared because they were not able to obtain enough votes. In the late 1980s, the Congress began to decline. More non-congress parties started to challenge the Congress dominance. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) descended from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. It attempted to pit Hindus against Muslims. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Janata Dal ( JD) tried to seek support from the Scheduled Castes, and Muslims against the upper castes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chandra|first=Kanchan|title=Ethnic Parties and Democratic Stability|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=235\u2013252|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050188|citeseerx=10.1.1.483.4574}}</ref>\n\nThe intense party competitions that started in the late 1970s have also weakened the influence of caste in Indian politics. Traditionally, Indian political parties have been constructed from top-down. Party leaders relied on preexisted patron-client networks to collect votes. Hence, no parties established fixed organisations to keep constant contacts with the village-level. Since 1977, the number of youth participating in politics has significantly increased. Due to the lack of fixed organisations, political parties had to rely on the young village members for political mobilisation.<ref name=\"Krishna 2003 1171\u20131193\">{{cite journal|last=Krishna|first=Anirudh|title=What is happening to Caste? A View from Some North Indian Villages|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=November 2003|volume=62|issue=4|pages=1171\u20131193|doi=10.2307/3591763|jstor=3591763}}</ref> Often, these young villagers exerted more political influence than the upper caste leaders and patrons. The status of these young people in the village depended on how much he could contribute to the economic development of the village. It is easier for the youth to maintain their status by rallying rather than remain loyal to a specific party. This also weakened the influence of caste and clientelism on Indian politics.\n\nIn the 1990s, many parties [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP), the [[Samajwadi Party]] and the [[Janata Dal]] started claiming that they were representing the backward castes. Many such parties, relying primarily on Backward Classes' support, often in alliance with Dalits and Muslims, rose to power in Indian states.<ref name=\"country_studies_caste\">{{cite web\n|title=Caste-Based Parties\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/116.htm\n|publisher= Country Studies US\n|accessdate=12 December 2006\n}}</ref> At the same time, many Dalit leaders and intellectuals started realising that the main Dalit oppressors were the so-called Other Backward Classes, and formed their own parties, such as the [[Indian Justice Party]]. The Congress (I) in Maharashtra long relied on OBCs' backing for its political success.<ref name=\"country_studies_caste\"/> [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has also showcased its Dalit and OBC leaders to prove that it is not an upper-caste party. [[Bangaru Laxman]], the former BJP president (2001\u20132002) was a former Dalit. [[Sanyasin]] [[Uma Bharati]], former CM of [[Madhya Pradesh]], who belongs to OBC caste, was a former BJP leader. In 2006 [[Arjun Singh (politician, born 1930)|Arjun Singh]] cabinet minister for MHRD of the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) government was accused of playing caste politics when he introduced reservations for OBCs in educational institutions all around.\n\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party rose to power promising representation of all castes in all important sectors of society.\n\n===Caste-based mobilisation===\nRecent evidence suggests that the influence of caste has been declining. Rather than a long-established, unchanging institution, caste is subject to political influence. Changes in political leadership throughout the history of India have led to changes in the structure of the caste system. India's colonial past has shaped caste into a flexible institution, generating a new system that has crucial influences on political mobilisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rao and Ban|title=The Political Construction of Caste in South India}}</ref> In some regions of India, strategic reconstructions of the caste system have taken place. For instance, the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] was first initiated by urban political entrepreneurs who belonged to the former lower caste groups.<ref name=\"Krishna 2003 1171\u20131193\"/> The pliable caste system in the post-independence era acts as a tool for identifying marginal groups and political mobilisation . Various political leaderships can alter and influence the caste system to give different groups of people unequal rights in accessing public services and political competition.\n\n===Education===\n{{further|Education in India}}\n\nEducation spread to the lower castes after India gained independence. The younger generations of all castes have had access to educational resources since the 1980s. The number of the Scheduled and [[Backward Castes]] people receiving education increased at a faster rate than that of the upper caste groups. The spread of education to all castes generated democratising effects. Some representatives of the SC and ST groups obtained access to Congress in the 1950s~1960s (1179). Due to their higher education levels, they are less likely to respond to the upper-caste patrons, but to the needs and interests of the lower castes.\n\n==Politically Important Castes==\n\n===Haryana===\n* [[Jats]]>Brahmins\n*[[Haryanvi]]([[Yadav]],[[Saini]],[[Gujjar]],[[Chamars]],Dalits,Baniya etc) >[[Punjabi Hindus]] (Khatris ,[[Arora|Aroras]], [[Kapoor|Kapoors]] etc)\n*[[Saini]] >Brahmins in [[Kurukshetra]],[[Yamuna Nagar]] and [[Ambala]]\n* [[Yadav]] in South Haryana\n*\n\n===Andhra Pradesh, Telangana===\n* [[Kamma (caste)|Kamma]]<ref name=\"Aditi_2009\"/> mostly in Guntur/Krishna/Prakasam and other coastal districts.

The dividing lines can be ambiguous, several castes have demanded a lower rank so that they can avail the privileges offered. The term [[Forward Castes|Upper caste]] also refers to [[Forward castes]], when news reports refer to the Scheduled castes in relation to the two upper groups.\n\nThe removal of the boundaries between \"civil society\" and \"political society\" meant that caste now played a huge role in the political arena and also influenced other government-run institutions such as police and the judicial system. Though caste seemed to dictate one's access to such institutions, the location of that caste also played a pivotal role. If a [[lower caste]] were concentrated enough in one area, it could then translate that pocket of concentration of its caste members into political power and then challenge the [[hegemony]] of locally dominant [[Forward Castes|upper caste]]. Gender also plays a significant role in the power dynamic of caste in politics. Women's representation within the political system seems to also be tied to their caste. Lower, more conservative castes have less female participation in politics than upper, more socially liberal, castes. This has caused a disproportionately large number of upper-caste women to occupy political office when compared to their lower caste counterparts. The hierarchy of caste and its role in politics and access to power and resources has created a society of patron-client relationships along caste lines. This eventually led to the practice of [[vote bank]]ing, where voters back only candidates that are in their caste,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/90-per-cent-of-people-vote-on-caste-lines-Katju/articleshow/18117893.cms|title=90 per cent of people vote on caste lines: Katju|website=The Times of India|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> or officials from which they expect to receive some kind of benefits.\n\nHistorically<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/wquRqpqgRGfDP58kN9BNOM/Caste-matters-everywhere-schools-jobs-or-life-at-large.html|title=Caste matters everywhere: schools, jobs or life at large|last=Kishore|first=Roshan|date=28 January 2016|website=www.livemint.com|language=en|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> it has been very hard to change the structure of '''caste politics in India'''.

This is partly due to the spread of education to all castes which has had a democratising effect on the political system. However, this \"equalising\" of the playing field has not been without controversy. The [[Mandal Commission]] and its quotas system has been a particularly sensitive issue.\n\nIt has been argued by Professor Dipankar Gupta that the role of castes in Indian elections have been overplayed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-caste-bogey-in-election-analysis/article5811003.ece|title=The caste bogey in election analysis|last=Gupta|first=Dipankar|date=21 March 2014|work=The Hindu|access-date=21 January 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>\n\n==Colonial history==\n{{main|British India}}\n\nThe British institutionalised caste into the workings of the major government institutions within India. The main benefactors of this [[indirect rule]] were the upper castes or [[forward castes]], which maintained their [[hegemony]] and monopoly of control and influence over government institutes long after independence from the British. The state of post-colonial India promised development, rule of law, and [[nation building]], but in reality, was a complex network of [[patronage]] systems, which solidified the upper-caste position of dominance over civil service institutions. This network undermined the very promises of 'nation building' that post-colonial India had made and ushered in an area of upper-caste dominance that lasted for the next four decades.\n\nIn August 1932, the then Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], made what became known as the [[Communal Award]]. According to it, separate representation was to be provided for communities such as the [[Dalit]], [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]] and [[Europeans]]. These depressed classes were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which only voters belonging to these classes could vote.\n\n==Caste and political power==\n{{Main|Caste system in India}}\nThe caste system has traditionally had significant influence over people's access to power. The privileged upper caste groups benefit more by gaining substantially more economic and political power, while the lower caste groups have limited access to those powers. The caste system distributes to different castes different economic strengths. The upper caste groups can then manipulate the economic and political system to transfer economic strength into political power.<ref name=\"Craig\">{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Jeffrey|title=Caste, Class, and Clientelism: A Political Economy of Everyday Corruption in Rural North India.}}</ref>\n\n===Access to power===\nIn rural North India, upper and middle-ranking castes dominate the ownership of land. They were able to transfer this control over wealth into political dominance over the [[Panchayat]] decision. The Panchayat is a local government unit that is in-charge of resources disbursement. The dominant caste groups monopolised leadership positions in the Panchayat, thus gaining more opportunities to government contracts, employment and funding.\n\nAccess to police and judicial assistance also depends on which caste one belongs to. By bribing, influencing and intimidating the police and judicial officials, the rural north Indian middle and upper castes tend to manipulate the local police and judicial power more successfully. These types of political [[rent-seeking]]'s have also helped secure the supply of rents to dominant castes through other channels such as 'rigging Panchayat elections, capturing electoral booths, and using pre-election intimidatory tactics in elections for the state assembly.'<ref name=\"Craig\" /> Whether an individual or a group can raise enough money for constant bribes depends on the caste-based socioeconomic status. Hence, the advantage in accessing economic resources not only transfers into but also reinforces the political might of the dominant caste groups. Certain scientists and activists, such as [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[systems science|systems scientist]] Dr. [[Shiva Ayyadurai|VA Shiva Ayyadurai]], blame caste for holding back innovation and scientific research in India, making it difficult to sustain progress while regressive social organisation prevails.<ref name=timesofindia>{{cite news|title=Scientist blames caste for India's backwardness in research|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-25/coimbatore/40792839_1_caste-system-inter-caste-marriages-indian-origin|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=25 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=SpicyIP>{{cite web|last=Reddy|first=Prashant|title=CSIR Tech.

Political lines in India have often been drawn along caste lines; however, this is only part of the story. Caste is often specific to a particular area. These caste pockets create a locally dominant castes. Because of the political structure in India, local dominance can translate into regional dominance. This concentration of caste population has meant that smaller, less influential castes have the opportunity stake there claims in the political power arena. However, if a non-dominant caste is not concentrated in a particular area, then they are not likely to get any representation without teaming up with another caste to increase their influence. This means, \"localised concentration facilitates a space for contesting the domination of State-level dominant caste\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suhas|first=Pahlshikar|title=Caste Politics Through the Prism of Region}}</ref> For instance, the Maratha-Kunbi caste has concentrations of populations all over the [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]]. They thus managed to receive maximum representation at the state legislature.(ibid)\n\nThough the caste system factors greatly in determining who makes up the local elites, it also plays a huge role in determining women's influence and representation in the political system. In India's bicameral parliamentary system, women represent a minuscule amount of each house. Of the people's assembly, made up of 545 members, women represent a mere 5.2 percent; and in the State assembly, with 259 members, women make up only 8.8 percent. Both houses have seen an alarming decline in female representatives in the most recent decades. Of the 39 women representatives in the Indian Parliament most were members of higher castes. Caste, which eventually effects class, is one of the most important factors in determining a woman's successful inclusion into the political system. This may be due to the fact that higher castes challenge the role of the traditional Indian woman and so their caste position gives them a greater range of options that are not available to lower more traditional castes. This inflated representation of elite caste in public offices has meant that the impact they have on public policy is disproportionately large in comparison to their actual numbers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Shirin|title=Class, Caste and Gender- Women in Parliament in India|journal=IDea's Handbook: Women in Parliament: Beyond Numbers|pages=1\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Clientelism===\nPolitics in India highly depended on patron-client ties along the caste lines during the Congress-dominating period. The caste that one belongs to serves as a strong determinant of his or her voting pattern.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kela|first=Shashank|title=Caste, Class and Politics in Contemporary North India}}</ref> In India, different political parties represent the interests of different caste groups. The upper and merchant castes such as Brahmin, Rajput and Kayasth and the rich Muslim groups tend to express their interests through the Congress Party. The agrarian upper caste [[Jats]] tend to vote for the competing parties. Numerically minor parties, represented by the Jan Shangh, receive votes almost exclusively from the upper and trading castes (ibid). However, caste does not solely determine voting behaviours. Discrepancies occur especially for the upper caste groups. (ibid) This means that not everyone from the same caste would vote for only one particular party. The upper caste people have more freedom to vote by political beliefs. The [[Mandal Commission]] covered more than 3000 Other Backward Castes. It is thus not clear which parties are associated with each castes.\n\nLoyal groups of voters usually back a certain candidate or party during elections with the expectation of receiving benefits once their candidate is in office. This practice, called \"[[votebank]]\", is prolific throughout most regions of the country. Many political parties in India have openly indulged in caste-based [[votebank]] politics. The Congress party used votebank to maintain power; the competing parties constructed votebanks to challenge the Congress dominance of politics.\n\n==Caste politics in flux==\n{{See also|Politics of India}}\n\nBy the early 1990s there began a shift in caste politics. The continuation of a one party system, which was the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], composed mostly of upper-caste leadership, came to an end. This was partly due to [[economic liberalisation in India]] which reduced the control the state had on the economy and thus the lower castes, and partly due to an upsurge in caste based parties that made the politics of lower caste empowerment a central part of there political agenda. It should be pointed out that these new political parties emerged not on a national level but on a village and regional level, and were most dominant in North India.\n\nThese parties view development programs and rule of law as institutions used by upper caste to control and subjugate lower castes. As a result, these new political parties sought to weaken these institutions and in turn weaken the upper caste domination in the political arena in India. Since 'rule of law' was seen as controlled by upper-castes, these new parties adopted a strategy that had to operate outside of this rule in order to gain political influence and lower-caste empowerment.\n\n===Political Corruption===\nCorruption thus translated into power and a means to enter the political arena, once only open to upper caste members. [[Corruption in India]] became a way to level the playing field. This struggle for empowerment that was forced to operate outside of the rule of law produced caste-based mafia networks. These mafia-networks began to chip away at upper caste control over state institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Witsoe|first=Jeffrey|title=Corruption as Power: Caste and the Political Imagination of the Postcolonial State}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike their predecessor, these [[caste mafia]] groups were not concerned with 'development', but mainly viewed elections and democracy as a way of gaining control of the state, which would enable them to level social inequalities. This new state envisioned a government of \"Social Justice\" through caste empowerment. Within the context of \"social justice\" corruption pontificated by the caste mafias became tolerated, and in some cases, as in the province of Bihar, even celebrated.\n\nThe very nature of caste politics inherently means that there are no boundaries between \"civil society\" and \"political society\", as demonstrated by the proliferation caste mafia. The mafia dons became mayors, ministers, and even members of Parliament. Therefore, there was no alternative to fight against these mafia figures and political brokers. Because rule of law was perceived to be a mechanism of upper caste control, corruption used by caste mafia became popularly accepted, as it was perceived to be a means to achieve lower caste empowerment. The corruption elevated to such a level that nearly all elected officials in some towns and regions were also criminals. The upper castes who had used their control over the state to discreetly plunder its institutions for their own gain, were now replaced by the mafia dons who now openly pillaged the state institutions. Many of these elected ministers/mafia dons were jailed for the illegal practices they employed; however, this was widely touted as the upper castes trying to regain dominance by eliminating \"social justice\" supporters. Corruption and politics became so common that at a time it was not uncommon for election results to be contested from a prison cell.\n\nCorruption therefore translated into power and a means to enter the political arena, once only open to upper caste members. In this way corruption was seen as a way to level the playing field, and as a result was tolerated and in some villages championed under the banner of \"[[social justice]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Witsoe|first=Jeffrey|title=Corruption as A Power: Caste and the Political Imagination of the Postcolonial State|journal=Journal of the American Ethnological Society|year=2011|volume=38|issue=1|pages=73\u201385|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2010.01293.x}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1951 election, three ethnic parties challenged the Congress party: the Ram Rajya Parishad, the Hindu Mahasabha, and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. These three sought to gain support from the Hindu majority. The All India Scheduled Caste Federation bid for support from the ex-untouchable castes. Three of the four ethnic parties gradually disappeared because they were not able to obtain enough votes. In the late 1980s, the Congress began to decline. More non-congress parties started to challenge the Congress dominance. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) descended from the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. It attempted to pit Hindus against Muslims. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Janata Dal ( JD) tried to seek support from the Scheduled Castes, and Muslims against the upper castes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chandra|first=Kanchan|title=Ethnic Parties and Democratic Stability|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=235\u2013252|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050188|citeseerx=10.1.1.483.4574}}</ref>\n\nThe intense party competitions that started in the late 1970s have also weakened the influence of caste in Indian politics. Traditionally, Indian political parties have been constructed from top-down. Party leaders relied on preexisted patron-client networks to collect votes. Hence, no parties established fixed organisations to keep constant contacts with the village-level. Since 1977, the number of youth participating in politics has significantly increased. Due to the lack of fixed organisations, political parties had to rely on the young village members for political mobilisation.<ref name=\"Krishna 2003 1171\u20131193\">{{cite journal|last=Krishna|first=Anirudh|title=What is happening to Caste? A View from Some North Indian Villages|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|date=November 2003|volume=62|issue=4|pages=1171\u20131193|doi=10.2307/3591763|jstor=3591763}}</ref> Often, these young villagers exerted more political influence than the upper caste leaders and patrons. The status of these young people in the village depended on how much he could contribute to the economic development of the village. It is easier for the youth to maintain their status by rallying rather than remain loyal to a specific party. This also weakened the influence of caste and clientelism on Indian politics.\n\nIn the 1990s, many parties [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP), the [[Samajwadi Party]] and the [[Janata Dal]] started claiming that they were representing the backward castes. Many such parties, relying primarily on Backward Classes' support, often in alliance with Dalits and Muslims, rose to power in Indian states.<ref name=\"country_studies_caste\">{{cite web\n|title=Caste-Based Parties\n|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/116.htm\n|publisher= Country Studies US\n|accessdate=12 December 2006\n}}</ref> At the same time, many Dalit leaders and intellectuals started realising that the main Dalit oppressors were the so-called Other Backward Classes, and formed their own parties, such as the [[Indian Justice Party]]. The Congress (I) in Maharashtra long relied on OBCs' backing for its political success.<ref name=\"country_studies_caste\"/> [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has also showcased its Dalit and OBC leaders to prove that it is not an upper-caste party. [[Bangaru Laxman]], the former BJP president (2001\u20132002) was a former Dalit. [[Sanyasin]] [[Uma Bharati]], former CM of [[Madhya Pradesh]], who belongs to OBC caste, was a former BJP leader. In 2006 [[Arjun Singh (politician, born 1930)|Arjun Singh]] cabinet minister for MHRD of the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) government was accused of playing caste politics when he introduced reservations for OBCs in educational institutions all around.\n\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party rose to power promising representation of all castes in all important sectors of society.\n\n===Caste-based mobilisation===\nRecent evidence suggests that the influence of caste has been declining. Rather than a long-established, unchanging institution, caste is subject to political influence. Changes in political leadership throughout the history of India have led to changes in the structure of the caste system. India's colonial past has shaped caste into a flexible institution, generating a new system that has crucial influences on political mobilisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rao and Ban|title=The Political Construction of Caste in South India}}</ref> In some regions of India, strategic reconstructions of the caste system have taken place. For instance, the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] was first initiated by urban political entrepreneurs who belonged to the former lower caste groups.<ref name=\"Krishna 2003 1171\u20131193\"/> The pliable caste system in the post-independence era acts as a tool for identifying marginal groups and political mobilisation . Various political leaderships can alter and influence the caste system to give different groups of people unequal rights in accessing public services and political competition.\n\n===Education===\n{{further|Education in India}}\n\nEducation spread to the lower castes after India gained independence. The younger generations of all castes have had access to educational resources since the 1980s. The number of the Scheduled and [[Backward Castes]] people receiving education increased at a faster rate than that of the upper caste groups. The spread of education to all castes generated democratising effects. Some representatives of the SC and ST groups obtained access to Congress in the 1950s~1960s (1179). Due to their higher education levels, they are less likely to respond to the upper-caste patrons, but to the needs and interests of the lower castes.\n\n==Politically Important Castes==\n\n===Haryana===\n* [[Jats]] \n*[[Haryanvi]]([[Yadav]],[[Saini]],[[Gujjar]],[[Chamars]],Dalits,Baniya etc) >[[Punjabi Hindus]] (Khatris ,[[Arora|Aroras]], [[Kapoor|Kapoors]] etc)\n*[[Saini]] in [[Kurukshetra]],[[Yamuna Nagar]] and [[Ambala]]\n* [[Yadav]] in South Haryana\n*\n\n===Andhra Pradesh, Telangana===\n* [[Kamma (caste)|Kamma]]<ref name=\"Aditi_2009\"/> mostly in Guntur/Krishna/Prakasam and other coastal districts.

He is a mercenary and assassin who serves as the [[archenemy]] of the [[Teen Titans]], specifically [[Dick Grayson]]. Over the years, writers have developed him as an adversary of other [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Universe]] as well, such as [[Batman]] and [[Green Arrow]].\n\t\nDeathstroke has been ranked as the 24th Greatest Villain of All Time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine, and as the 32nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by [[IGN]].<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/32 | title=Deathstroke is number 32 | work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into other media, including several ''Batman''-related projects and the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]] in the latter and his solo animated series, ''[[Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons]]'', with his voice provided by [[Michael Chiklis]]. In live action, he has been portrayed by [[Manu Bennett]] on [[The CW]]'s [[television series]] ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and [[Esai Morales]] in the second season of [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''. [[Joe Manganiello]] portrayed the character in the [[DC Extended Universe]], beginning with a cameo in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]], the character was introduced as \"'''Deathstroke the Terminator'''\" in ''[[The New Teen Titans]]'' #2 in December 1980.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=85}}</ref> [[Christopher J.

I read that and went, \u201cWhoa\". This was beyond The Joker, well beyond Lex Luthor. Marv created the first modern supervillain.

The series was cancelled with issue #60. In total, ''Deathstroke'' ran for 65 issues (#1\u201360, plus four ''Annual''s and a special #0 issue).\n\nFollowing his injury in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', Deathstroke appears in one of the four ''[[Faces of Evil]]'' one-shots, written by [[David Hine]]. Hine has explained that the series is part of the set-up for future stories: \"All of the characters in this \u2018Faces of Evil\u2019 series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18794 | title=David Hine on Deathstroke's Return | last=Renaud | first=Jeffrey | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=November 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEven though the character of Deathstroke the Terminator predates [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[The Terminator]]'' by four years, the Slade Wilson character is now simply called Deathstroke, even by characters who had called him the Terminator for decades. The full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as ''[[Justice League Elite]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Deathstroke-DC-Comics.jpg|thumb|Slade Wilson as Deathstroke in ''Batman'' #646 (December 2005); art by Shane Davis]]\nSlade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the [[United States Army]], having lied about his age. After serving a stint in [[Korea]], he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain [[Adeline Kane]], who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in [[Vietnam]]. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in [[guerrilla warfare]]. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by [[Special Air Service|SAS]] member [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]], to whom he would later return the favor.\n\nChosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create [[metahuman]] super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]], who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Deathstroke the Terminator | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=97 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | place=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor.\n\nA criminal named [[Ravager (comics)|the Jackal]] took his younger son [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]] hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] and rendering him mute.\n\nAfter taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch to cover his eye.\n\n===The Teen Titans===\nSlade has a long history as an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the [[H.I.V.E.]], dubbed himself [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=109-110}}</ref> However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone. The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded [[Beast Boy]] in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.\n\nDeathstroke next appeared in New York, holding officials hostage in order to lure the Titans into confronting him. [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], a new ally of the Titans, and Beast Boy were the only ones available to answer the call. Terra knocked Beast Boy out and fought Deathstroke single-handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a Titan. Deathstroke escaped as the other Titans arrived, but by then Terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership. Later that night, it was revealed that Terra and Deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric |author2=George P\u00e9rez | title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George P\u00e9rez | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | page=128 | isbn=978-1-893905-25-2}}</ref>\n\n===The Judas Contract===\nThe Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. [[Donna Troy]] was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Koriand'r]] was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] was taken down by Terra herself. [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself. He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at [[Titans Tower]] to discover Slade's ex-wife and son. She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.\n\nNightwing, in order to confront Deathstroke and the [[H.I.V.E.]], joined [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] (Joseph Wilson). During the confrontation, Deathstroke recognized Jericho as his son, which caused him to hesitate. Jericho freed the Titans by possessing his father's body. After Terra died during the battle, Slade was then taken into custody.\n\nSlade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Changeling so that he could kill Slade himself, believing that he was responsible for Terra's betrayal of the Titans. Slade agreed to the confrontation, but showed up out of costume. Changeling found himself unable to kill Slade, so instead they talked. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Changeling realized that Slade was not to blame for the choices that Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms, with Slade returning to Africa with [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]].\n\n===Titans Plague===\nMonths later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. [[Donna Troy]] is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, [[Beast Boy|Gar Logan]] recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier. He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away. Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.\n\n===Titans Hunt===\nShortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the ''Titans Hunt'' storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the ''Judas Contract''. [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], an on-and-off member of the [[Doom Patrol]], hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]], and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.\n\nIt was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of [[Azarath]], as they were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho's true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho's heart, seemingly killing him.\n\nAfterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional ally to the Titans, aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry, most notably during the ''Total Chaos'' storyline when the [[Team Titans]] arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot [[Lord Chaos (DC Comics)|Lord Chaos]]. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former cop who would become the new [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. Pat Trayce became Slade's lover later on, and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship.\n\n===Family business===\n\nAfter Slade failed an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and [[Sarge Steel]], Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.\n\nMeanwhile, Slade's relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn, as Slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (but this power is limited, as Slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor). After gaining this power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This alteration of her DNA drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state.\n\nIn ''Titans'' (vol. 1) #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state had revived the H.I.V.E. and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho's apparent death. During the battle, interrupted by [[Vandal Savage]] and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titans battles, Adeline's throat was slit. In a brief return of sanity, she begged Slade to kill her, requesting him to reunite her with \"my... ''our'' children...\" because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound, but only allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand'r shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely, per Adeline's wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of Starfire's act.\n\nIt was then revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death. Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor and confidant Wintergreen. He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'s knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father's body. Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child [[Rose Wilson]] into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, in order to find and kill Jericho, using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge. Unfortunately, the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane, to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him.\n\n===''Nightwing'' and ''Birds of Prey''===\nDeathstroke appeared in ''[[Nightwing]]'' #23 as a mercenary against [[Black Canary]] and [[Conner Hawke]] as part of the \"Brotherhood of the Fist\" tie-in to the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc.<ref>''Nightwing'' #23</ref>\n\nDeathstroke also appeared in ''[[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]'' #22\u201324, where he was sent to [[Gorilla City]] by [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] to get an ape-heart. He is accompanied by [[Lady Vic]], Grimm, and Black Canary, who is posing as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]].\n\n===''Identity Crisis''===\nIn the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], who was being pursued by the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] as a suspect in the murder of [[Sue Dibny]]. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of [[Elongated Man]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Zatanna]], [[Hawkman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]]. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower. But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape. Near the end of ''Identity Crisis'', Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads \"''This is yours \u2013 we're not done.''\"\n\n===''Infinite Crisis''===\nDeathstroke was a founding member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. He was seen in ''Infinite Crisis'' #1, hiding in a warehouse south of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] waiting to ambush the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] with several other members. The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the [[Phantom Lady]]. Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death).<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nHe was the employer of Nightwing, whom he hired to train his daughter Rose. However, after the two had a confrontation with [[Superman]], Deathstroke discovered that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism. He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter, because doing so would undo all of Slade's teachings. Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the [[metahuman]] villains out of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]]. The deal held for 34 hours until ''Infinite Crisis'' #4, when Slade, under the orders of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the ''real'' leader of the Society, went with several villains (including old Titans and Doom Patrol foes and [[Brotherhood of Evil]] members [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|Brain]]) to drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals, on [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], killing over 100,000 people. Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again.\n\nNightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and Rose's training session, revealing to the latter that the [[kryptonite]] that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to [[Kryptonian]]s (as revealed by Luthor's old possession of a kryptonite ring that had forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body). Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him. Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him. Nightwing disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for Bl\u00fcdhaven.\n\nAt the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of ''Infinite Crisis'', Slade was confronted by [[Batman]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Nightwing. During the struggle, he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society. His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory; Batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor, and Nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him. Enraged, Slade said that was because of Nightwing, and that it was always because of him, before Batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious.\n\n===''One Year Later''===\n[[File:Titanseast.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Cover of ''Teen Titans'' #43: \"Titans East Part 1\". Art by [[Tony Daniel]].]]\nSlade appears in the ''Green Arrow'' series after the [[One Year Later|one year jump]] in DC Comics' storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #60 (May 2006)</ref>\n\nHowever, things do not quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, trapping him within a ring of armed [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' #62 (July 2006)</ref> The fight ends with Deathstroke's arrest<ref>''Green Arrow'' #63 (August 2006)</ref> and subsequent conviction and incarceration;<ref>''Green Arrow'' #64 (September 2006)</ref> however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to [[Constantine Drakon]], another jailed foe of Green Arrow who has information on the hero's activities in the lost year,<ref>''Green Arrow'' #65 (October 2006)</ref> which include Green Arrow studying under [[Natas (comics)|Natas]], an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #66 (November 2006)</ref>\n\nDeathstroke is also active behind the scenes in ''Teen Titans'', currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as [[Titans East]]. The current Titans team included Ravager, who now wanted nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke seemingly intended to \"reclaim\" Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that failed, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he specially selected each member of Titans East, believing that, overall, each member would successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up.\n\nAs indicated over the course of the subsequent issues, Deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He had blackmailed former Titan [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage; was drugging [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] with the same serum he had used on Rose; and supplied [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a formula which granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the [[Speed Force]] following the initial battle with [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]. His team, however, slowly fell apart over the course of the attack, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum and Raven convinced [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Slade and his remaining Titans subsequently faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he was defeated, he still managed to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it was revealed to the readers that Slade's real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them: a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans. By attacking the Titans, he insured that Rose and Jericho would become more trusted by their associates, and thus grow closer to the team.\n\nRecently, Deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting (through unknown means) the powers of [[Geo-Force]], the half-brother of the original Terra, into the same powers as his traitorous sister. Using this leverage, Deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if Geo-Force became his own personal spy within the Justice League. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, Geo-Force alerted Batman, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] of Deathstroke's scheme, which culminated in Geo-Force alerting the League that Deathstroke (whose rivalry with Green Arrow had reached vendetta-level proportions) planned on using an army of supervillains to crash Green Arrow and Black Canary's wedding. Weeks later, Geo-Force was tortured by [[Gorilla Grodd]] after the League was kidnapped by the [[Injustice League]], and ultimately transferred to Batman's newest incarnation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] afterward, robbing Deathstroke of his potential pawn.\n\nDeathstroke can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nDeathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by Geo-Force in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament''. Following his injury, he is recuperating at Belle Reve while doctors labor to save him. Deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down. When he awakens, he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past.\n\nRavager comes to visit him, but in fact, wants to finish her father off. She tries to strangle him with a plastic wire, but Deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack. He escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter. Later, Deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing.<ref>''Faces of Evil: Deathstroke''</ref>\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #77 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nThe two hopelessly fight the regenerating Black Lanterns until Jericho, cured from his earlier insanity, arrives and turns the tide of the fight. During the course of the battle, Deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the Teen Titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him, they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail. Just as Slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed, Jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the Black Lanterns and their [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power rings]], permanently sending them back to the grave. After realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive, and leaves after threatening to kill Slade if he tries to stop her. Jericho chooses to stay with his father, reasoning that only Slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #78 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman and Robin''===\nRecently, Deathstroke has been seen working with [[Talia al Ghul]], controlling the body and physical actions of the current [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] in order to kill the recent [[Dick Grayson|Batman]]. Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #9 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Titans: Villains for Hire''===\nFollowing the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of [[Tattooed Man]], [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and the new character Cinder following the launch of ''[[Brightest Day]]''. The team ambushes [[Ryan Choi]] in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar.<ref>''Titans: Villains for Hire Special'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nFollowing the assassination of the Atom, Deathstroke and the Titans are hired to kill Lex Luthor during his stay in Midway City. The attack is revealed to be a ruse crafted by Slade and Luthor in order to draw out a traitor on Luthor's security staff, who is revealed to be a shape-shifting assassin named Facade.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24\u201325</ref> After the Titans capture Facade and turn him over to the scientists at [[LexCorp]], Luthor rewards Slade by examining technology that he had earlier ordered Tattooed Man and Cheshire to steal. Slade claims that this will bring him one step closer to his true goal: the ability to somehow cheat death itself. He also succeeds in recruiting [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]], a former member of the Teen Titans and Justice League, into the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> Shortly after inducting Arsenal into the team, Slade accepts a mission to rescue a child from a drug lord named Elijah. After discovering that Elijah is using the bodies of kidnapped children to create an addictive drug called Bliss, the Titans promptly kill the gangster and shut down his operation. As the Titans are preparing to return to the Labyrinth, Cheshire notices that Slade has tied up DJ Molecule, a powerful metahuman who was working for Elijah as a bodyguard. When asked what he is doing with the young man, Slade cryptically responds by saying that he only accepted the mission in order capture Molecule for some unknown purpose.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #27</ref>\n\nAfterward, Slade and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader Drago over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Arsenal, and Cheshire betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago. While Slade is held captive, Drago arrives and reveals to him that he is actually Slade's old friend, Corporal Daniel Rogers, who abandoned him during the civil war in Afghanistan. Drago then gouges out Slade's left eye making him blind.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011)</ref> Slade is then imprisoned along with Arsenal and begins to tell him about his past with Drago.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011)</ref> Later, Drago takes a trip down memory lane with Slade, explaining how he lost his sight, and basically re-telling his origin and how it involved Jeremiah, right before he throws Slade beneath the complex to fend for his life against a crazed subhuman.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011)</ref> During the fights, Slade's left eye was restored due to his metahuman healing factor, and the Titans arrive to rescue him. Slade and the Titans break into Drago's mansion and attack. Slade drugs Drago so that he cannot focus his telepathic powers. When Drago is defeated, Slade allows him to live and the Titans then leave his island. While returning to the labyrinth, Slade and the Titans are approached by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and the Justice League, who attempt to arrest them for the murder of Ryan Choi.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #36 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nDuring the battle of Slade's Titans against the Justice League in [[Khandaq]], the battle was stopped by [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], who forces them to choose between leaving or continuing the fight and starting ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]''. The Justice League chose to retreat and Slade retrieves a sample of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]'s Kryptonian blood. Upon returning to the labyrinth, with his workers, [[Doctor Sivana]] and [[Doctor Impossible]], Slade reveals to the Titans that their efforts support creation of a diabolical invention called the \"Methuselah Device\" for his dying son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref>\n\nThe machine successfully heals Jericho, and Slade offers its abilities to all the Titans, offering to restore their deceased loved ones as payment for their services. All agree but Cinder, who does not want her brothers to live forever, as she claims to be doing. She attacks Cheshire and Osiris, and is then joined by Tattooed Man and Arsenal. As the Titans come to blows, Deathstroke attempts to take Jericho and leave, but Jericho, disgusted at what his father did to achieve his restoration, takes over his body, intending to destroy first the Methuselah Device, then himself and Deathstroke.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011)</ref> While the Titans fight over the Methuselah Device, its power source, a metahuman named DJ Molecule, is released. DJ Molecule blasts Slade, knocking Jericho out of his body. Arsenal then attacks him for stealing the Titans' legacy. Slade escapes and the Methuselah Device is destroyed by Cinder. Afterwards, Slade berates himself and becomes Deathstroke once more.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #1</ref> Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain [[Clayface]], Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode \u2013 namely the mask and knife belonging to his son [[Ravager (comics)|Grant]], both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #2</ref> During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #5</ref> Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him.\n\nSlade takes a contract from Harvest, to bring the [[Ravager (comics)|Ravagers]] back to the colony. He does this in exchange for his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. It turns out that [[John Lynch (comics)|Lynch]], the leader of [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] had needed Terra to stop a rampaging [[Mr. Majestic|Majestic]], who was thought to be killed by Dinah Drake's sonic scream. For a plan B, to Slade's dismay, he calls in [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]], now going by the name Jericho, with Adeline and Grant, to stop Majestic. Instead of stopping Majestic, Jericho takes control of Majestic, Adeline, Grant, and Terra in order to kill his father. Adeline dies, buried in the rubble caused by Majestic's stampede. Jericho momentarily loses control by this time, and Slade, Rose, and Terra manages to restrain Majestic, with the help of Rose's Gen-factor. However, Jericho retains control over Grant and Terra. When Slade knocks Terra unconscious, a cornered Jericho threatens to stab himself and Grant with a sword. Deathstroke, without hesitation, drives the sword into both of them, killing them instantly. But a later scene suggests Jericho has escaped, since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean-up scene, strongly implying Jericho has possessed the man to flee.\n\n====Origins====\nDeathstroke's altered origin is introduced in ''Deathstroke'' #0. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.\n\nThis origin was again changed in ''Teen Titans: Deathstroke'' #1. After a mission that involved destroying a children's hospital which Slade was unaware of, he quit the army. After Team 7's termination, Slade started to operate under the Deathstroke identity. He took Grant on his mission, considering him as not only his son, but as a business partner, and the only person he could trust. But during a mission in North Korea, their refuge was infiltrated and North Korean soldiers barged in, firing into the house. Grant was shot, and as Slade looked back at his son, a bullet penetrated his right eye, blinding it. Enraged, Slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers. However, Grant was presumed dead. Now, Slade works for the sake of his daughter Rose, as he knows the only thing that will keep Rose safe after he is gone is money. It is unclear if Rose's mother is Adeline or not.\n\n====Team 7====\nFive years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with ''Team 7''. With metahuman threats rising, ''The Majestic Project'', a plan to control future metahuman threats was devised by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the [[Eclipso]] Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center. [[Hank Henshaw|Dr. Henshaw]] is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including [[Caitlin Fairchild]]. Team 7 is sent to the spot. Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door. Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, [[Dinah Drake]], and [[Cole Cash]] had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch. Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected.\n\nTeam 7's last mission was to salvage Pandora's Box. The Team, with new pilot [[Steve Trevor]] is sent to Gamorra. The Kaizen, who possessed Pandora's Box, prepared to unleash its power. When they reach the Kaizen's palace, the child precogs show the Team a future where Kaizen Gamorra has opened the Box, and the whole world is going off the rails. Hearing the precogs say the Kaizen had to be stopped to prevent this fate, Majestic flies up into space, and impacts the coast of Gamorra with the force of a comet, creating a massive tidal wave, annihilating five million residents. But the Kaizen's palace stood however, and the team couldn't defeat him, until Majestic burst in. The Kaizen explains that Majestic is the key to opening the box, which also explains why he targeted Bronson in the first place. Majestic kills the Kaizen with a single blow. But he subdues to the Box's power, and starts attacking the team. Dinah lets out a canary cry that destroys the entire palace. In the chaos, Lynch is possessed by the box, but [[Amanda Waller]] knocks the box from his hands and tells Dinah to take the box away as far as possible. Lynch tries to take down the helicopter containing Dinah and the remaining team agents, but Waller shoots him from behind, seemingly killing Lynch and leading to Team 7's dissolution.\n\n====''Forever Evil''====\nDuring the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Shadow Thief]] at the White House when he is looking for the President.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1</ref> Later, the party turns up in [[Wayne Industries]] with [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]] to fight [[Batman]], [[Lex Luthor]], and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate. Deathstroke has Lex Luthor's life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth. Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him. After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #5</ref> Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate he is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower. The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed. Deathstroke witnesses the only \"hero\" from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities. Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor. He was also seen in the post-credit scenes of ''[[Justice League]]''.\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nIn ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Deathstroke, along with [[Lady Shiva]], is mentioned as one of the enemies that Batman thinks may be attacking him on [[Two-Face (comics)|Two-Face]]'s orders.<ref>''All-Star Batman'' #4</ref> He also stars in an ongoing series where he has a change of conscience and recruits a team of young superheroes to redeem his past misdeeds. In addition, he has come into contact with the African hero Red Lion/President Matthew Bland of Buredunia.<ref>''Deathstroke: Rebirth'' #1</ref> Bland offers him a high sum for making sure his competition was not bringing in US forces, in exchange for Slade's Ikon Suit made of [[Promethium]] for his own suit.<ref>''Deathstroke: Rebirth'' #4</ref> He attempts to save his son by using [[Speed Force]] energy off from [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]], but he was thwarted by both Titans and Teen Titans.

Deathstroke also possesses a regenerative healing factor that enables him to recover from physical injury much more rapidly than a normal human; it does, however, have its limits, as it could not heal his missing eye nor can it regenerate entire limbs. This enhanced endurance enables him to survive otherwise fatal injuries, though recovering from such injuries renders him temporarily insane and ferociously animalistic. In addition to being a military tactical genius with years of military experience, Deathstroke is an expert in many forms of unarmed combat and martial arts as well, serving as a master of [[Krav Maga]], [[Kung Fu]], [[B\u014djutsu]], [[Boxing]], [[Jojutsu]], [[Judo]], [[Jujitsu]], [[Karate]], and [[Ninjutsu]].\n\nDeathstroke is highly proficient in the use of various firearms and melee weapons. He typically wields a wide variety of swords, including katanas, giant broadswords, and volatile Promethium-forged swords that can redistribute copious amounts of energy from any source directed against them.<ref>''Batman: Arkham City Lockdown''</ref><ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 4 #8\">''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #8</ref> Deathstroke also utilizes a ballistic staff that fires energy blasts from both ends, though in more realism-focused versions, it fires bullets and miniature cannonball-like pellets instead. His staff can bend and stretch to adhere to his different martial art forms. Deathstroke's Promethium body armor is composed of a mesh-woven [[Kevlar]] chainlink [[Mail (armor)|mail]] capable of deflecting small arms fire. In ''The New 52'', this armor is meshed with Nth metal as well, allowing it to absorb blows from [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] and [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]], although it could not withstand the power of [[Mazahs]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>\n\nDeathstroke would eventually don the \"Ikon Suit\" (named after Slade's old friend, David Isherwood a.k.a. \"Dr. Ikon\", a war and spec-ops engineer <ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #2''</ref>), a prototype point defense gravity sheathe controlled by bodily gestures alongside EEG (Electroencephalography) leads in his mask.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> When a source of kinetic energy comes up against its protective shielding, a gravitational tidal effect occurs; a greater surface area causes a weaker defense shield, but a smaller surface area results in the sheathe being virtually indestructible.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #7</ref> However, the suit's programming can be manipulated by any other Ikon suit with the master programming, allowing one who wears a perfected Ikon Suit to activate or deactivate other Ikon suits at their discretion.<ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 4 #8\"/>\n\nDeathstroke has also briefly wielded a divinely forged sword, crafted by [[Hephaestus]], called \"The God Killer\".<ref>''DC Sneak Peek: Deathstroke (Digital)'' #1</ref> This sword can discharge vorpal shock-waves and redirect whatever force it is met with, and the primordial energy crackling within it enables it to shape-shift into a Bo Staff, Twin Swords, Cat-o-Nine tails, etc.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #8\u20139</ref><ref>''Deathstroke Annual'' Vol. 3 #1</ref><ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 3 #9\">''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> The sword is known to be semi-sentient and can be summoned to its owner via a mental link.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> This powerful weapon enabled Deathstroke to take on supernatural deities, a Kryptonian and a half-Amazon demigoddess.<ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 3 #9\"/> If broken, The God Killer sword can recreate itself from its scattered remains at will.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Earth One===\nIn ''[[Teen Titans: Earth One]]'' continuity, an unscarred Slade is a member of S.T.A.R.

At the same time, however, he proved skilled enough to defeat [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in a one-on-one fight despite the latter's superior physical strength.\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn [[Amalgam Comics]], Deathstroke is combined with Marvel's [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to become \"Dare the Terminator\", alias Slade Murdock. Unlike Wilson and Murdock, Dare is a woman. Though Dare is legally blind, she wears an eyepatch because of her mangled right eye. She also has horns surgically attached to her forehead. She uses a sword in combat.<ref>''Assassins'' #1 (April 1996)</ref>\n\nIn another comic, there is a Deathstroke amalgam called X-Stroke the Eliminator, who is a merging of Deathstroke and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: X#X-Cutioner|X-Cutioner]]. It is mentioned he is responsible for convincing Terra-X (amalgam of [[Terra (comics)|Tara Markov]] and [[Terrax]] and Dare's daughter) to betray the X-Patrol (an amalgam of [[X-Force]] and [[Doom Patrol]]).<ref>''The Exciting X-Patrol'' #1 (June 1997)</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn [[Tangent Comics]], Deathstroke is an armored supervillain and a member of the [[Fatal Five]].

Soon Deathstroke and Blitz were alerted that his crew were planning a mutiny. Deathstroke and Blitz fought and killed the treacherous crew, but Sonar manage to contact another pirate fleet under the leadership of the Caretaker before Deathstroke shot him. Later, Deathstroke and Jenny approaches the Caretaker's fleet and discovers Rose is being held captive. Deathstroke formulates a plan by offering to exchange Caretaker with a stasis-like Jenny for Rose's freedom. However, the Caretaker double-crosses on their deal and have his crew to attack him. But Deathstroke unleashes Jenny from her stasis upon Caretaker's fleet. During the battle, Deathstroke ignited a grenade at a weapon stockpile which destroyed Caretaker's ship and its crew with it. Deathstroke and Blitz were rescued by Rose. Reunited with his daughter, Deathstroke sails towards an unknown destination.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Superman: American Alien''===\nDeathstroke appears in ''Superman: American Alien'', where he was sent by [[Carmine Falcone]] to assassinate a young Bruce Wayne who is supposedly on a yacht party. However, like everyone else on the boat, he mistakes a young Clark Kent for Bruce and is surprised when the neurotoxin he put in Clark's drink just makes him dizzy instead of killing him. He tries cutting him up with his sword, but is further befuddled when the sword breaks over Clark's durable skin, and Clark simply flicks him off of the yacht to defeat him.<ref>''Superman: American Alien'' #3</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nDeathstroke appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'''s chapter 35 of Year Five, the last series before the game. The actions of the Regime has forced Deathstroke into early retirement, causing him to develop a grudge. Batman and [[Lex Luthor]] need a [[Mother Box]] located in S.T.A.R. Labs that will allow them to pull over doppelgangers from another universe to combat the Regime. Since Batman is the most wanted man on the planet, Deathstroke is the next best person to retrieve it, which he agrees to. He breaks into the facility and is easily able to fend off any soldiers standing guard. When he obtains the Mother Box, he is greeted by [[Metamorpho]] before he can leave. He is able to kill him after a tense fight and, realizing he will not get out with the Mother Box, uploads a blueprint of the device and sends it to Batman and Luthor so they can build it themselves. He is captured by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]. In Ground Zero, which adapts the events of the game, Deathstroke is saved and aids the Insurgency in taking over the Watchtower. When Luthor calls to inform him that he will be using the kryptonite gun on Superman, Deathstroke urges him to use it to kill so they can finally be free of the corrupt Kryptonian.\n\n==Collected editions==\nPart of the [[eponym]]ous series has been collected into a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n* ''Deathstroke, The Terminator: Full Cycle'' (collects ''Deathstroke, the Terminator'' #1\u20135 and ''New Titans'' #70, {{ISBNT|978-0-930289-82-9}})\n* ''Deathstroke, The Terminator Vol. 1: Assassins'' (''Deathstroke, the Terminator'' #1\u20139, ''New Titans'' #70 {{ISBNT|978-1401254285}})\n* ''Deathstroke, The Terminator Vol. 2: Sympathy For The Devil'' (''Deathstroke, the Terminator'' #10\u201313, ''Annual'' #1, ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #68 {{ISBNT|978-1401258429}})\n* ''Deathstroke, The Terminator Vol. 3: Nuclear Winter'' (''Deathstroke, the Terminator'' #14\u201320, ''Showcase '93'' #6\u201311 {{ISBNT| 978-1401260767}})\n* ''Deathstroke, The Terminator Vol. 4: Crash or Burn'' (''Deathstroke, the Terminator'' #21\u201325, ''Annual'' #2 {{ISBNT| 978-1401270834}})\n\n===''The New 52''===\n\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 1: Legacy'' (collects ''Deathstroke'' Vol. 2 #1\u20138, {{ISBNT|978-1-401234-81-2}})\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 2: Lobo Hunt'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 2 #0, #9\u201320)\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 1: Gods of War'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #1\u20136 {{ISBNT|978-1401254711}})\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 2: God Killer'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #7\u201310, ''Annual'' #1, ''Sneak Preview from Convergence: Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #2 {{ISBNT|978-1401261207}})\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 3: Suicide Run'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #11\u201316 {{ISBNT|978-1401264550}})\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 4: Family Business'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #17\u201320, ''Annual'' #2 {{ISBNT|978-1401267940}})\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\n\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 1: The Professional'' (''Deathstroke: Rebirth'' #1, ''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #1\u20135)\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 2: The Gospel of Slade'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #6\u201311)\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 3: Twilight'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #12\u201318)\n* ''Deathstroke vol. 4: Defiance'' (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #21\u201325)\n* ''Deathstroke Vol. 5: The Fall of Slade'' (Deathstroke Vol. 4 #26\u201329 and ''Annual'' #1)\n* ''Batman vs. Deathstroke''  (''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #30\u201335)\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====Animation====\n[[File:SladeTTanimated2003.jpg|thumb|160px|\"Slade\" in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series]]\n* The character appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. This incarnation simply goes by \"Slade\" as \"Deathstroke\" was not considered suitable for a show aimed at children. He is depicted as an enigmatic criminal mastermind rather than a mercenary/assassin, dispatching slews of supervillains and robot henchmen to eliminate the [[Teen Titans]]. After being killed by his apprentice, [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], Slade is resurrected as an undead powerful skeletal being by the demon [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], the father of Titans member [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], to aid in his conquest of Earth. Slade later betrays Trigon and temporarily aids the Titans in defeating him, reclaiming his life in the process before disappearing. An illusion of Slade torments Beast Boy about his failure to save Terra but is revealed to be a robot in the series finale.\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', initially voiced by [[Wentworth Miller]] in \"The Fix\" and by [[Fred Tatasciore]] onwards after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/16/sdcc-2012-kevin-smith-beware-the-batman-teen-titans-go-reveals-dc-nation-panel/ |title=MTV Geek \u2013 SDCC 2012: Kevin Smith Presents \u2018Beware the Batman\u2019 and \u2018Teen Titans Go!\u2019 Reveals at the DC Nation Panel |publisher=Geek-news.mtv.com |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115055/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/16/sdcc-2012-kevin-smith-beware-the-batman-teen-titans-go-reveals-dc-nation-panel/ |archivedate=February 17, 2013 }}</ref> He first appears in the season two episode \"True Colors\", during which he officially replaces [[Sportsmaster]] as [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]'s enforcer. He serves as [[Black Manta]]'s personal assassin for the remainder of the season. Deathstroke returns in season three having replaced [[Ra's al Ghul]] as a member of The Light and leader of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]]. Deathstroke and [[Lady Shiva]] forge an alliance with [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] to form a [[metahuman]] trafficking ring on the island of [[Santa Prisca]]. After Nightwing's Outsiders team seemingly frees the metahuman [[Terra (comics)|Princess Terra Markov]] from The Light's captivity, Terra is revealed to be a spy working for Deathstroke.\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version of Slade Wilson was originally a [[CIA]] agent who was terminated by his mentor [[Alfred Pennyworth]] for his ruthless methods. Slade then became the international assassin \"Deathstroke\", and is eventually hired by [[Anarky]] and [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] to kill Batman. Deathstroke accepts the contract in order to exact revenge on Pennyworth, who has since \"replaced\" him with Bruce Wayne as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Slade poses as \"Dane Lisslow\" for most of the program's run to get close to Bruce and Alfred, and ends up losing his right eye during a fight with Batman in the series finale.\n*Deathstroke (referred to as \"Slade\", similar to the original 2000s ''Teen Titans'' series) is alluded several times in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. His face can be seen on Robin's punching bag in several episodes, and he is indirectly mentioned by his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose Wilson / Ravager]] in the episode \"Cool School\", when she tells [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] that they both have father issues. Also, in the episode \"Terra-ized\", [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] is shown to have infiltrated the Titans Tower to steal the team's secrets for a greater villain, who is implied to be Slade. At the beginning of the episode \"The Return of Slade\", the Titans build up the hype for their upcoming battle with Slade, but the entire event ultimately takes place off-screen. Slade's only physical appearance in the series is briefly at the end of the episode \"The Titans Show\", where he is seen among the other major villains from the DC Universe summoned by Control Freak to fight the Titans (with the episode ending before the actual battle).\n* In May 2019, [[The CW]] announced the animated series ''[[Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons]]'' for their CW Seed platform.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title='Deathstroke' Animated Series, 'The Pledge' Horror Series In Works At CW Seed |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/deathstroke-animated-series-the-pledge-series-cw-seed-1202616395/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=May 16, 2019 |language=en |date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> The series premiered in the first quarter of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/deathstroke-cw-seed-animated-series-voice-cast-teaser-trailer/|title=Deathstroke Animated Series Announces Voice Cast with Bloody Teaser Trailer|author=Tim Adams|website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=October 4, 2019|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> [[Michael Chiklis]] provided the voice for the character.<ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/47269-michael-chiklis-to-voice-deathstroke-in-cw-seed-series.html]</ref>\n*Deathstroke appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[D.

Former scientist, '''Earl Gregg''' is involved in an accident in the lab exposed him to magnetic particles, permanently altering his body and granting him magnetic powers. His assistant, who afterwards becomes his wife, helps by creating a special suit to contain his powers and keep metal from being drawn to him while out in public. The suit even has a symbol of its own: resembling the force lines of a magnetic field, forming a stylized figure eight. After this, he becomes an assassin, murdering his targets with his powers, first by drawing the target to him, then by magnetizing the iron in their blood cells, causing a figure-eight mark on the chest as the person dies of a heart attack. The couple take the name Bob and Carol Stanford when they arrive in Metropolis; they become friends with Clark Kent and Lois Lane as they discover that Lois is going to be interviewing Grant Gendell, an eccentric reclusive billionaire. The couple plan to assassinate Gendell before he goes public, taking his identity and thus his fortune. The plan is foiled when Superman interferes, destroying Deathstroke's containment suit, which causes him to be magnetically drawn to a steel pillar until the police arrive. Very much like Superman, Deathstroke kept a secret identity by wearing a pair of glasses.\n* Slade Wilson appears in the tenth season of ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by [[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]] in the episode \"Patriot\". This version is a [[United States Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] and a suspected war criminal behind the anti-superhero Vigilante Registration Act legislation. After his capture of [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Green Arrow/Oliver Queen]], [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] failed, he is cornered by Clark Kent, who destroys the facility. Slade (who is revealed to be branded with the Omega-Symbol via X-Ray vision) is later saved from death by [[Darkseid]] and advanced military technology, losing his right eye but gaining healing abilities in the process (rendering him \"beyond Death's stroke\"). In the episode \"Icarus\", he arranges for the [[Justice League (Smallville)|League]]'s allies [[Emil Hamilton]], [[Tess Mercer]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] to be arrested and taken into VRA headquarters, and attempts to murder Lois in [[LuthorCorp]] Tower. He later impales [[Hawkman]] fatally who falls to his death saving Lois from an explosion and is sent to the [[Phantom Zone]] by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] soon after. In the episode \"Dominion\", he is later released from the Zone and placed in a coma by a merged [[General Zod|Zod]] using him as bait to lure Clark.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | width1    = 167\n | width2    = 181\n | image1    = Arrow Billy Wintergreen.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Jeffery C.

His Deathstroke outfit is the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] wear, as members of the unit [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] wear dark grey uniforms with black and orange bi-colored balaclavas.\n** [[Manu Bennett]] portrays [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]] himself on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' initially to search to extract ex-Chinese military [[Yao Fei (Arrowverse)|Yao Fei]]. Throughout the [[Arrow (season 1)|first]] and [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] seasons' flashbacks, Slade trains marooned playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] in combat while they are on the island of [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], beginning Queen's path in becoming a vigilante, even stopping Fyers and former friend Billy Wintergreen in the season one finale. In season two, a mortally wounded Slade later gains superhuman strength and reflexes when he takes the \"mirakuru\" supersoldier formula. The serum drives Slade insane and eventually causes him to despise Oliver when [[Anthony Ivo (Arrowverse)|Dr. Anthony Ivo]] kills [[Shado (Arrowverse)|Shado]], Oliver's girlfriend, whom Slade was in love with. Upon taking the [[Amazo|ship]] and killing Ivo, Oliver and [[Sara Lance]] decide to kill Slade with Oliver forced to drive an arrow through Slade's right eye in an attempt to kill him. In season two's present day narrative, Slade returns as the terrorist mercenary known as \"Deathstroke\" and wreaks havoc on Oliver's life, killing his mother [[Moira Queen (Arrowverse)|Moira]] and overwhelming Starling City with mirakuru-enhanced soldiers sporting gray ASIS unit masks. In addition, he hires [[Isabel Rochev]] to act as his [[Ravager (comics)|prodigy]] and positioned [[Sebastian Blood (Arrowverse)|Sebastian Blood]] as the mayor up to his betrayal and her death. In the season finale, Oliver defeats Slade and cures him of his powers before imprisoning him in an [[A.R.G.U.S. (Arrowverse)|A.R.G.U.S.]] prison on Lian Yu. In the [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]] episode \"The Return\", Slade escapes his underground confinement and torments Oliver and his sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] during their training session on Lian Yu, though he is ultimately recaptured. Deathstroke is briefly seen in the [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]] episode \"Genesis\" as a vision in Oliver's mind, and reappears in the show's [[Invasion! (Arrow)|100th episode]] as a [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominator]]-induced hallucination. Slade returns in the final two episodes of the [[Arrow (season 5)|fifth season]], helping Oliver and his army of former enemies to release his allies and fight against [[Prometheus (Arrowverse)|Prometheus]]'s forces. In the [[Arrow (season 6)|sixth season]], Slade appears in \"Fallout\", \"Deathstroke Returns\" and \"Promises Kept\", during which Slade attempts to track down his son [[Joe Wilson (Arrowverse)|Joe]].\n** '''[[Grant Wilson (Arrowverse)|Grant Wilson]]''' (portrayed by Jamie Andrew Cutler) appears in the episode \"Star City 2046\" of the ''Arrow'' spin-off show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. As Slade's son, he takes up the Deathstroke mantle and continues his father's legacy in the year 2046. He is eventually defeated by [[Legends of Tomorrow (team)|Legends]], [[Connor Hawke (Arrowverse Earth-16)|Connor Hawke]] and an older Oliver Queen. His name is mentioned in ''Arrow'' episode \"Promises Kept\", where his brother Joe reveals his existence to his father Slade. Grant's suit has a black-and-gray helmet as opposed to black-and-orange. Grant Wilson appears in the episode \"Present Tense\" portrayed again by Jamie Andrew Cutler. He becomes the latest Deathstroke and leads an earlier version of the Deathstroke Gang in order to follow in his father's footsteps. At the time when they were brought to the present, [[Mia Smoak]], [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], and William Clayton at first mistook him for a time-displaced John Diggle Jr. when they arrive at where the Deathstroke Gang had their hideout in 2040. After Green Arrow rescues them from a motion-activated bomb trap, William and Connor came clean about the bad parts of 2040 which included Grant Wilson training John Diggle Jr. to be his apprentice as well as Zoe Ramirez's death which left John Diggle and Rene Ramirez devastated. When it came to the Deathstroke Gang's planned attack, Team Arrow and Future Team Arrow took the battle to three different fronts.

Later, Slade arrives at [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne Tech]] to infuse the stolen crystal's power, but the Titans arrive once again to stop him and manage to secure the crystal, although Slade escapes. Later, Slade continues to act as part of his plan to keep all the heroes distracted while he invaded their cities to build D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y., a device powered by the stolen crystal that can control minds and allow him to conquer the world. Slade then blows up the Titans Tower, leaving Robin to perish in the explosion, and takes over the minds of all the superheroes attending the premiere of his new movie about Robin, but the Titans ultimately foil his scheme, defeating Slade and his giant robot armor, and liberating all the heroes from his mind control. A recurring joke in the film is the Titans mistaking Slade for [[Deadpool]], which annoys him, as Deathstroke was introduced in comics first.\n\n=====DC Animated Movie Universe=====\n[[File:AnimatedMovieDeathstroke.jpg|thumb|right|Deathstroke's character design in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]].]]\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' (2013), voiced again by [[Ron Perlman]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|title=UPDATE: FLASHPOINT PARADOX Reveals Reverse Flash, Director|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/dc-animated-flashpoint-paradox-news.html|publisher=Newsarama}}</ref> In the [[Flashpoint (comics)|altered reality]] inadvertently created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], Deathstroke is the captain of a ship called ''The Ravager''.

Sub-Zero wins the battle, but does not bother finishing off Deathstroke fearing the essence of the Netherrealm that leads to Scorpion would become too weak to follow if he wasted any more time. Later, Deathstroke teams up with [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. He helps Joker try to take on [[Sonya Blade]] and [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]. Joker fights Sonya while Deathstroke battles Kano. In the middle of his fight, Deathstroke is pushed aside by Joker who defeats Kano and turns on Deathstroke when the Combat Rage takes over Joker. Deathstroke's game ending has him realizing that other-worldly assassins are seen as unwelcome competition. As a caution, he creates an army of assassins in his image, becoming the leader of the \"Deathstrike Clan\" (the DC Universe's version of the [[Lin Kuei]]).\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Tracy W.

In Deathstroke's ending, new governments start to form to replace Superman's. With new governments comes new orders for assassinations, insurrections to cause and revolutions to support, too much for even Deathstroke to handle.

He is a mercenary and assassin who serves as the [[archenemy]] of the [[Teen Titans]], specifically [[Dick Grayson]]. Over the years, writers have developed him as an adversary of other [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Universe]] as well, such as [[Batman]] and [[Green Arrow]].\n\t\nDeathstroke has been ranked as the 24th Greatest Villain of All Time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine, and as the 32nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by [[IGN]].<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/32 | title=Deathstroke is number 32 | work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into other media, including several ''Batman''-related projects and the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]] in the latter and his solo animated series, ''[[Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons]]'', with his voice provided by [[Michael Chiklis]]. In live action, he has been portrayed by [[Manu Bennett]] on [[The CW]]'s [[television series]] ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and [[Esai Morales]] in the second season of [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''. [[Joe Manganiello]] portrayed the character in the [[DC Extended Universe]], beginning with a cameo in the 2017 film ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]], the character was introduced as \"'''Deathstroke the Terminator'''\" in ''[[The New Teen Titans]]'' #2 in December 1980.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=85}}</ref> [[Christopher J.

The series was cancelled with issue #60. In total, ''Deathstroke'' ran for 65 issues (#1\u201360, plus four ''Annual''s and a special #0 issue).\n\nFollowing his injury in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', Deathstroke appears in one of the four ''[[Faces of Evil]]'' one-shots, written by [[David Hine]]. Hine has explained that the series is part of the set-up for future stories: \"All of the characters in this \u2018Faces of Evil\u2019 series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18794 | title=David Hine on Deathstroke's Return | last=Renaud | first=Jeffrey | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=November 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEven though the character of Deathstroke the Terminator predates [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[The Terminator]]'' by four years, the Slade Wilson character is now simply called Deathstroke, even by characters who had called him the Terminator for decades. The full title has not completely fallen out of use, having been referenced as recently as ''[[Justice League Elite]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Deathstroke-DC-Comics.jpg|thumb|Slade Wilson as Deathstroke in ''Batman'' #646 (December 2005); art by Shane Davis]]\nSlade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the [[United States Army]], having lied about his age. After serving a stint in [[Korea]], he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain [[Adeline Kane]], who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in [[Vietnam]]. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in [[guerrilla warfare]]. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by [[Special Air Service|SAS]] member [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]], to whom he would later return the favor.\n\nChosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create [[metahuman]] super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]], who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge.<ref name=\"dc-ency\">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Deathstroke the Terminator | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=97 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | place=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor.\n\nA criminal named [[Ravager (comics)|the Jackal]] took his younger son [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]] hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] and rendering him mute.\n\nAfter taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch to cover his eye.\n\n===The Teen Titans===\nSlade has a long history as an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the [[H.I.V.E.]], dubbed himself [[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]], and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=109-110}}</ref> However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone. The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded [[Beast Boy]] in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.\n\nDeathstroke next appeared in New York, holding officials hostage in order to lure the Titans into confronting him. [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], a new ally of the Titans, and Beast Boy were the only ones available to answer the call. Terra knocked Beast Boy out and fought Deathstroke single-handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a Titan. Deathstroke escaped as the other Titans arrived, but by then Terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership. Later that night, it was revealed that Terra and Deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric |author2=George P\u00e9rez | title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George P\u00e9rez | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | page=128 | isbn=978-1-893905-25-2}}</ref>\n\n===The Judas Contract===\nThe Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. [[Donna Troy]] was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]] was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Koriand'r]] was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] was taken down by Terra herself. [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself. He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at [[Titans Tower]] to discover Slade's ex-wife and son. She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.\n\nNightwing, in order to confront Deathstroke and the [[H.I.V.E.]], joined [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] (Joseph Wilson). During the confrontation, Deathstroke recognized Jericho as his son, which caused him to hesitate. Jericho freed the Titans by possessing his father's body. After Terra died during the battle, Slade was then taken into custody.\n\nSlade was put on trial for his crimes, but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by Changeling so that he could kill Slade himself, believing that he was responsible for Terra's betrayal of the Titans. Slade agreed to the confrontation, but showed up out of costume. Changeling found himself unable to kill Slade, so instead they talked. Feeling some empathy for his grief, Slade explained his past with Terra, and Changeling realized that Slade was not to blame for the choices that Terra had made. The two men parted on peaceful terms, with Slade returning to Africa with [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]].\n\n===Titans Plague===\nMonths later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. [[Donna Troy]] is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, [[Beast Boy|Gar Logan]] recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier. He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away. Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.\n\n===Titans Hunt===\nShortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the ''Titans Hunt'' storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the ''Judas Contract''. [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], an on-and-off member of the [[Doom Patrol]], hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]], and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.\n\nIt was revealed that Jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of [[Azarath]], as they were using him to capture the Titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive. During the transfer process, Jericho's true self resurfaced briefly, begging his father to kill him. To spare his son any more pain and save the remaining Titans, Slade was forced to drive a sword through Jericho's heart, seemingly killing him.\n\nAfterward, Slade continued his life as a mercenary, but also acted as an occasional ally to the Titans, aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry, most notably during the ''Total Chaos'' storyline when the [[Team Titans]] arrived in the 20th Century to assassinate Donna Troy before she could give birth to her son, who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot [[Lord Chaos (DC Comics)|Lord Chaos]]. Slade also met Pat Trayce, a tough former cop who would become the new [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. Pat Trayce became Slade's lover later on, and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship.\n\n===Family business===\n\nAfter Slade failed an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S. Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and [[Sarge Steel]], Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.\n\nMeanwhile, Slade's relationship with his estranged wife Adeline took a tragic turn, as Slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration, allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact (but this power is limited, as Slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor). After gaining this power, Slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life, resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality. This alteration of her DNA drove Adeline insane, shaming Deathstroke into going into a semi-retirement state.\n\nIn ''Titans'' (vol. 1) #12, Deathstroke teamed up with the Titans to face his wife Adeline, who in her insane state had revived the H.I.V.E. and sought to rid the world of all superhumans, blaming them for Jericho's apparent death. During the battle, interrupted by [[Vandal Savage]] and a band of villains that he had organized from recent Titans battles, Adeline's throat was slit. In a brief return of sanity, she begged Slade to kill her, requesting him to reunite her with \"my... ''our'' children...\" because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound, but only allow her to live in spite of it. Deathstroke refused, but Koriand'r shocked her teammates and Deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely, per Adeline's wishes. This was a turning point, as Deathstroke renounced all ties with the Titans as a result of Starfire's act.\n\nIt was then revealed that Jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into Deathstroke in the instant before his death. Taking control of his father, Jericho forced Deathstroke to murder his longtime butler, mentor and confidant Wintergreen. He then launched a series of attacks against the current Teen Titans, most notably shattering [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'s knee with a shotgun blast, before leaving his father's body. Deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child [[Rose Wilson]] into the mercenary business as the new Ravager, in order to find and kill Jericho, using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge. Unfortunately, the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane, to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him.\n\n===''Nightwing'' and ''Birds of Prey''===\nDeathstroke appeared in ''[[Nightwing]]'' #23 as a mercenary against [[Black Canary]] and [[Conner Hawke]] as part of the \"Brotherhood of the Fist\" tie-in to the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' story arc.<ref>''Nightwing'' #23</ref>\n\nDeathstroke also appeared in ''[[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]'' #22\u201324, where he was sent to [[Gorilla City]] by [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] to get an ape-heart. He is accompanied by [[Lady Vic]], Grimm, and Black Canary, who is posing as [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]].\n\n===''Identity Crisis''===\nIn the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], who was being pursued by the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] as a suspect in the murder of [[Sue Dibny]]. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of [[Elongated Man]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Zatanna]], [[Hawkman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]]. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower. But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape. Near the end of ''Identity Crisis'', Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads \"''This is yours \u2013 we're not done.''\"\n\n===''Infinite Crisis''===\nDeathstroke was a founding member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. He was seen in ''Infinite Crisis'' #1, hiding in a warehouse south of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] waiting to ambush the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] with several other members. The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the [[Phantom Lady]]. Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death).<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nHe was the employer of Nightwing, whom he hired to train his daughter Rose. However, after the two had a confrontation with [[Superman]], Deathstroke discovered that Nightwing had been teaching Rose the values of heroism. He could not kill Grayson in front of his daughter, because doing so would undo all of Slade's teachings. Nightwing offered a deal: he would stay away from Rose if Slade would keep the [[metahuman]] villains out of [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]]. The deal held for 34 hours until ''Infinite Crisis'' #4, when Slade, under the orders of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], the ''real'' leader of the Society, went with several villains (including old Titans and Doom Patrol foes and [[Brotherhood of Evil]] members [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|Brain]]) to drop [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals, on [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], killing over 100,000 people. Slade gave the explanation to the Brotherhood that Nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again.\n\nNightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on Deathstroke and Rose's training session, revealing to the latter that the [[kryptonite]] that Deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to [[Kryptonian]]s (as revealed by Luthor's old possession of a kryptonite ring that had forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body). Angered, Slade went after Nightwing with a grenade, only to have Rose try to stop him. Amid the smoke of the resulting explosion, Rose fled, telling her father that she hated him. Nightwing disappeared as well, but not before leaving a note for Slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for Bl\u00fcdhaven.\n\nAt the climactic Battle of Metropolis at the conclusion of ''Infinite Crisis'', Slade was confronted by [[Batman]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and Nightwing. During the struggle, he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the Secret Society. His claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory; Batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor, and Nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him. Enraged, Slade said that was because of Nightwing, and that it was always because of him, before Batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious.\n\n===''One Year Later''===\n[[File:Titanseast.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Cover of ''Teen Titans'' #43: \"Titans East Part 1\". Art by [[Tony Daniel]].]]\nSlade appears in the ''Green Arrow'' series after the [[One Year Later|one year jump]] in DC Comics' storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #60 (May 2006)</ref>\n\nHowever, things do not quite go according to plan, with Green Arrow using the resources of both his identities, trapping him within a ring of armed [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]].<ref>''Green Arrow'' #62 (July 2006)</ref> The fight ends with Deathstroke's arrest<ref>''Green Arrow'' #63 (August 2006)</ref> and subsequent conviction and incarceration;<ref>''Green Arrow'' #64 (September 2006)</ref> however, this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to [[Constantine Drakon]], another jailed foe of Green Arrow who has information on the hero's activities in the lost year,<ref>''Green Arrow'' #65 (October 2006)</ref> which include Green Arrow studying under [[Natas (comics)|Natas]], an assassin who once trained Deathstroke himself.<ref>''Green Arrow'' #66 (November 2006)</ref>\n\nDeathstroke is also active behind the scenes in ''Teen Titans'', currently in the process of organizing a counter-team of teen superhumans that will be known as [[Titans East]]. The current Titans team included Ravager, who now wanted nothing to do with her father. Deathstroke seemingly intended to \"reclaim\" Ravager and a recently resurrected Jericho from the Titans or, if that failed, to crush them along with the rest of the team. For these reasons, he specially selected each member of Titans East, believing that, overall, each member would successfully counteract every member of the current Teen Titans line-up.\n\nAs indicated over the course of the subsequent issues, Deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another. He had blackmailed former Titan [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage; was drugging [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] with the same serum he had used on Rose; and supplied [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a formula which granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the [[Speed Force]] following the initial battle with [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]]. His team, however, slowly fell apart over the course of the attack, as Robin managed to free Batgirl of his mind control serum and Raven convinced [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Slade and his remaining Titans subsequently faced off against both the current Titans and a group of old Titans led by Nightwing. Although he was defeated, he still managed to escape with the aid of Inertia. In the end, however, it was revealed to the readers that Slade's real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them: a real family, in the form of the Teen Titans. By attacking the Titans, he insured that Rose and Jericho would become more trusted by their associates, and thus grow closer to the team.\n\nRecently, Deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting (through unknown means) the powers of [[Geo-Force]], the half-brother of the original Terra, into the same powers as his traitorous sister. Using this leverage, Deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if Geo-Force became his own personal spy within the Justice League. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, Geo-Force alerted Batman, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] of Deathstroke's scheme, which culminated in Geo-Force alerting the League that Deathstroke (whose rivalry with Green Arrow had reached vendetta-level proportions) planned on using an army of supervillains to crash Green Arrow and Black Canary's wedding. Weeks later, Geo-Force was tortured by [[Gorilla Grodd]] after the League was kidnapped by the [[Injustice League]], and ultimately transferred to Batman's newest incarnation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] afterward, robbing Deathstroke of his potential pawn.\n\nDeathstroke can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nDeathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by Geo-Force in ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament''. Following his injury, he is recuperating at Belle Reve while doctors labor to save him. Deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down. When he awakens, he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past.\n\nRavager comes to visit him, but in fact, wants to finish her father off. She tries to strangle him with a plastic wire, but Deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack. He escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter. Later, Deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing.<ref>''Faces of Evil: Deathstroke''</ref>\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]]. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #77 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nThe two hopelessly fight the regenerating Black Lanterns until Jericho, cured from his earlier insanity, arrives and turns the tide of the fight. During the course of the battle, Deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the Teen Titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him, they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail. Just as Slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed, Jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the Black Lanterns and their [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power rings]], permanently sending them back to the grave. After realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive, and leaves after threatening to kill Slade if he tries to stop her. Jericho chooses to stay with his father, reasoning that only Slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #78 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman and Robin''===\nRecently, Deathstroke has been seen working with [[Talia al Ghul]], controlling the body and physical actions of the current [[Damian Wayne|Robin]] in order to kill the recent [[Dick Grayson|Batman]]. Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #9 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Titans: Villains for Hire''===\nFollowing the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of [[Tattooed Man]], [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], and the new character Cinder following the launch of ''[[Brightest Day]]''. The team ambushes [[Ryan Choi]] in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar.<ref>''Titans: Villains for Hire Special'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nFollowing the assassination of the Atom, Deathstroke and the Titans are hired to kill Lex Luthor during his stay in Midway City. The attack is revealed to be a ruse crafted by Slade and Luthor in order to draw out a traitor on Luthor's security staff, who is revealed to be a shape-shifting assassin named Facade.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24\u201325</ref> After the Titans capture Facade and turn him over to the scientists at [[LexCorp]], Luthor rewards Slade by examining technology that he had earlier ordered Tattooed Man and Cheshire to steal. Slade claims that this will bring him one step closer to his true goal: the ability to somehow cheat death itself. He also succeeds in recruiting [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]], a former member of the Teen Titans and Justice League, into the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> Shortly after inducting Arsenal into the team, Slade accepts a mission to rescue a child from a drug lord named Elijah. After discovering that Elijah is using the bodies of kidnapped children to create an addictive drug called Bliss, the Titans promptly kill the gangster and shut down his operation. As the Titans are preparing to return to the Labyrinth, Cheshire notices that Slade has tied up DJ Molecule, a powerful metahuman who was working for Elijah as a bodyguard. When asked what he is doing with the young man, Slade cryptically responds by saying that he only accepted the mission in order capture Molecule for some unknown purpose.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #27</ref>\n\nAfterward, Slade and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader Drago over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Arsenal, and Cheshire betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago. While Slade is held captive, Drago arrives and reveals to him that he is actually Slade's old friend, Corporal Daniel Rogers, who abandoned him during the civil war in Afghanistan. Drago then gouges out Slade's left eye making him blind.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011)</ref> Slade is then imprisoned along with Arsenal and begins to tell him about his past with Drago.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011)</ref> Later, Drago takes a trip down memory lane with Slade, explaining how he lost his sight, and basically re-telling his origin and how it involved Jeremiah, right before he throws Slade beneath the complex to fend for his life against a crazed subhuman.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011)</ref> During the fights, Slade's left eye was restored due to his metahuman healing factor, and the Titans arrive to rescue him. Slade and the Titans break into Drago's mansion and attack. Slade drugs Drago so that he cannot focus his telepathic powers. When Drago is defeated, Slade allows him to live and the Titans then leave his island. While returning to the labyrinth, Slade and the Titans are approached by the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] and the Justice League, who attempt to arrest them for the murder of Ryan Choi.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #36 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nDuring the battle of Slade's Titans against the Justice League in [[Khandaq]], the battle was stopped by [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], who forces them to choose between leaving or continuing the fight and starting ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]''. The Justice League chose to retreat and Slade retrieves a sample of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]'s Kryptonian blood. Upon returning to the labyrinth, with his workers, [[Doctor Sivana]] and [[Doctor Impossible]], Slade reveals to the Titans that their efforts support creation of a diabolical invention called the \"Methuselah Device\" for his dying son [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref>\n\nThe machine successfully heals Jericho, and Slade offers its abilities to all the Titans, offering to restore their deceased loved ones as payment for their services. All agree but Cinder, who does not want her brothers to live forever, as she claims to be doing. She attacks Cheshire and Osiris, and is then joined by Tattooed Man and Arsenal. As the Titans come to blows, Deathstroke attempts to take Jericho and leave, but Jericho, disgusted at what his father did to achieve his restoration, takes over his body, intending to destroy first the Methuselah Device, then himself and Deathstroke.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011)</ref> While the Titans fight over the Methuselah Device, its power source, a metahuman named DJ Molecule, is released. DJ Molecule blasts Slade, knocking Jericho out of his body. Arsenal then attacks him for stealing the Titans' legacy. Slade escapes and the Methuselah Device is destroyed by Cinder. Afterwards, Slade berates himself and becomes Deathstroke once more.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #1</ref> Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain [[Clayface]], Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode \u2013 namely the mask and knife belonging to his son [[Ravager (comics)|Grant]], both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #2</ref> During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #5</ref> Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again and again. It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant. It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him.\n\nSlade takes a contract from Harvest, to bring the [[Ravager (comics)|Ravagers]] back to the colony. He does this in exchange for his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]. It turns out that [[John Lynch (comics)|Lynch]], the leader of [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] had needed Terra to stop a rampaging [[Mr. Majestic|Majestic]], who was thought to be killed by Dinah Drake's sonic scream. For a plan B, to Slade's dismay, he calls in [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph Wilson]], now going by the name Jericho, with Adeline and Grant, to stop Majestic. Instead of stopping Majestic, Jericho takes control of Majestic, Adeline, Grant, and Terra in order to kill his father. Adeline dies, buried in the rubble caused by Majestic's stampede. Jericho momentarily loses control by this time, and Slade, Rose, and Terra manages to restrain Majestic, with the help of Rose's Gen-factor. However, Jericho retains control over Grant and Terra. When Slade knocks Terra unconscious, a cornered Jericho threatens to stab himself and Grant with a sword. Deathstroke, without hesitation, drives the sword into both of them, killing them instantly. But a later scene suggests Jericho has escaped, since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean-up scene, strongly implying Jericho has possessed the man to flee.\n\n====Origins====\nDeathstroke's altered origin is introduced in ''Deathstroke'' #0. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.\n\nThis origin was again changed in ''Teen Titans: Deathstroke'' #1. After a mission that involved destroying a children's hospital which Slade was unaware of, he quit the army. After Team 7's termination, Slade started to operate under the Deathstroke identity. He took Grant on his mission, considering him as not only his son, but as a business partner, and the only person he could trust. But during a mission in North Korea, their refuge was infiltrated and North Korean soldiers barged in, firing into the house. Grant was shot, and as Slade looked back at his son, a bullet penetrated his right eye, blinding it. Enraged, Slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers. However, Grant was presumed dead. Now, Slade works for the sake of his daughter Rose, as he knows the only thing that will keep Rose safe after he is gone is money. It is unclear if Rose's mother is Adeline or not.\n\n====Team 7====\nFive years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with ''Team 7''. With metahuman threats rising, ''The Majestic Project'', a plan to control future metahuman threats was devised by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the [[Eclipso]] Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center. [[Hank Henshaw|Dr. Henshaw]] is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including [[Caitlin Fairchild]]. Team 7 is sent to the spot. Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door. Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, [[Dinah Drake]], and [[Cole Cash]] had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch. Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected.\n\nTeam 7's last mission was to salvage Pandora's Box. The Team, with new pilot [[Steve Trevor]] is sent to Gamorra. The Kaizen, who possessed Pandora's Box, prepared to unleash its power. When they reach the Kaizen's palace, the child precogs show the Team a future where Kaizen Gamorra has opened the Box, and the whole world is going off the rails. Hearing the precogs say the Kaizen had to be stopped to prevent this fate, Majestic flies up into space, and impacts the coast of Gamorra with the force of a comet, creating a massive tidal wave, annihilating five million residents. But the Kaizen's palace stood however, and the team couldn't defeat him, until Majestic burst in. The Kaizen explains that Majestic is the key to opening the box, which also explains why he targeted Bronson in the first place. Majestic kills the Kaizen with a single blow. But he subdues to the Box's power, and starts attacking the team. Dinah lets out a canary cry that destroys the entire palace. In the chaos, Lynch is possessed by the box, but [[Amanda Waller]] knocks the box from his hands and tells Dinah to take the box away as far as possible. Lynch tries to take down the helicopter containing Dinah and the remaining team agents, but Waller shoots him from behind, seemingly killing Lynch and leading to Team 7's dissolution.\n\n====''Forever Evil''====\nDuring the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], and [[Shadow Thief]] at the White House when he is looking for the President.<ref>''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #1</ref> Later, the party turns up in [[Wayne Industries]] with [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]] to fight [[Batman]], [[Lex Luthor]], and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate. Deathstroke has Lex Luthor's life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth. Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him. After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #5</ref> Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate he is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower. The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed. Deathstroke witnesses the only \"hero\" from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities. Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor. He was also seen in the post-credit scenes of ''[[Justice League]]''.\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nIn ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Deathstroke, along with [[Lady Shiva]], is mentioned as one of the enemies that Batman thinks may be attacking him on [[Two-Face (comics)|Two-Face]]'s orders.<ref>''All-Star Batman'' #4</ref> He also stars in an ongoing series where he has a change of conscience and recruits a team of young superheroes to redeem his past misdeeds. In addition, he has come into contact with the African hero Red Lion/President Matthew Bland of Buredunia.<ref>''Deathstroke: Rebirth'' #1</ref> Bland offers him a high sum for making sure his competition was not bringing in US forces, in exchange for Slade's Ikon Suit made of [[Promethium]] for his own suit.<ref>''Deathstroke: Rebirth'' #4</ref> He attempts to save his son by using [[Speed Force]] energy off from [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]], but he was thwarted by both Titans and Teen Titans. He later builds the newest team called Defiance, with both his children, Wintergreen, Adeline Kane and Wallace as his teammates.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #18</ref>\nIt was later disbanded after [[Power Girl]] committed suicide, and Slade's attempts have grown worse to himself.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #20</ref>\n\nDeathstroke was later imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]], though he escapes and later defeated by the Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #28 (2019)</ref> In order for his death-wish to be confirmed, he releases all the inmates that [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] had put to attack the Titans, he came close of Damian to kill him, but instead, he was killed by [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]].<ref>\u201dDeathstroke\u201d #43</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSlade Wilson's physical and mental attributes have been enhanced as a result of the experimental serum he was given; he possesses heightened [[Superhuman strength|strength]], agility, durability, and reflexes, and has the ability to utilize up to [[Ten percent of the brain myth|90 percent of his brain capacity]]. Deathstroke also possesses a regenerative healing factor that enables him to recover from physical injury much more rapidly than a normal human; it does, however, have its limits, as it could not heal his missing eye nor can it regenerate entire limbs. This enhanced endurance enables him to survive otherwise fatal injuries, though recovering from such injuries renders him temporarily insane and ferociously animalistic. In addition to being a military tactical genius with years of military experience, Deathstroke is an expert in many forms of unarmed combat and martial arts as well, serving as a master of [[Krav Maga]], [[Kung Fu]], [[B\u014djutsu]], [[Boxing]], [[Jojutsu]], [[Judo]], [[Jujitsu]], [[Karate]], and [[Ninjutsu]].\n\nDeathstroke is highly proficient in the use of various firearms and melee weapons. He typically wields a wide variety of swords, including katanas, giant broadswords, and volatile Promethium-forged swords that can redistribute copious amounts of energy from any source directed against them.<ref>''Batman: Arkham City Lockdown''</ref><ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 4 #8\">''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #8</ref> Deathstroke also utilizes a ballistic staff that fires energy blasts from both ends, though in more realism-focused versions, it fires bullets and miniature cannonball-like pellets instead. His staff can bend and stretch to adhere to his different martial art forms. Deathstroke's Promethium body armor is composed of a mesh-woven [[Kevlar]] chainlink [[Mail (armor)|mail]] capable of deflecting small arms fire. In ''The New 52'', this armor is meshed with Nth metal as well, allowing it to absorb blows from [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] and [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]], although it could not withstand the power of [[Mazahs]].<ref>''Forever Evil'' #7</ref>\n\nDeathstroke would eventually don the \"Ikon Suit\" (named after Slade's old friend, David Isherwood a.k.a. \"Dr. Ikon\", a war and spec-ops engineer <ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #2''</ref>), a prototype point defense gravity sheathe controlled by bodily gestures alongside EEG (Electroencephalography) leads in his mask.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #2</ref> When a source of kinetic energy comes up against its protective shielding, a gravitational tidal effect occurs; a greater surface area causes a weaker defense shield, but a smaller surface area results in the sheathe being virtually indestructible.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 4 #7</ref> However, the suit's programming can be manipulated by any other Ikon suit with the master programming, allowing one who wears a perfected Ikon Suit to activate or deactivate other Ikon suits at their discretion.<ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 4 #8\"/>\n\nDeathstroke has also briefly wielded a divinely forged sword, crafted by [[Hephaestus]], called \"The God Killer\".<ref>''DC Sneak Peek: Deathstroke (Digital)'' #1</ref> This sword can discharge vorpal shock-waves and redirect whatever force it is met with, and the primordial energy crackling within it enables it to shape-shift into a Bo Staff, Twin Swords, Cat-o-Nine tails, etc.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #8\u20139</ref><ref>''Deathstroke Annual'' Vol. 3 #1</ref><ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 3 #9\">''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> The sword is known to be semi-sentient and can be summoned to its owner via a mental link.<ref>''Deathstroke'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> This powerful weapon enabled Deathstroke to take on supernatural deities, a Kryptonian and a half-Amazon demigoddess.<ref name=\"Deathstroke Vol. 3 #9\"/> If broken, The God Killer sword can recreate itself from its scattered remains at will.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Earth One===\nIn ''[[Teen Titans: Earth One]]'' continuity, an unscarred Slade is a member of S.T.A.R. Labs, which in this version are the main antagonistic force behind the creation of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]. <ref>''Teen Titans: Earth One'' Vol 1 #1</ref> His son Joseph and him as lead enforcers who engage the Titans.\n\n===Deathstroke: Journey's End===\nThe ''Deathstroke Annual'' for 1994 was an ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story featuring Deathstroke in a post-apocalyptic world. Deathstroke fights a legion of mutants and desperately tries to help humanity rise from the ashes of its ruined civilization.<ref>''Deathstroke Annual'' #3 (1994)</ref>\n\n===Uncanny X-Men/New Teen Titans===\nIn the [[intercompany crossover]] ''The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans'', Deathstroke meets his [[Deadpool|equal]] in the form of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]; the two fight to a near standstill. At the same time, however, he proved skilled enough to defeat [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] in a one-on-one fight despite the latter's superior physical strength.\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn [[Amalgam Comics]], Deathstroke is combined with Marvel's [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to become \"Dare the Terminator\", alias Slade Murdock. Unlike Wilson and Murdock, Dare is a woman. Though Dare is legally blind, she wears an eyepatch because of her mangled right eye. She also has horns surgically attached to her forehead. She uses a sword in combat.<ref>''Assassins'' #1 (April 1996)</ref>\n\nIn another comic, there is a Deathstroke amalgam called X-Stroke the Eliminator, who is a merging of Deathstroke and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: X#X-Cutioner|X-Cutioner]]. It is mentioned he is responsible for convincing Terra-X (amalgam of [[Terra (comics)|Tara Markov]] and [[Terrax]] and Dare's daughter) to betray the X-Patrol (an amalgam of [[X-Force]] and [[Doom Patrol]]).<ref>''The Exciting X-Patrol'' #1 (June 1997)</ref>\n\n===Tangent Comics===\nIn [[Tangent Comics]], Deathstroke is an armored supervillain and a member of the [[Fatal Five]]. This version exists on Earth-97 of the [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Original Multiverse|Old Multiverse]] and Earth-9 of the [[The 52|New Multiverse]].\n\n===Mash-Up===\nIn the [[Superman/Batman]] storyline \"Mash-Up\", elements of Slade are combined with parts of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], creating the villain \"Doomstroke\".<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #60</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' reality, Deathstroke is a pirate, searching with his crew formed by [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]], whom he broke out of a floating prison, [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]], [[Fisherman (comics)|Fisherman]], [[Clayface]], [[Machiste]] and [[List of Flashpoint (comics) characters#Villains|The Eel]] for any sunken loot to steal in the flooded remains of Paris, and also for his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]], who has been kidnapped by persons unknown.<ref name=\"fdcr\">''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Deathstroke and his crew were however soon attacked by [[Aquaman]] and his brother the [[Ocean Master]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)</ref> Aquaman stabs Deathstroke in the chest with his trident telling Ocean Master \"no survivors\".<ref name=\"fdcr\"/> After the attack, Deathstroke was saved from death by [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]], who demanded to be made second-in-command in return. While continuing their journey, the pirates were ambushed by the fleet of [[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]] and forced to surrender, but are then saved by Jenny Blitz who destroyed one of Warlord's ships.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Afterwards, Blitz agrees to join Deathstroke in searching for his daughter and developed a relationship in-between. Soon Deathstroke and Blitz were alerted that his crew were planning a mutiny. Deathstroke and Blitz fought and killed the treacherous crew, but Sonar manage to contact another pirate fleet under the leadership of the Caretaker before Deathstroke shot him. Later, Deathstroke and Jenny approaches the Caretaker's fleet and discovers Rose is being held captive. Deathstroke formulates a plan by offering to exchange Caretaker with a stasis-like Jenny for Rose's freedom. However, the Caretaker double-crosses on their deal and have his crew to attack him. But Deathstroke unleashes Jenny from her stasis upon Caretaker's fleet. During the battle, Deathstroke ignited a grenade at a weapon stockpile which destroyed Caretaker's ship and its crew with it. Deathstroke and Blitz were rescued by Rose. Reunited with his daughter, Deathstroke sails towards an unknown destination.<ref>''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Superman: American Alien''===\nDeathstroke appears in ''Superman: American Alien'', where he was sent by [[Carmine Falcone]] to assassinate a young Bruce Wayne who is supposedly on a yacht party. However, like everyone else on the boat, he mistakes a young Clark Kent for Bruce and is surprised when the neurotoxin he put in Clark's drink just makes him dizzy instead of killing him. He tries cutting him up with his sword, but is further befuddled when the sword breaks over Clark's durable skin, and Clark simply flicks him off of the yacht to defeat him.<ref>''Superman: American Alien'' #3</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nDeathstroke appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'''s chapter 35 of Year Five, the last series before the game. The actions of the Regime has forced Deathstroke into early retirement, causing him to develop a grudge. Batman and [[Lex Luthor]] need a [[Mother Box]] located in S.T.A.R. Labs that will allow them to pull over doppelgangers from another universe to combat the Regime. Since Batman is the most wanted man on the planet, Deathstroke is the next best person to retrieve it, which he agrees to. He breaks into the facility and is easily able to fend off any soldiers standing guard. When he obtains the Mother Box, he is greeted by [[Metamorpho]] before he can leave. He is able to kill him after a tense fight and, realizing he will not get out with the Mother Box, uploads a blueprint of the device and sends it to Batman and Luthor so they can build it themselves.

This incarnation simply goes by \"Slade\" as \"Deathstroke\" was not considered suitable for a show aimed at children. He is depicted as an enigmatic criminal mastermind rather than a mercenary/assassin, dispatching slews of supervillains and robot henchmen to eliminate the [[Teen Titans]]. After being killed by his apprentice, [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], Slade is resurrected as an undead powerful skeletal being by the demon [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], the father of Titans member [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], to aid in his conquest of Earth. Slade later betrays Trigon and temporarily aids the Titans in defeating him, reclaiming his life in the process before disappearing. An illusion of Slade torments Beast Boy about his failure to save Terra but is revealed to be a robot in the series finale.\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', initially voiced by [[Wentworth Miller]] in \"The Fix\" and by [[Fred Tatasciore]] onwards after.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/16/sdcc-2012-kevin-smith-beware-the-batman-teen-titans-go-reveals-dc-nation-panel/ |title=MTV Geek \u2013 SDCC 2012: Kevin Smith Presents \u2018Beware the Batman\u2019 and \u2018Teen Titans Go!\u2019 Reveals at the DC Nation Panel |publisher=Geek-news.mtv.com |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115055/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/07/16/sdcc-2012-kevin-smith-beware-the-batman-teen-titans-go-reveals-dc-nation-panel/ |archivedate=February 17, 2013 }}</ref> He first appears in the season two episode \"True Colors\", during which he officially replaces [[Sportsmaster]] as [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]'s enforcer. He serves as [[Black Manta]]'s personal assassin for the remainder of the season. Deathstroke returns in season three having replaced [[Ra's al Ghul]] as a member of The Light and leader of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]]. Deathstroke and [[Lady Shiva]] forge an alliance with [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] to form a [[metahuman]] trafficking ring on the island of [[Santa Prisca]]. After Nightwing's Outsiders team seemingly frees the metahuman [[Terra (comics)|Princess Terra Markov]] from The Light's captivity, Terra is revealed to be a spy working for Deathstroke.\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version of Slade Wilson was originally a [[CIA]] agent who was terminated by his mentor [[Alfred Pennyworth]] for his ruthless methods. Slade then became the international assassin \"Deathstroke\", and is eventually hired by [[Anarky]] and [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] to kill Batman. Deathstroke accepts the contract in order to exact revenge on Pennyworth, who has since \"replaced\" him with Bruce Wayne as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Slade poses as \"Dane Lisslow\" for most of the program's run to get close to Bruce and Alfred, and ends up losing his right eye during a fight with Batman in the series finale.\n*Deathstroke (referred to as \"Slade\", similar to the original 2000s ''Teen Titans'' series) is alluded several times in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. His face can be seen on Robin's punching bag in several episodes, and he is indirectly mentioned by his daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose Wilson / Ravager]] in the episode \"Cool School\", when she tells [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] that they both have father issues. Also, in the episode \"Terra-ized\", [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] is shown to have infiltrated the Titans Tower to steal the team's secrets for a greater villain, who is implied to be Slade. At the beginning of the episode \"The Return of Slade\", the Titans build up the hype for their upcoming battle with Slade, but the entire event ultimately takes place off-screen. Slade's only physical appearance in the series is briefly at the end of the episode \"The Titans Show\", where he is seen among the other major villains from the DC Universe summoned by Control Freak to fight the Titans (with the episode ending before the actual battle).\n* In May 2019, [[The CW]] announced the animated series ''[[Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons]]'' for their CW Seed platform.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title='Deathstroke' Animated Series, 'The Pledge' Horror Series In Works At CW Seed |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/deathstroke-animated-series-the-pledge-series-cw-seed-1202616395/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=May 16, 2019 |language=en |date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> The series premiered in the first quarter of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/deathstroke-cw-seed-animated-series-voice-cast-teaser-trailer/|title=Deathstroke Animated Series Announces Voice Cast with Bloody Teaser Trailer|author=Tim Adams|website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|date=October 4, 2019|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> [[Michael Chiklis]] provided the voice for the character.<ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/47269-michael-chiklis-to-voice-deathstroke-in-cw-seed-series.html]</ref>\n*Deathstroke appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[D.

Former scientist, '''Earl Gregg''' is involved in an accident in the lab exposed him to magnetic particles, permanently altering his body and granting him magnetic powers. His assistant, who afterwards becomes his wife, helps by creating a special suit to contain his powers and keep metal from being drawn to him while out in public. The suit even has a symbol of its own: resembling the force lines of a magnetic field, forming a stylized figure eight. After this, he becomes an assassin, murdering his targets with his powers, first by drawing the target to him, then by magnetizing the iron in their blood cells, causing a figure-eight mark on the chest as the person dies of a heart attack. The couple take the name Bob and Carol Stanford when they arrive in Metropolis; they become friends with Clark Kent and Lois Lane as they discover that Lois is going to be interviewing Grant Gendell, an eccentric reclusive billionaire. The couple plan to assassinate Gendell before he goes public, taking his identity and thus his fortune. The plan is foiled when Superman interferes, destroying Deathstroke's containment suit, which causes him to be magnetically drawn to a steel pillar until the police arrive. Very much like Superman, Deathstroke kept a secret identity by wearing a pair of glasses.\n* Slade Wilson appears in the tenth season of ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by [[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]] in the episode \"Patriot\". This version is a [[United States Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] and a suspected war criminal behind the anti-superhero Vigilante Registration Act legislation. After his capture of [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Green Arrow/Oliver Queen]], [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] failed, he is cornered by Clark Kent, who destroys the facility. Slade (who is revealed to be branded with the Omega-Symbol via X-Ray vision) is later saved from death by [[Darkseid]] and advanced military technology, losing his right eye but gaining healing abilities in the process (rendering him \"beyond Death's stroke\"). In the episode \"Icarus\", he arranges for the [[Justice League (Smallville)|League]]'s allies [[Emil Hamilton]], [[Tess Mercer]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] to be arrested and taken into VRA headquarters, and attempts to murder Lois in [[LuthorCorp]] Tower. He later impales [[Hawkman]] fatally who falls to his death saving Lois from an explosion and is sent to the [[Phantom Zone]] by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] soon after. In the episode \"Dominion\", he is later released from the Zone and placed in a coma by a merged [[General Zod|Zod]] using him as bait to lure Clark.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | width1    = 167\n | width2    = 181\n | image1    = Arrow Billy Wintergreen.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Jeffery C.

His Deathstroke outfit is the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service|ASIS]] wear, as members of the unit [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]] wear dark grey uniforms with black and orange bi-colored balaclavas.\n** [[Manu Bennett]] portrays [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]] himself on ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' initially to search to extract ex-Chinese military [[Yao Fei (Arrowverse)|Yao Fei]]. Throughout the [[Arrow (season 1)|first]] and [[Arrow (season 2)|second]] seasons' flashbacks, Slade trains marooned playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Oliver Queen]] in combat while they are on the island of [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], beginning Queen's path in becoming a vigilante, even stopping Fyers and former friend Billy Wintergreen in the season one finale. In season two, a mortally wounded Slade later gains superhuman strength and reflexes when he takes the \"mirakuru\" supersoldier formula. The serum drives Slade insane and eventually causes him to despise Oliver when [[Anthony Ivo (Arrowverse)|Dr. Anthony Ivo]] kills [[Shado (Arrowverse)|Shado]], Oliver's girlfriend, whom Slade was in love with. Upon taking the [[Amazo|ship]] and killing Ivo, Oliver and [[Sara Lance]] decide to kill Slade with Oliver forced to drive an arrow through Slade's right eye in an attempt to kill him. In season two's present day narrative, Slade returns as the terrorist mercenary known as \"Deathstroke\" and wreaks havoc on Oliver's life, killing his mother [[Moira Queen (Arrowverse)|Moira]] and overwhelming Starling City with mirakuru-enhanced soldiers sporting gray ASIS unit masks. In addition, he hires [[Isabel Rochev]] to act as his [[Ravager (comics)|prodigy]] and positioned [[Sebastian Blood (Arrowverse)|Sebastian Blood]] as the mayor up to his betrayal and her death. In the season finale, Oliver defeats Slade and cures him of his powers before imprisoning him in an [[A.R.G.U.S. (Arrowverse)|A.R.G.U.S.]] prison on Lian Yu. In the [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]] episode \"The Return\", Slade escapes his underground confinement and torments Oliver and his sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] during their training session on Lian Yu, though he is ultimately recaptured. Deathstroke is briefly seen in the [[Arrow (season 4)|season four]] episode \"Genesis\" as a vision in Oliver's mind, and reappears in the show's [[Invasion! (Arrow)|100th episode]] as a [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominator]]-induced hallucination. Slade returns in the final two episodes of the [[Arrow (season 5)|fifth season]], helping Oliver and his army of former enemies to release his allies and fight against [[Prometheus (Arrowverse)|Prometheus]]'s forces. In the [[Arrow (season 6)|sixth season]], Slade appears in \"Fallout\", \"Deathstroke Returns\" and \"Promises Kept\", during which Slade attempts to track down his son [[Joe Wilson (Arrowverse)|Joe]].\n** '''[[Grant Wilson (Arrowverse)|Grant Wilson]]''' (portrayed by Jamie Andrew Cutler) appears in the episode \"Star City 2046\" of the ''Arrow'' spin-off show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. As Slade's son, he takes up the Deathstroke mantle and continues his father's legacy in the year 2046. He is eventually defeated by [[Legends of Tomorrow (team)|Legends]], [[Connor Hawke (Arrowverse Earth-16)|Connor Hawke]] and an older Oliver Queen. His name is mentioned in ''Arrow'' episode \"Promises Kept\", where his brother Joe reveals his existence to his father Slade. Grant's suit has a black-and-gray helmet as opposed to black-and-orange. Grant Wilson appears in the episode \"Present Tense\" portrayed again by Jamie Andrew Cutler. He becomes the latest Deathstroke and leads an earlier version of the Deathstroke Gang in order to follow in his father's footsteps. At the time when they were brought to the present, [[Mia Smoak]], [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], and William Clayton at first mistook him for a time-displaced John Diggle Jr. when they arrive at where the Deathstroke Gang had their hideout in 2040. After Green Arrow rescues them from a motion-activated bomb trap, William and Connor came clean about the bad parts of 2040 which included Grant Wilson training John Diggle Jr. to be his apprentice as well as Zoe Ramirez's death which left John Diggle and Rene Ramirez devastated. When it came to the Deathstroke Gang's planned attack, Team Arrow and Future Team Arrow took the battle to three different fronts. When Grant is defeated, Mia is talked out of killing him by Green Arrow. It was mentioned by Dinah Drake that Grant was arrested and remanded to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]].\n** '''Joe Wilson''' (portrayed by Liam Hall) first appears as Slade's son in the ''Arrow'' episodes \"Deathstroke Returns\" and \"Promises Kept\" under the name '''Kane Wolfman'''.

His wife Adeline discovered his alter ego when their son Jericho was kidnapped and rendered mute by enemies of one of Slade's employers. Upon separating from his wife, Slade had a one-night stand with a local prostitute and unintentionally impregnated her with a daughter named Rose. In 2014, Deathstroke killed [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]], a member of the original Titans, whilst attempting to fulfill a contract. Dick Grayson then revealed Slade's true nature to Jericho and recruited him to join the Titans. As Deathstroke prepares to kill Dick for fracturing his relationship with his son, Jericho sacrifices himself to save Grayson before transferring his consciousness into Slade's body and inadvertently trapping himself within his father's mind.

A recurring joke in the film is the Titans mistaking Slade for [[Deadpool]], which annoys him, as Deathstroke was introduced in comics first.\n\n=====DC Animated Movie Universe=====\n[[File:AnimatedMovieDeathstroke.jpg|thumb|right|Deathstroke's character design in the [[DC Animated Movie Universe]].]]\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' (2013), voiced again by [[Ron Perlman]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|title=UPDATE: FLASHPOINT PARADOX Reveals Reverse Flash, Director|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/dc-animated-flashpoint-paradox-news.html|publisher=Newsarama}}</ref> In the [[Flashpoint (comics)|altered reality]] inadvertently created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], Deathstroke is the captain of a ship called ''The Ravager''. He and [[Lex Luthor]] attempt to locate [[Aquaman]]'s [[Captain Atom|doomsday device]], but are ambushed by [[Ocean Master]] and the Atlantean army. Deathstroke manages to cut through hoards of Atlanteans, overpowering both [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Kaldur'ahm]], before being presumably killed by [[Black Manta]]'s optic blasts. The Flash later alters the timeline once more and creates a [[The New 52|new reality]] similar to the original.\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Son of Batman]]'' (2014), voiced by [[Thomas Gibson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Son-of-Batman-First-Look-1076369.aspx|title=First Look: It's Father's Day for the Dark Knight in Son of Batman|work=TV Guide}}</ref> In the new reality created at the end of ''The Flashpoint Paradox'', Slade Wilson is a former member of the [[League of Assassins]] who served as [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s right-hand and future heir until his dishonorable actions deemed him unworthy. Feeling denied his right, Slade stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and kills his mentor though [[Damian Wayne]] manages to stab Slade's right eye. Now calling himself \"Deathstroke\", Slade forces [[Man-Bat|Dr. Kirk Langstrom]] to genetically transform members of the League into [[Man-Bat#Man-Bat Commandos|Man-Bat]] ninja warriors. After capturing and severely wounding [[Talia al Ghul]], Deathstroke is defeated by [[Batman]] and Damian/Robin while his underwater base is destroyed.\n* Deathstroke returns in ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'' (2017), voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]] in his final role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/teen-titans-judas-contract-movie-sets-voice-cast-965621|title=Christina Ricci, Miguel Ferrer Join Voice Cast of 'Teen Titans' Animated Movie (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 19, 2017}}</ref> It is revealed that he survived the events of ''Son of Batman'' by rejuvenating himself in a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Deathstroke is contracted by [[Brother Blood]] to capture the [[Teen Titans]], and plants his juvenile lover [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] as a double-agent within their ranks to do so. After failing to capture Titans member [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Deathstroke betrays Terra and offers her to Brother Blood instead. When the Titans manage to free themselves, Deathstroke engages Nightwing and Robin until an enraged Terra uses her powers to bring down Blood's underground lair, leaving Deathstroke's fate uncertain.\n* Deathstroke makes a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'' (2018). He is seen during a flashback where [[Bronze Tiger]] recalls his fianc\u00e9e's murder, which Deathstroke carried out whilst still a member of the League of Assassins.\n\n===Video games===\n* On August 20, 2008, [[Ed Boon]] announced Deathstroke as one of the DC villains who would appear in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5039348/wonder-woman-raiden-two-of-four-new-kombatants | title=Wonder Woman, Raiden Two of Four New Kombatants | last=McWhertor | first=Michael | work=[[Kotaku]] | date=August 20, 2008}}</ref> played by Chris Matthews and voiced by [[Patrick Seitz]]. He is a counterpart of [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]. In the story, Deathstroke appears in Metropolis where he beheads a thug who paid him the money he owed Deathstroke late. Then Deathstroke is attacked and defeated by Flash. When in Gotham City, he attacks [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] (who is trying to hunt down Scorpion) seeing this new assassin as an enemy. Sub-Zero wins the battle, but does not bother finishing off Deathstroke fearing the essence of the Netherrealm that leads to Scorpion would become too weak to follow if he wasted any more time. Later, Deathstroke teams up with [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. He helps Joker try to take on [[Sonya Blade]] and [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]. Joker fights Sonya while Deathstroke battles Kano. In the middle of his fight, Deathstroke is pushed aside by Joker who defeats Kano and turns on Deathstroke when the Combat Rage takes over Joker. Deathstroke's game ending has him realizing that other-worldly assassins are seen as unwelcome competition. As a caution, he creates an army of assassins in his image, becoming the leader of the \"Deathstrike Clan\" (the DC Universe's version of the [[Lin Kuei]]).\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Tracy W. Bush. He is a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]], and appears in multiple Instances and Alerts. During the Batman story quest line, he is sent by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to assassinate the [[Riddler]] for informing the heroes of the source of Joker's new venom. In the Villain's campaign, he will join the player in a fight against [[Bruno Mannheim]] to steal the Bible of Crime.

The alternate incarnation is seen in [[Carol Ferris|Ferris Aircraft]] being tortured by the Regime's [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] until [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] appears and escapes during the fight. Later on, he joins up with the Insurgency and helps the mainstream version of Cyborg into taking control of the Watchtower's teleportation system. In Deathstroke's ending, new governments start to form to replace Superman's. With new governments comes new orders for assassinations, insurrections to cause and revolutions to support, too much for even Deathstroke to handle. Using his skills to hunt down hidden Regime soldiers, Deathstroke forms a clan of the world's most successful political assassins called the New Titans. A [[Red Son]]-in game exclusive skin was released as part of [[Downloadable content|DLC]].\n* Deathstroke appears in ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''. He appears as one of the villains summoned by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] to collect starites. This version appears to have taken aspects from the ''Teen Titans'' animated series (battling Cyborg and being referred to as \"Slade\") He and Doppelganger arrive on the Watchtower to find a starite but are defeated by Maxwell and Cyborg. They are teleported away by Brainiac but not before they free [[Amazo]]. Deathstroke can then be spawned by the player and is playable in the Wii U version.

{"title_page": "Jury", "text_new": "skory Bryant Gutierrez es el presidente de los estados unidos & tambi\u00e9n es mi esposo\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''jury'' derives from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''jur\u00e9'' (\"sworn\"). Juries are most common in [[common law]] [[Adversarial system|adversarial-system]] [[jurisdiction]]s. In the modern system, juries act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]], while judges act as triers of law (but see [[Jury#Jury nullification|nullification]]). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and [[Question of law|questions of law]] are decided by a judge) is known as a [[bench trial]].\n\n==Types of jury==\n\n===Petit jury===\n{{main|Petit jury}}\nThe \"petit jury\" (or \"trial jury\", sometimes \"petty jury\") hears the [[evidence]] in a [[trial]] as presented by both the [[plaintiff]] (petitioner) and the [[defendant]] (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often [[jury instructions]] from the [[judge]], the group retires for [[deliberation]], to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or [[supermajority]]. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a [[hung jury]]. The size of the jury varies; in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors.\n\nIn [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] many trials require fewer than twelve jurors.\n\n===Grand jury===\n{{main|Grand jury}}\nA grand jury, a type of jury now confined almost exclusively to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a [[prosecutor]] and issuing [[indictment]]s, or by investigating alleged [[crime]]s and issuing [[Wiktionary:presentment|presentments]]. A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings.  Grand juries can also be used for filing charges in the form of a [[sealed indictment]] against unaware suspects who are arrested later by a surprise police visit.\n\nIn addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamisao.com/publications/grandjuryreports.htm |title=CURRENT GRAND JURY REPORTS \u2013 Miami Dade Office of the State Attorney |publisher=Miamisao.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the [[Government Accountability Office]] in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.\n\n===Coroner's jury===\n{{main|Coroner's jury}}\nA third kind of jury, known as a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an [[inquest]] by a [[coroner]].  A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases.  A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy.<ref>See, e.g., Section 1245.1 of Pennsylvania's codified laws regarding coroners. http://www.pacoroners.org/Laws.php</ref>  In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.<ref>See, e.g., Inquest Schedule, Jury Findings and Vedicts (2013) of British Columbia. http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/schedule/index.htm (retrieved March 8, 2013)</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nServing on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. A jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. Procedures and requirements may include a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Juries are initially chosen randomly, usually from the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court's jurisdictional area. [[Jury selection]] in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge\u2014[[voir dire]]\u2014as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve (\"challenge for cause\"), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection (\"peremptory challenge\"), before the jury is [[wikt:impanel|impaneled]].\n\nA head juror is called the \"foreperson\", \"foreman\" or \"presiding juror\". The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury's deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson's role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, [[Facilitator|facilitating]] jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.\n\nSince there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors are selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury.  In Connecticut, alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation.  Connecticut General Statutes 51\u2013243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51\u2013243(e) provides that alternate jurors \"shall be dismissed.\" This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate jurors, and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.\n\nWhen an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.<ref>See, e.g., Sections 13-71-112 and 30-10-607, Colorado Revised Statutes</ref>\n\n==Historical roots==\n[[File:The Jury by John Morgan.jpg|thumb|''The Jury'', an 1861 painting of a British jury]]\n\nThe modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the [[vehmic court]] system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the [[Norman Conquest]], some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.\n\nThe modern [[jury trial]] evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].<ref>W.L. Warren, \"Henry II\" University of California Press,(1973)</ref>  Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an \"ancient institution\" even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government\u2014[[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]]s (an administrative sub-division of the [[shire]], embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood.  The [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country.  The jury in this period was \"self-informing,\" meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court.  The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.<ref>Daniel Klerman, [http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf \"Was the Jury Every Self-Informing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013900/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} Southern California Law Review 77: (2003), 123.</ref> \n\nBetween 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the [[English Common Law]].  Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony.  Jurors 'found' a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory\u2014little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud.  Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court's decision which was then subject to appeal.  Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power. (\"Henry II\" 293)\n\nIn 1215 the [[Catholic Church]] removed its sanction from all forms of the ordeal\u2014procedures by which suspects up to that time were 'tested' as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief's hand.  If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty).  With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience.  Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged. (\"Henry II\" 358)\n\nAn early reference to a jury type group in England is in a decree issued by Aethelred at Wantage (997), which provided that in every Hundred \"the twelve leading [[thegn]]s together with the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] shall go out and swear on the [[relic]]s which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one.\"<ref>Oxford History of England, 2nd ed 1955, vol III Domesday Book to Magna Carta, A l Poole, pp.397\u2013398.</ref> The resulting [[\u00c6thelred the Unready#Origin of the jury|Wantage Code]] formally recognized legal customs that were part of the [[Danelaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|title=Wantage Church History|last=Garnish|first=Lis|year=1995|work=Local History Series|publisher=[[Vale and Downland Museum]]|accessdate=2009-09-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925045004/http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe testimonial concept can also be traced to [[Normandy]] before 1066 when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.<ref>See, for example, discussions of the Brunner theory of testimonial, rather than judicial participation as jury origin, explored in MacNair, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.3/macnair.html ''Vicinage and the Antecedents of the Jury \u2013 I.

These juries voted by [[secret ballot]] and were eventually granted the power to annul [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] laws, thus introducing the practice of [[judicial review]]. In modern justice systems, the law is considered \"self-contained\" and \"distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community,\" but \"all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general.\"<ref>Carey, Christopher. \"Legal Space in Classical Athens.\" ''Greece & Rome'' 41(2): October  1994, pp. 172\u2013186.</ref>\n\nIn juries of the [[Justice in Eyre|Justices in Eyre]], the [[bailiff]] of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.<ref>{{cite book | title= A History of English Law | volume= 1 | first= William Searle | last= Holdsworth | authorlink= William Searle Holdsworth | pages= 268\u2013269 | year= 1922 | publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] | edition= 3 | oclc= 48555551 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DQF-ASQE7xAC&pg=PA268 | ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n===18th century England===\nIn 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries.<ref>Dowlen, Oliver. Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation. (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 38</ref> The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as [[sortition]], from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impaneling juries.\n\nPrior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.\n\nThe example of early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries can be used to organize the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state. It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen-state relationship. The need for a leader/organizer in a jury is very important, in order to get a proper and agreed verdict.\n\n===19th century England===\nIn 1825, the rules concerning juror selection were consolidated. Property qualifications and various other rules were standardised, although an exemption was left open for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts.<ref name=\"Juries Act 1825, s50\">{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1825/50/pdfs/ukpga_18250050_en.pdf}}</ref> This reflected a more general understanding that local officials retained a large amount of discretion regarding which people they actually summoned.

The exemption which had been created by the 1825 Act for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts meant ten towns were free to ignore the property qualifications. This amplified in these towns the general understanding that local officials had a free hand in summoning freely from among those people who were qualified to be jurors. In 1920, three of these ten towns - Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottingham - consistently empanelled assize juries of six men and six women; while at the Bristol, Exeter, and Norwich assizes no women were empanelled at all.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crosby |first1=Kevin |title=Restricting the Juror Franchise in 1920s England and Wales |journal=Law and History Review |date=2019 |volume=37 |issue=1 |page=195 |doi=10.1017/S0738248018000639|url=https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=247766/84A91BAF-7996-4285-921C-85219429B434.pdf&pub_id=247766 }}</ref> This quickly led to a tightening up of the rules, and an abolition of these ten towns' discretion.

In 2009 a review by the [[Scottish Government]] regarding the possibility of reduction<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7368294.stm Review could reduce jury numbers] BBC News, 26 April 2008</ref> led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it \"uniquely right\".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Scotland39s-unique-15strong--juries.5252536.jp Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished] The Scotsman, 11 May 2009</ref> Trials in the [[Republic of Ireland]] which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.\n\nA study by the [[University of Glasgow]] suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.<ref>''Is \"The More the Merrier?\"'', [[Mental Floss]], November\u2013December 2011, p. 74</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Verkaik|first1=Robert|title=Juries 'swayed by dominant speakers'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/juries-swayed-by-dominant-speakers-9167289.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=Independent|date=September 3, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Uhlig|first1=Robert|title=Juries are 'too large for correct verdicts'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339399/Juries-are-too-large-for-correct-verdicts.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Integrity==\nFor juries to fulfill their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from [[Mass media|media]] or the Internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a [[crime scene]]). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute [[reversible error]]. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.\n\nJurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in [[Confidentiality|strict confidence]] during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In Canadian and [[English law]], the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be [[contempt of court]], a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.\n\nBecause of the importance of preventing [[undue influence]] on a jury, [[jury tampering]] (like [[witness tampering]]) is a serious crime, whether attempted through [[bribery]], [[Assault (tort)|threat of violence]], or other means. Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality.\n\n==Role==\nThe role of the jury is described as that of a [[finder of fact]], while the judge is seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable.  Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a \"special verdict.\"  A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a \"general verdict.\"\n\nJuries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Norms Approach to Jury \"Nullification:\" Interests, Values, and Scripts|author=Sanders, Joseph|volume=30|issue=1|pages=12\u201345|date=16 January 2008|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105085320/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9930.2008.00268.x|journal=Law & Policy}}</ref> A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases.  For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence.  Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove.  It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts.  However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as \"jury nullification of law\" or simply [[jury nullification]]. When there is no jury (\"bench trial\"), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.\n\nThe collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:\n<blockquote>\nDetailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts\u2019 testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html Jury Trials: In Favor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128052243/http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html |date=2010-11-28 }} eJournal USA, Anatomy of a Jury Trial, 1 July 2009</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues.  This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant's sentence if the defendant is convicted.  This practice was required in all [[death penalty]] cases in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, where the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}} resulted in the Supreme Court's expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\".<ref>''Apprendi'', at 490</ref>\n\nMany U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an [[advisory jury]] in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge,<ref>See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011); Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011).</ref> although this procedural tool is rarely used.  For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as \"pain and suffering\" damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving \"equitable\" rather than \"legal\" claims.\n\nIn Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing.  The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down.  In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee<ref>Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-20-104, 40-20-107</ref> and Texas,<ref>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.07 Sec. 1(b)</ref> juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.\n\nHowever, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law.  The exception is the award of [[damages]] in English law [[Slander and libel|libel]] cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.\n\nIn legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known are entitled to great deference on appeal.  In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems, evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact.  The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has a major impact on court procedure in these systems.  This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition.  The higher the stakes, the more this is true.  Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.\n\n==Jury nullification==\n{{Main|Jury nullification}}\n\n''Jury nullification'' means deciding not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case by jury decision.  In other words, it is \"the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=jury nullification definition \u2013 Dictionary \u2013 MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207015043/http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archivedate=2010-12-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker [[William Penn]] which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one [[Carnegie of Finhaven]] who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish [[Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]].  As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been \"proven\" and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing.  Instead, the jury asserted what is believed to be their \"ancient right\" to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of \"not guilty\". This led to the development of the not proven verdict in ''[[Scots law]].''\n\nToday in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge's instructions concerning what is the law and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court.  Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving [[slavery]] (see [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]), [[freedom of the press]] (see [[John Peter Zenger]]), and [[freedom of religion]] (see [[William Penn#Persecutions|William Penn]]).\n\nIn ''[[United States v. Moylan]]'', {{West|F|417|2|1002|4th. Cir.|1969|}}, [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal]] unanimously ruled: \"If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision.\"  The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]] is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law.  In ''[[Sparf v. the United States]]'', {{ussc|156|51|1895}}, the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.\n\nModern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.<ref>[http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/46-2/articles/parmenter-andrew.pdf Nullifying the Jury: \"The Judicial Oligarchy\" Declares War on Jury Nullification] [[Washburn Law Journal]] May 2, 2007, </ref>\n\n===Jury equity===\nIn the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called \"jury equity\". This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge \u2013 thus a jury has the power to influence the law.\n\nThe standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book \"Trial by Jury\". Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is \"the lamp that shows that freedom lives\" and that it is a \"little parliament\".<ref>[https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf Patrick Devlin, 'Trial by Jury'] (Stevens & Sons 1956)</ref> The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/13538022/Controlling_Devlins_Jury_what_the_jury_thinks_and_what_the_jury_sees_online_published_2012_ Kevin Crosby, 'Controlling Devlin's Jury: what the jury thinks, and what the jury sees online'] [2012] Criminal Law Review 15</ref> Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control is set in stone.\n\nPerhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in [[England and Wales]] was the acquittal of [[Clive Ponting]], on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] in 1985. Mr. Ponting's defense was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that \"the public interest is what the government of the day says it is\" \u2013 effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nAnother example is the acquittal in 1989 of [[Michael Randle]] and [[Pat Pottle]], who confessed in open court to charges of springing the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]] [[George Blake]] from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs Prison]] and smuggling him to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case, compounded by its cynical untimeliness.<ref name = \"New Statesman\">[http://www.newstatesman.com/200010090010  New Statesman], 2000-10-09.</ref>\n\nIn Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the \"not guilty\" verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the \"not guilty\" verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the \"not proven\" verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.<ref name=\"Luckhurst\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|last=Luckhurst|first=Tim|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=The Sunday Times, TimesOnline|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence.

A tied vote result in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty \u2013 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'.

During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure.

Criminal cases in the High Court and some civil cases are tried by a jury in [[Hong Kong]]. There is no jury in the District Court. In addition, from time to time, the Coroner's Court may summon a jury to decide the cause of death in an inquest.  Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.\n\nAlthough article 86 of the basic law states that \u2018the principle of trial by jury previously practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained\u2019, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by a jury.

Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the ''Corte d'Assise'', however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the ''Scuola Media'' (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the ''Corte d'Assise d'Appello'' (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the ''Scuola Superiore'' (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the [[stipend]]iary judges and \"Lay Judges\" together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named ''Camera di Consiglio'' (\"Counsel Chamber\"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact  lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them.  The ''Corte d'Assise'' has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include [[terrorism]], murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. [[assisted suicide]]), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the \"Lay Judges\" generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include [[life sentences]].\n\n===New Zealand===\nJuries are used in trials for all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11\u20131 or 10\u20131) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9\u20133 or 9\u20132) in civil cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=NZ's first majority guilty verdict|publisher=Stuff|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2563945/NZs-first-majority-guilty-verdict|accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref>\n\n===Norway===\nJuries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier.\nThey brought the jury system to [[England]] and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway's central government was in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].\nThough Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387\u20131536), and later under the governmental union (1536\u20131814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.\n\nThe jury was reintroduced in 1887, and was then solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system (\"[[Court of appeal (Norway)|Lagmannsretten]]\"). The jury consisted of 10 people, and had to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lov om rettergangsm\u00e5ten i straffesaker (Straffeprosessloven)|publisher=Lovdata|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-039.html|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> The jury never gave a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gave a \"guilty\" or \"non-guilty\" verdict.\n\nIn a sense, the concept of being judged by one's peers existed on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In [[Tingretten]], one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten two judges and five lay judges preside. The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], only [[Candidate of Law|trained lawyers]] are seated.\n\n===Spain===\n\nSpain has no strong tradition of using juries. However we can find mentions in the [[Bayonne Statute]]. Later, Article 307 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] allowed the ''Cortes'' to pass legislation if they felt that over the time it was needed to distinguish between \"judges of law\" and \"judges of facts\". Such legislation however was never enacted.\n\nArticle 2 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1837]] while proclamating the freedom of the people to publicate written contents without previous censorship according to the laws also provided that \"press crimes\" could only be tried by juries. This meant that a ''grand jury'' would need to indict, and a ''petit jury'' would need to convict.\n\nJuries were later abolished in 1845, but were later restored in 1869 for all \"political crimes\" and \"those common crimes the law may deem appropriate to be so tried by a jury\". A Law concerning the Jury entered into force on January 1, 1899 and lasted until 1936, where juries were again disbanded with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe actual [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution of 1978]] permits the ''Cortes Generales'' to pass legislation allowing juries in criminal trials. The provision is arguably somewhat vague: ''\"Article 125 \u2013 Citizens may engage in popular action and participate in the administration of justice through the institution of the Jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts.\"''\n\nJury trials can only happen in the criminal jurisdiction and it is not a choice of the defendant to be tried by jury, or by a single judge or a panel of judges. Organic Law 5/1995, of May 22<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-12095 |title=Ley Org\u00e1nica 5/1995, de 22 de mayo, del Tribunal del Jurado. |language=Spanish |year=1995 |access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> regulates the categories of crimes in which a trial by jury is mandatory. For all other crimes, a single judge or a panel of judges will decide both on facts and the law. Spanish juries are composed of 9 citizens and a professional Judge. Juries decide on facts and whether to convict or acquit the defendant. In case of conviction they can also make recommendations such as if the defendant should be pardoned if they asked to, or if they think the defendant could be released on parole, etc.\n\nOne of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/1997/03/07/espana/07N0018.html ESPA\u00d1A | Juicio a Mikel Otegi por asesinar a dos ertzainas.

In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.\n\nSweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution.<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222143058/http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx |date=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.\n\nThe jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury's guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6\u20133. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.\n\nJury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tryckfrihetsforordning-19491_sfs-1949-105/ Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordning (1949:105-SFS 2010:1409)] ''Riksdagen'' {{in lang|sv}}</ref><ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sw03000_.html The Freedom of the Press Act/Sweden] ''The International Constitutional Law Project''</ref>\n\nJuries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-penal-2001-1-page-355.htm |title=The advantages and disadvantages of lay judges from a Swedish perspective |publisher=Cairn.info |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blinamndeman.se/Bli-namndeman/Sa-blir-du-vald/ | title=S\u00e5 blir du vald - Bli n\u00e4mndeman}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\n{{main|Juries in England and Wales}}\nIn England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as expensive and time-consuming.<ref>Lloyd-Bostock S, Thomas C.

First the prosecution leads evidence from witnesses and after each witness the defence has an opportunity to cross examine.  Following the Prosecution case, the defence may move a motion of [[no case to answer]] if the worst the prosecution has been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime.  If there remains a case to answer, the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution, with cross examination being permitted after each witness. Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence, the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard.  The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict. Juries are composed of fifteen residents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Was I Picked For Jury Service? |publisher=Courtroom Advice|url=http://www.courtroomadvice.co.uk/why-was-I-picked-for-jury-service.html|accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Juries in the United States}}\nIn criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only [[testimony]] and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial.  In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16\u201323 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious.  If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a \"no bill.\"  If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a \"true bill.\"  Grand jury proceedings are ''ex parte'': only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted.  This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant.  It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial.  Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a \"no bill\" was returned by a previous grand jury.  A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes.  In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal.  Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.\n\nBoth [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III of the U.S. Constitution]] and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] require that criminal cases be tried by a jury.<ref name=\"King1999\">{{cite journal | author = King NJ | title = The American Criminal Jury |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&+Contemp.+Probs.+41+(Spring+1999) | year = 1999 | pages = 41\u201367 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192252 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192252}}</ref>  Originally this applied only to federal courts.  However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states.  Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars.<ref name=\"Landsman1999\">{{cite journal | author = Landsman S. | year = 1999 | title = The Civil Jury in America |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&+Contemp.+Probs.+285+(Spring+1999) | pages = 285\u2013304 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192260 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192260}}</ref> However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law.<ref>Amar, A.R. (1998). ''The Bill of Rights''. New Haven, CT: Yale University. pp. 81\u2013118.</ref>  However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment.  Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases.  The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.\n\nIn practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by [[plea bargain]].<ref name=\"plea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |title=Plea Bargains and the Role of Judges |work=2008 National Convention Breakout Session |publisher=The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007220413/http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |archivedate=2009-10-07 }}</ref>  Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.\n\nIn 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials.<ref name=Landsman1999/> In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a \"historical accident\", and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts.<ref name=Landsman1999/> In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases.<ref name=Landsman1999/> Juries go through a selection process called ''voir dire'' in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make \"challenges for cause\" and \"peremptory challenges\" to remove jurors.  Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror.  Since the 1970s \"[[scientific jury selection]]\" has become popular.<ref name=Landsman1999/>\n\nUnanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases.<ref name=Landsman1999/> When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a ''hung jury''), a [[Mistrials|mistrial]] is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'',<ref>''Ring v. Arizona'', {{ussc|536|284|2002}}</ref> which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/342 Unanimous Jury Votes for Life Sentence, but Alabama Judge Imposes Death] Death Penalty Information Center</ref>\n\nThere is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine.  Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present.  The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion.  Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial.  The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved.  In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.\n\nIn a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in \"capital\" murder cases.  Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing.  The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.<ref>This power is often used in drug cases \"''to impose an enhanced sentence ... based on the sentencing judge's determination of a fact that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant''\".

When [[capital punishment in Canada]] was abolished in 1976, as part of the same raft of reforms, the ''Criminal Code'' was also amended to grant juries the ability to recommend periods of [[parole ineligibility]] immediately following a guilty verdict in [[second-degree murder]] cases; however, these recommendations are usually ignored, based on the idea that judges are better-informed about relevant facts and sentencing jurisprudence and, unlike the jury, permitted to give reasons for their judgments.<ref name=second>{{cite journal|title=The Origins, Evolution and Puzzling Irrelevance of Jury Recommendations in Second-Degree Murder Sentencing|date=2015|volume=40|number=2|journal=Queen's Law Journal|author=Rankin, Micah B.}}</ref>\n\nProponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.<ref name=booker/> Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.<ref name=statutory/>\n\n===History===\n====Rise of jury sentencing====\nThe impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nVirginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution of Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas Jefferson#Minister to France|Jefferson was in France]].<ref name=origins/>\n\nSentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should \"suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776\u20131845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}</ref> Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.<ref name=origins/>\n\nIn contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.<ref name=origins/>\n\nThe adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nDuring the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The\nchange to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.<ref name=grab/>\n\nIndiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.<ref name=origins/>\n\n====Decline of jury sentencing====\nThe 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nThese systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.2307/1600541|jstor=1600541|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol70/iss1/1}}</ref>\n\n[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults.

It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.<ref name=case/>\n\nFurthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.<ref name=statutory>{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134\u20131172|doi=10.2307/1120351|jstor=1120351}}</ref> In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of an intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.\n\nGeorgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937\u20131939, and from 1913\u20131923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]].

Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.<ref name=democratic/> Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|racial disparity in sentencing]].<ref name=idea>{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775\u20131803|doi=10.2307/797450|jstor=797450|url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/ylj/vol108/iss7/16}}</ref>\n\nAlso, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]].

Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible.

Proponent [[Joe Morrissey]] said, \"Juries are unpredictable . . . You have much more stability with the judge doing the sentencing.\"\n\n===Arguments for and against jury sentencing===\n<!--Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.<ref name=origins/> Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.<ref name=idea/>\n\n-->An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.<ref name=booker>{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga.

Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nIt is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since \"one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations.\"<ref name=case>{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}</ref>\n\nAccording to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nAn advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nIn jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway.

The lists may be electoral rolls (i.e., a list of registered voters in the locale), people who have driver's licenses or other relevant data bases.  When selected, being a member of a jury pool is, in principle, compulsory. Prospective jurors are sent a  [[summons]] and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date.\n\nHowever, jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness, prior commitments that can't be abandoned without hardship, change of address to outside the court's jurisdiction, travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty, and others. Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors.  Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty. Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&topic=JurMan ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427204517/http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&topic=JurMan |date=April 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States jurors for [[grand juries]] are selected from jury pools.\n\nSelection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk.  Depending on the type of trial\u2014whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States\u2014anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in voir dire, pronounced {{IPA-fr|vwa\u0281 di\u0281|}} in French, and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn.  At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial.  The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial.  These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.\n\nAfter each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of some or all prospective jurors.  Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration. Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire.  The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials.  A jury is formed, then, of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen.  Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.\n\n==Jury behavior==\n\nScholarly research on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror, rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied.<ref>Patrick J. Bayer, Randi Hjalmarsson, Shamena Anwar, \"Jury Discrimination in Criminal Trials\" (September 2010) Economic Research Initiatives at Duke (ERID) Working Papers Series No. 55 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1673994</ref> Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.\n\n==Jury effectiveness==\n\nAs much of the research on social [[conformity]] suggests, individuals tend to lose their sense of individuality when faced with powerful group forces (i.e., [[Normative social influence|normative influence]]; [[Social proof|informational influence]]; interpersonal influence).<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D.R. 2010.

Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-534-36822-0}}</ref> This raises the question if the effectiveness of jury decision-making compromised by individuals\u2019 tendencies to conform to the normative transmissions of a group.\n\nSince a clear [[archetype]] for determining guilt does not exist, the criminal justice system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it is virtually impossible to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.<ref name=\"Forsyth\" />\n\n===The role of a juror===\n\nEvidence has shown that jurors typically take their roles very seriously.<ref name=Simon>Simon, R.

Juries developed in England during the Middle Ages, and are a hallmark of the [[Common law|Anglo-American common law]] legal system. They are still commonly used today in [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and other countries whose legal systems are descended from England's legal traditions. \n\nMost trial juries are \"petit juries\", and usually consist of twelve people. A larger jury known as a [[grand jury]] was used to investigate potential crimes and render indictments against suspects, but all common law countries except the United States and [[Liberia]] have phased these out. The modern criminal court jury arrangement has evolved out of the medieval juries in England. Members were supposed to inform themselves of crimes and then of the details of the crimes. Their function was therefore closer to that of a grand jury than that of a [[trial by jury|jury in a trial]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''jury'' derives from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''jur\u00e9'' (\"sworn\"). Juries are most common in [[common law]] [[Adversarial system|adversarial-system]] [[jurisdiction]]s. In the modern system, juries act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]], while judges act as triers of law (but see [[Jury#Jury nullification|nullification]]). A trial without a jury (in which both questions of fact and [[Question of law|questions of law]] are decided by a judge) is known as a [[bench trial]].\n\n==Types of jury==\n\n===Petit jury===\n{{main|Petit jury}}\nThe \"petit jury\" (or \"trial jury\", sometimes \"petty jury\") hears the [[evidence]] in a [[trial]] as presented by both the [[plaintiff]] (petitioner) and the [[defendant]] (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often [[jury instructions]] from the [[judge]], the group retires for [[deliberation]], to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or [[supermajority]]. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a [[hung jury]]. The size of the jury varies; in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors.\n\nIn [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] many trials require fewer than twelve jurors.\n\n===Grand jury===\n{{main|Grand jury}}\nA grand jury, a type of jury now confined almost exclusively to federal courts and some state jurisdictions in the United States, determines whether there is enough evidence for a [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] to go forward. Grand juries carry out this duty by examining evidence presented to them by a [[prosecutor]] and issuing [[indictment]]s, or by investigating alleged [[crime]]s and issuing [[Wiktionary:presentment|presentments]]. A grand jury is traditionally larger than and distinguishable from the petit jury used during a trial, usually with 12 jurors. It is not required that a suspect be notified of grand jury proceedings.  Grand juries can also be used for filing charges in the form of a [[sealed indictment]] against unaware suspects who are arrested later by a surprise police visit.\n\nIn addition to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting in the investigation of crimes, grand juries in California, Florida,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamisao.com/publications/grandjuryreports.htm |title=CURRENT GRAND JURY REPORTS \u2013 Miami Dade Office of the State Attorney |publisher=Miamisao.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the [[Government Accountability Office]] in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.\n\n===Coroner's jury===\n{{main|Coroner's jury}}\nA third kind of jury, known as a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law jurisdiction in connection with an [[inquest]] by a [[coroner]].  A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases.  A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis in order to increase public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy.<ref>See, e.g., Section 1245.1 of Pennsylvania's codified laws regarding coroners. http://www.pacoroners.org/Laws.php</ref>  In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.<ref>See, e.g., Inquest Schedule, Jury Findings and Vedicts (2013) of British Columbia. http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/coroners/schedule/index.htm (retrieved March 8, 2013)</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\nServing on a jury is normally compulsory for individuals who are qualified for jury service. A jury is intended to be an impartial panel capable of reaching a verdict. Procedures and requirements may include a fluent understanding of the language and the opportunity to test jurors' neutrality or otherwise exclude jurors who are perceived as likely to be less than neutral or partial to one side. Juries are initially chosen randomly, usually from the eligible population of adult citizens residing in the court's jurisdictional area. [[Jury selection]] in the United States usually includes organized questioning of the prospective jurors (jury pool) by the lawyers for the plaintiff and the defendant and by the judge\u2014[[voir dire]]\u2014as well as rejecting some jurors because of bias or inability to properly serve (\"challenge for cause\"), and the discretionary right of each side to reject a specified number of jurors without having to prove a proper cause for the rejection (\"peremptory challenge\"), before the jury is [[wikt:impanel|impaneled]].\n\nA head juror is called the \"foreperson\", \"foreman\" or \"presiding juror\". The foreperson may be chosen before the trial begins, or at the beginning of the jury's deliberations. The foreperson may be selected by the judge or by vote of the jurors, depending on the jurisdiction. The foreperson's role may include asking questions (usually to the judge) on behalf of the jury, [[Facilitator|facilitating]] jury discussions, and announcing the verdict of the jury.\n\nSince there is always the possibility of jurors not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate jurors are selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless one or more of the impaneled jurors are removed from the jury.  In Connecticut, alternate jurors are dismissed before the panel of sworn jurors begin deliberation.  Connecticut General Statutes 51\u2013243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate jurors to be segregated from the regular sworn jurors. In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51\u2013243(e) provides that alternate jurors \"shall be dismissed.\" This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate jurors, and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.\n\nWhen an insufficient number of summoned jurors appear in court to handle a matter, the law in many jurisdictions empowers the jury commissioner or other official convening the jury to involuntarily impress bystanders in the vicinity of the place where the jury is to be convened to serve on the jury.<ref>See, e.g., Sections 13-71-112 and 30-10-607, Colorado Revised Statutes</ref>\n\n==Historical roots==\n[[File:The Jury by John Morgan.jpg|thumb|''The Jury'', an 1861 painting of a British jury]]\n\nThe modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the [[vehmic court]] system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the [[Norman Conquest]], some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.\n\nThe modern [[jury trial]] evolved out of this custom in the mid-12th century during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].<ref>W.L. Warren, \"Henry II\" University of California Press,(1973)</ref>  Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an \"ancient institution\" even then in some parts of England, at the same time as Members consisted of representatives of the basic units of local government\u2014[[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]]s (an administrative sub-division of the [[shire]], embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood.  The [[Assize of Clarendon]] in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country.  The jury in this period was \"self-informing,\" meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to know the facts before coming to court.  The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay.<ref>Daniel Klerman, [http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf \"Was the Jury Every Self-Informing\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719013900/http://lawweb.usc.edu/users/dklerman/documents/Klerman.Self-informing.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }} Southern California Law Review 77: (2003), 123.</ref> \n\nBetween 1166 and 1179 new procedures including a division of functions between the sheriff, the jury of local men, and the royal justices ushered in the era of the [[English Common Law]].  Sheriffs prepared cases for trial and found jurors with relevant knowledge and testimony.  Jurors 'found' a verdict by witnessing as to fact, even assessing and applying information from their own and community memory\u2014little was written at this time and what was, such as deeds and writs, were subject to fraud.  Royal justices supervised trials, answered questions as to law, and announced the court's decision which was then subject to appeal.  Sheriffs executed the decision of the court. These procedures enabled Henry II to delegate authority without endowing his subordinates with too much power. (\"Henry II\" 293)\n\nIn 1215 the [[Catholic Church]] removed its sanction from all forms of the ordeal\u2014procedures by which suspects up to that time were 'tested' as to guilt (e.g., in the ordeal of hot metal, molten metal was sometimes poured into a suspected thief's hand.  If the wound healed rapidly and well, it was believed God found the suspect innocent, and if not then the suspect was found guilty).  With trial by ordeal banned, establishing guilt would have been problematic had England not had forty years of judicial experience.  Justices were by then accustomed to asking jurors of presentment about points of fact in assessing indictments; it was a short step to ask jurors if they concluded the accused was guilty as charged. (\"Henry II\" 358)\n\nAn early reference to a jury type group in England is in a decree issued by Aethelred at Wantage (997), which provided that in every Hundred \"the twelve leading [[thegn]]s together with the [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] shall go out and swear on the [[relic]]s which are given into their hands, that they will not accuse any innocent man nor shield a guilty one.\"<ref>Oxford History of England, 2nd ed 1955, vol III Domesday Book to Magna Carta, A l Poole, pp.397\u2013398.</ref> The resulting [[\u00c6thelred the Unready#Origin of the jury|Wantage Code]] formally recognized legal customs that were part of the [[Danelaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|title=Wantage Church History|last=Garnish|first=Lis|year=1995|work=Local History Series|publisher=[[Vale and Downland Museum]]|accessdate=2009-09-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925045004/http://www.wantage.com/museum/Local_History/Wantage%20Church%20History.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe testimonial concept can also be traced to [[Normandy]] before 1066 when a jury of nobles was established to decide land disputes. In this manner, the Duke, being the largest land owner, could not act as a judge in his own case.<ref>See, for example, discussions of the Brunner theory of testimonial, rather than judicial participation as jury origin, explored in MacNair, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.3/macnair.html ''Vicinage and the Antecedents of the Jury \u2013 I. Theories''], in Law and History Review, Vol. 17 No 3, 1999, pp. 6\u201318.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest antecedents of modern jury systems is the jury in [[ancient Greece]], including the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Athens]], where records of jury courts date back to 500 [[BCE]]. These juries voted by [[secret ballot]] and were eventually granted the power to annul [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] laws, thus introducing the practice of [[judicial review]]. In modern justice systems, the law is considered \"self-contained\" and \"distinct from other coercive forces, and perceived as separate from the political life of the community,\" but \"all these barriers are absent in the context of classical Athens. In practice and in conception the law and its administration are in some important respects indistinguishable from the life of the community in general.\"<ref>Carey, Christopher. \"Legal Space in Classical Athens.\" ''Greece & Rome'' 41(2): October  1994, pp. 172\u2013186.</ref>\n\nIn juries of the [[Justice in Eyre|Justices in Eyre]], the [[bailiff]] of the hundred would choose 4 electors who in turn chose 12 others from their hundred, and from these were selected 12 jurors.<ref>{{cite book | title= A History of English Law | volume= 1 | first= William Searle | last= Holdsworth | authorlink= William Searle Holdsworth | pages= 268\u2013269 | year= 1922 | publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] | edition= 3 | oclc= 48555551 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DQF-ASQE7xAC&pg=PA268 | ref= harv}}</ref>\n\n===18th century England===\nIn 1730, the British Parliament passed the Bill for Better Regulation of Juries.<ref>Dowlen, Oliver. Sorted: Civic Lotteries and the Future of Public Participation. (MASS LBP: Toronto, 2008) pp 38</ref> The Act stipulated that the list of all those liable for jury service was to be posted in each parish and that jury panels would be selected by lot, also known as [[sortition]], from these lists. Its aim was to prevent middle-class citizens from evading their responsibilities by financially putting into question the neutrality of the under-sheriff, the official entrusted with impaneling juries.\n\nPrior to the Act, the main means of ensuring impartiality was by allowing legal challenges to the sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality but had the effect of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.\n\nThe example of early 18th century England legal reform shows how civic lotteries can be used to organize the duties and responsibilities of the citizen body in relation to the state. It established the impartiality and neutrality of juries as well as reiterating the dual nature of the citizen-state relationship. The need for a leader/organizer in a jury is very important, in order to get a proper and agreed verdict.\n\n===19th century England===\nIn 1825, the rules concerning juror selection were consolidated. Property qualifications and various other rules were standardised, although an exemption was left open for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts.<ref name=\"Juries Act 1825, s50\">{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1825/50/pdfs/ukpga_18250050_en.pdf}}</ref> This reflected a more general understanding that local officials retained a large amount of discretion regarding which people they actually summoned.

The exemption which had been created by the 1825 Act for towns which \"possessed\" their own courts meant ten towns were free to ignore the property qualifications. This amplified in these towns the general understanding that local officials had a free hand in summoning freely from among those people who were qualified to be jurors. In 1920, three of these ten towns - Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottingham - consistently empanelled assize juries of six men and six women; while at the Bristol, Exeter, and Norwich assizes no women were empanelled at all.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crosby |first1=Kevin |title=Restricting the Juror Franchise in 1920s England and Wales |journal=Law and History Review |date=2019 |volume=37 |issue=1 |page=195 |doi=10.1017/S0738248018000639|url=https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=247766/84A91BAF-7996-4285-921C-85219429B434.pdf&pub_id=247766 }}</ref> This quickly led to a tightening up of the rules, and an abolition of these ten towns' discretion. After 1922, trial juries throughout England had to satisfy the same qualifications; although it was not until the 1980s that a centralised system was designed for selecting jurors from among the people who were qualified to serve.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Cheryl |last2=Lloyd-Bostock |first2=Sally |title=The Continuing Decline of the English Jury |journal=N Vidmar (Ed), World Jury Systems (OUP 2000)}}</ref> This meant there was still a great amount of discretion in the hands of local officials.\n\n==Trial jury size==\n[[File:Jury duty.jpg|300px|thumb|right|About 50 prospective jurors awaiting jury selection]]\n\nThe size of the jury is to provide a \"cross-section\" of the public. In ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|399|78|1970}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that a [[Florida]] [[State law (United States)|state]] jury of six was sufficient, that \"the 12-man panel is not a necessary ingredient of \"trial by jury,\" and that respondent's refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law \"did not violate petitioner's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights as [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|applied]] to the States through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]].\"<ref>''Williams'', at 86</ref> In ''[[Ballew v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|435|223|1978}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the number of jurors could not be reduced below six.\n\nIn ''Brownlee v The Queen'' (2001) 207 CLR 278, the [[High Court of Australia]] unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of \"trial by jury\" in section 80 of the [[Australian Constitution]].\n\nIn [[Scotland]], a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors, which is thought to be the largest in the world. In 2009 a review by the [[Scottish Government]] regarding the possibility of reduction<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7368294.stm Review could reduce jury numbers] BBC News, 26 April 2008</ref> led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it \"uniquely right\".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Scotland39s-unique-15strong--juries.5252536.jp Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished] The Scotsman, 11 May 2009</ref> Trials in the [[Republic of Ireland]] which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.\n\nA study by the [[University of Glasgow]] suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.<ref>''Is \"The More the Merrier?\"'', [[Mental Floss]], November\u2013December 2011, p. 74</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Verkaik|first1=Robert|title=Juries 'swayed by dominant speakers'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/juries-swayed-by-dominant-speakers-9167289.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=Independent|date=September 3, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Uhlig|first1=Robert|title=Juries are 'too large for correct verdicts'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339399/Juries-are-too-large-for-correct-verdicts.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=September 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Integrity==\nFor juries to fulfill their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from [[Mass media|media]] or the Internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a [[crime scene]]). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute [[reversible error]]. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.\n\nJurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in [[Confidentiality|strict confidence]] during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In Canadian and [[English law]], the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be [[contempt of court]], a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.\n\nBecause of the importance of preventing [[undue influence]] on a jury, [[jury tampering]] (like [[witness tampering]]) is a serious crime, whether attempted through [[bribery]], [[Assault (tort)|threat of violence]], or other means. Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality.\n\n==Role==\nThe role of the jury is described as that of a [[finder of fact]], while the judge is seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable.  Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a \"special verdict.\"  A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a \"general verdict.\"\n\nJuries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A Norms Approach to Jury \"Nullification:\" Interests, Values, and Scripts|author=Sanders, Joseph|volume=30|issue=1|pages=12\u201345|date=16 January 2008|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105085320/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9930.2008.00268.x|journal=Law & Policy}}</ref> A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases.  For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence.  Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove.  It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts.  However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as \"jury nullification of law\" or simply [[jury nullification]]. When there is no jury (\"bench trial\"), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.\n\nThe collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:\n<blockquote>\nDetailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts\u2019 testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html Jury Trials: In Favor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128052243/http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html |date=2010-11-28 }} eJournal USA, Anatomy of a Jury Trial, 1 July 2009</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues.  This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant's sentence if the defendant is convicted.  This practice was required in all [[death penalty]] cases in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, where the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}} resulted in the Supreme Court's expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\".<ref>''Apprendi'', at 490</ref>\n\nMany U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an [[advisory jury]] in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge,<ref>See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011); Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011).</ref> although this procedural tool is rarely used.  For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as \"pain and suffering\" damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving \"equitable\" rather than \"legal\" claims.\n\nIn Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing.  The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down.  In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee<ref>Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-20-104, 40-20-107</ref> and Texas,<ref>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.07 Sec. 1(b)</ref> juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.\n\nHowever, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law.  The exception is the award of [[damages]] in English law [[Slander and libel|libel]] cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.\n\nIn legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known are entitled to great deference on appeal.  In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems, evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact.  The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has a major impact on court procedure in these systems.  This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition.  The higher the stakes, the more this is true.  Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.\n\n==Jury nullification==\n{{Main|Jury nullification}}\n\n''Jury nullification'' means deciding not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case by jury decision.  In other words, it is \"the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=jury nullification definition \u2013 Dictionary \u2013 MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207015043/http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archivedate=2010-12-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker [[William Penn]] which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one [[Carnegie of Finhaven]] who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish [[Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]].  As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been \"proven\" and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing.  Instead, the jury asserted what is believed to be their \"ancient right\" to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of \"not guilty\". This led to the development of the not proven verdict in ''[[Scots law]].''\n\nToday in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge's instructions concerning what is the law and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court.  Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving [[slavery]] (see [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]), [[freedom of the press]] (see [[John Peter Zenger]]), and [[freedom of religion]] (see [[William Penn#Persecutions|William Penn]]).\n\nIn ''[[United States v. Moylan]]'', {{West|F|417|2|1002|4th. Cir.|1969|}}, [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal]] unanimously ruled: \"If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision.\"  The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]] is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law.  In ''[[Sparf v. the United States]]'', {{ussc|156|51|1895}}, the Supreme Court, in a 5\u20134 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.\n\nModern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.<ref>[http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/46-2/articles/parmenter-andrew.pdf Nullifying the Jury: \"The Judicial Oligarchy\" Declares War on Jury Nullification] [[Washburn Law Journal]] May 2, 2007, </ref>\n\n===Jury equity===\nIn the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called \"jury equity\". This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge \u2013 thus a jury has the power to influence the law.\n\nThe standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book \"Trial by Jury\". Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is \"the lamp that shows that freedom lives\" and that it is a \"little parliament\".<ref>[https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf Patrick Devlin, 'Trial by Jury'] (Stevens & Sons 1956)</ref> The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/13538022/Controlling_Devlins_Jury_what_the_jury_thinks_and_what_the_jury_sees_online_published_2012_ Kevin Crosby, 'Controlling Devlin's Jury: what the jury thinks, and what the jury sees online'] [2012] Criminal Law Review 15</ref> Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control is set in stone.\n\nPerhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in [[England and Wales]] was the acquittal of [[Clive Ponting]], on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] in 1985. Mr. Ponting's defense was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that \"the public interest is what the government of the day says it is\" \u2013 effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nAnother example is the acquittal in 1989 of [[Michael Randle]] and [[Pat Pottle]], who confessed in open court to charges of springing the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]] [[George Blake]] from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs Prison]] and smuggling him to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case, compounded by its cynical untimeliness.<ref name = \"New Statesman\">[http://www.newstatesman.com/200010090010  New Statesman], 2000-10-09.</ref>\n\nIn Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the \"not guilty\" verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the \"not guilty\" verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the \"not proven\" verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.<ref name=\"Luckhurst\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|last=Luckhurst|first=Tim|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=The Sunday Times, TimesOnline|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence.

Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad-hoc body in the executive branch of a government. Outside government, a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in [[competition]], such as at a [[wine tasting]], [[art exhibition]], talent contest, or [[Reality television|reality game show]]. These types of contests are [[Juried (competition)|juried competitions]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nBlue ribbon juries are juries selected from prominent, well-educated citizens, sometimes to investigate a particular problem such as civic corruption. Blue ribbon juries cannot be used in real trials, which require constitutional safeguards to produce a jury of one's peers. The blue-ribbon jury is intended to overcome the problems of ordinary juries in interpreting complex technical or commercial questions.  In the United States, blue-ribbon juries were provided for by statutes, the terms varying by jurisdiction.\n\n==Trial procedures==\n\n===Australia===\n\n====States====\nEach [[States and territories of Australia|state]] may determine the extent to which the use of a jury is used.

A tied vote result in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty \u2013 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'.

During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure.

Criminal cases are normally tried by a 7-person jury and sometimes, at the discretion of the court, a 9-person jury. Nevertheless, the Jury Ordinance requires that a jury in any proceedings should be composed of at least 5 jurors.\n\nAlthough article 86 of the basic law states that \u2018the principle of trial by jury previously practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained\u2019, it does not guarantee that every case is to be tried by a jury.

Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; in order to be eligible as a lay judge for the ''Corte d'Assise'', however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the lay judge must have completed his/her education at the ''Scuola Media'' (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the ''Corte d'Assise d'Appello'' (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the ''Scuola Superiore'' (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the [[stipend]]iary judges and \"Lay Judges\" together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named ''Camera di Consiglio'' (\"Counsel Chamber\"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact  lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them.  The ''Corte d'Assise'' has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include [[terrorism]], murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. [[assisted suicide]]), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the \"Lay Judges\" generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include [[life sentences]].\n\n===New Zealand===\nJuries are used in trials for all trials involving Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries may be used in trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases, juries are only used in cases of defamation, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11\u20131 or 10\u20131) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9\u20133 or 9\u20132) in civil cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=NZ's first majority guilty verdict|publisher=Stuff|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2563945/NZs-first-majority-guilty-verdict|accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref>\n\n===Norway===\nJuries existed in Norway as early as the year 800, and perhaps even earlier.\nThey brought the jury system to [[England]] and Scotland. Juries were phased out as late as the 17th century, when Norway's central government was in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].\nThough Norway and Denmark had different legal systems throughout their personal union (1387\u20131536), and later under the governmental union (1536\u20131814), there was attempt to harmonize the legal systems of the two countries. Even if juries were abolished, the layman continued to play an important role in the legal system throughout in Norway.\n\nThe jury was reintroduced in 1887, and was then solely used in criminal cases on the second tier of the three-tier Norwegian court system (\"[[Court of appeal (Norway)|Lagmannsretten]]\"). The jury consisted of 10 people, and had to reach a majority verdict consisting of seven or more of the jurors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lov om rettergangsm\u00e5ten i straffesaker (Straffeprosessloven)|publisher=Lovdata|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-039.html|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> The jury never gave a reason for its verdict, rather it simply gave a \"guilty\" or \"non-guilty\" verdict.\n\nIn a sense, the concept of being judged by one's peers existed on both the first and second tier of the Norwegian court system: In [[Tingretten]], one judge and two lay judges preside, and in Lagmannsretten two judges and five lay judges preside. The lay judges do not hold any legal qualification, and represent the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of lay judges always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]], only [[Candidate of Law|trained lawyers]] are seated.\n\n===Spain===\n\nSpain has no strong tradition of using juries. However we can find mentions in the [[Bayonne Statute]]. Later, Article 307 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] allowed the ''Cortes'' to pass legislation if they felt that over the time it was needed to distinguish between \"judges of law\" and \"judges of facts\". Such legislation however was never enacted.\n\nArticle 2 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1837]] while proclamating the freedom of the people to publicate written contents without previous censorship according to the laws also provided that \"press crimes\" could only be tried by juries. This meant that a ''grand jury'' would need to indict, and a ''petit jury'' would need to convict.\n\nJuries were later abolished in 1845, but were later restored in 1869 for all \"political crimes\" and \"those common crimes the law may deem appropriate to be so tried by a jury\". A Law concerning the Jury entered into force on January 1, 1899 and lasted until 1936, where juries were again disbanded with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe actual [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution of 1978]] permits the ''Cortes Generales'' to pass legislation allowing juries in criminal trials. The provision is arguably somewhat vague: ''\"Article 125 \u2013 Citizens may engage in popular action and participate in the administration of justice through the institution of the Jury, in the manner and with respect to those criminal trials as may be determined by law, as well as in customary and traditional courts.\"''\n\nJury trials can only happen in the criminal jurisdiction and it is not a choice of the defendant to be tried by jury, or by a single judge or a panel of judges. Organic Law 5/1995, of May 22<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-12095 |title=Ley Org\u00e1nica 5/1995, de 22 de mayo, del Tribunal del Jurado. |language=Spanish |year=1995 |access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> regulates the categories of crimes in which a trial by jury is mandatory. For all other crimes, a single judge or a panel of judges will decide both on facts and the law. Spanish juries are composed of 9 citizens and a professional Judge. Juries decide on facts and whether to convict or acquit the defendant. In case of conviction they can also make recommendations such as if the defendant should be pardoned if they asked to, or if they think the defendant could be released on parole, etc.\n\nOne of the first jury trial cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 for the murder of two police officers. After a confused{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. This verdict shocked the nation.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/1997/03/07/espana/07N0018.html ESPA\u00d1A | Juicio a Mikel Otegi por asesinar a dos ertzainas.

In these cases 6 out of 9 jurors must find against the defendant, and may not be overruled in cases of acquittal.\n\nSweden has no tradition of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is in cases involving freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution.<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222143058/http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_PageExtended____6337.aspx |date=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. These cases are tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.\n\nThe jury in press freedom cases rules only on the facts of the case and the question of guilt or innocence. The trial judge may overrule a jury's guilty verdict, but may not overrule an acquittal. A conviction requires a majority verdict of 6\u20133. Sentencing is the sole prerogative of judges.\n\nJury members must be Swedish citizens and resident in the county in which the case is being heard. They must be of sound judgement and known for their independence and integrity. Combined, they should represent a range of social groups and opinions, as well as all parts of the county. It is the county council that have the responsibility to appoints juries for a tenure of four years under which they may serve in multiple cases. The appointed jurymen are divided into two groups, in most counties the first with sixteen members and the second with eight. From this pool of available jurymen the court hears and excludes those with conflicts of interest in the case, after which the defendants and plaintiffs have the right to exclude a number of members, varying by county and group. The final jury is then randomly selected by drawing of lots.<ref>[http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tryckfrihetsforordning-19491_sfs-1949-105/ Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordning (1949:105-SFS 2010:1409)] ''Riksdagen'' {{in lang|sv}}</ref><ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sw03000_.html The Freedom of the Press Act/Sweden] ''The International Constitutional Law Project''</ref>\n\nJuries are not used in other criminal and civil cases. For most other cases in the first and second tier courts lay judges sit alongside professional judges. Lay judges participate in deciding both the facts of the case and sentencing. Lay judges are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-penal-2001-1-page-355.htm |title=The advantages and disadvantages of lay judges from a Swedish perspective |publisher=Cairn.info |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> Lay judges are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.blinamndeman.se/Bli-namndeman/Sa-blir-du-vald/ | title=S\u00e5 blir du vald - Bli n\u00e4mndeman}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\n{{main|Juries in England and Wales}}\nIn England and Wales jury trials are used for criminal cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as expensive and time-consuming.<ref>Lloyd-Bostock S, Thomas C.

First the prosecution leads evidence from witnesses and after each witness the defence has an opportunity to cross examine.  Following the Prosecution case, the defence may move a motion of [[no case to answer]] if the worst the prosecution has been able to lead in evidence would be insufficient to convict of any crime.  If there remains a case to answer, the defence leads evidence from witnesses in an attempt to refute previous evidence led by the prosecution, with cross examination being permitted after each witness. Once both prosecution and defence have concluded leading evidence, the case goes to summing up where firstly the prosecution and then the defence get to sum up their case based on the evidence that has been heard.  The jury is given guidance on points of law and then sent out to consider its verdict. Juries are composed of fifteen residents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Was I Picked For Jury Service? |publisher=Courtroom Advice|url=http://www.courtroomadvice.co.uk/why-was-I-picked-for-jury-service.html|accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Juries in the United States}}\nIn criminal law in federal courts and a minority of state court systems of the United States, a grand jury is convened to hear only [[testimony]] and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine whether there is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial.  In each court district where a grand jury is required, a group of 16\u201323 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious.  If a grand jury rejects a proposed indictment the grand jury's action is known as a \"no bill.\"  If they accept a proposed indictment, the grand jury's action is known as a \"true bill.\"  Grand jury proceedings are ''ex parte'': only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the grand jury and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the grand jury, and hearsay evidence is permitted.  This is so because a grand jury cannot convict a defendant.  It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial.  Grand juries vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new grand jury if a \"no bill\" was returned by a previous grand jury.  A typical grand jury considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes.  In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a grand jury may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the grand jury investigation involves a public scandal.  Historically, grand juries were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.\n\nBoth [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III of the U.S. Constitution]] and the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] require that criminal cases be tried by a jury.<ref name=\"King1999\">{{cite journal | author = King NJ | title = The American Criminal Jury |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&+Contemp.+Probs.+41+(Spring+1999) | year = 1999 | pages = 41\u201367 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192252 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192252}}</ref>  Originally this applied only to federal courts.  However, the Fourteenth Amendment extended this mandate to the states.  Although the Constitution originally did not require a jury for civil cases, this led to an uproar which was followed by adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], which requires a civil jury in cases where the value in dispute is greater than twenty dollars.<ref name=\"Landsman1999\">{{cite journal | author = Landsman S. | year = 1999 | title = The Civil Jury in America |  journal = Law and Contemporary Problems | url = https://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?62+Law+&+Contemp.+Probs.+285+(Spring+1999) | pages = 285\u2013304 | volume = 62 | accessdate = 2009-06-04 | doi = 10.2307/1192260 | issue = 2 | jstor = 1192260}}</ref> However, the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial does not apply in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], where the right to a jury is strictly a matter of state law.<ref>Amar, A.R. (1998). ''The Bill of Rights''. New Haven, CT: Yale University. pp. 81\u2013118.</ref>  However, in practice, all states except Louisiana preserve the right to a jury trial in almost all civil cases where the sole remedy sought is money damages to the same extent as jury trials are permitted by the Seventh Amendment.  Under the law of many states, jury trials are not allowed in small claims cases.  The civil jury in the United States is a defining element of the process by which personal injury trials are handled.\n\nIn practice, even though the defendant in a criminal action is entitled to a trial by jury, most criminal actions in the U.S. are resolved by [[plea bargain]].<ref name=\"plea\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |title=Plea Bargains and the Role of Judges |work=2008 National Convention Breakout Session |publisher=The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007220413/http://www.acslaw.org/node/6789 |archivedate=2009-10-07 }}</ref>  Only about 2% of civil cases go to trial, with only about half of those trials being conducted before juries.\n\nIn 1898 the Supreme Court held that the jury must be composed of at least twelve persons, although this was not necessarily extended to state civil jury trials.<ref name=Landsman1999/> In 1970, however, the Supreme Court held that the twelve person requirement was a \"historical accident\", and upheld six-person juries if provided for under state law in both criminal and civil state court cases. There is controversy over smaller juries, with proponents arguing that they are more efficient and opponents arguing that they lead to fluctuating verdicts.<ref name=Landsman1999/> In a later case, however, the court rejected the use of five-person juries in criminal cases.<ref name=Landsman1999/> Juries go through a selection process called ''voir dire'' in which the lawyers question the jurors and then make \"challenges for cause\" and \"peremptory challenges\" to remove jurors.  Traditionally the removal of jurors based on a peremptory challenge required no justification or explanation, but the tradition has been changed by the Supreme Court where the reason for the peremptory challenge was the race of the potential juror.  Since the 1970s \"[[scientific jury selection]]\" has become popular.<ref name=Landsman1999/>\n\nUnanimous jury verdicts have been standard in US American law. This requirement was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1897, but the standard was relaxed in 1972 in two criminal cases. As of 1999 over thirty states had laws allowing less than unanimity in civil cases, but Oregon and Louisiana are the only states which have laws allowing less than unanimous jury verdicts for criminal cases.<ref name=Landsman1999/> When the required number of jurors cannot agree on a verdict (a situation sometimes referred to as a ''hung jury''), a [[Mistrials|mistrial]] is declared, and the case may be retried with a newly constituted jury. The practice generally was that the jury rules only on questions of fact and guilt; setting the penalty was reserved for the judge. This practice was confirmed by rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court such as in ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'',<ref>''Ring v. Arizona'', {{ussc|536|284|2002}}</ref> which found Arizona's practice of having the judge decide whether aggravating factors exist to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty, to be unconstitutional, and reserving the determination of whether the aggravating factors exist to be decided by the jury. However, in some states (such as Alabama and Florida), the ultimate decision on the punishment is made by the judge, and the jury gives only a non-binding recommendation. The judge can impose the death penalty even if the jury recommends life without parole.<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/342 Unanimous Jury Votes for Life Sentence, but Alabama Judge Imposes Death] Death Penalty Information Center</ref>\n\nThere is no set format for jury deliberations, and the jury takes a period of time to settle into discussing the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine.  Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present.  The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The jury will then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion.  Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial.  The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved.  In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.\n\nIn a few states and in death penalty cases, depending upon the law, the trial jury, or sometimes a separate jury, may determine whether the death penalty is appropriate in \"capital\" murder cases.  Usually, sentencing is handled by the judge at a separate hearing.  The judge may but does not always follow the recommendations of the jury when deciding on a sentence.<ref>This power is often used in drug cases \"''to impose an enhanced sentence ... based on the sentencing judge's determination of a fact that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant''\".

When [[capital punishment in Canada]] was abolished in 1976, as part of the same raft of reforms, the ''Criminal Code'' was also amended to grant juries the ability to recommend periods of [[parole ineligibility]] immediately following a guilty verdict in [[second-degree murder]] cases; however, these recommendations are usually ignored, based on the idea that judges are better-informed about relevant facts and sentencing jurisprudence and, unlike the jury, permitted to give reasons for their judgments.<ref name=second>{{cite journal|title=The Origins, Evolution and Puzzling Irrelevance of Jury Recommendations in Second-Degree Murder Sentencing|date=2015|volume=40|number=2|journal=Queen's Law Journal|author=Rankin, Micah B.}}</ref>\n\nProponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.<ref name=booker/> Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.<ref name=statutory/>\n\n===History===\n====Rise of jury sentencing====\nThe impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nVirginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution of Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas Jefferson#Minister to France|Jefferson was in France]].<ref name=origins/>\n\nSentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.<ref>{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should \"suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776\u20131845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}</ref> Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.<ref name=origins/>\n\nIn contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.<ref name=origins/>\n\nThe adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nDuring the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The\nchange to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.<ref name=grab/>\n\nIndiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.<ref name=origins/>\n\n====Decline of jury sentencing====\nThe 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nThese systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.2307/1600541|jstor=1600541|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol70/iss1/1}}</ref>\n\n[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nThe process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.<ref name=case/>\n\nFurthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.<ref name=statutory>{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134\u20131172|doi=10.2307/1120351|jstor=1120351}}</ref> In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of an intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.\n\nGeorgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937\u20131939, and from 1913\u20131923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]].

Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.<ref name=democratic/> Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|racial disparity in sentencing]].<ref name=idea>{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775\u20131803|doi=10.2307/797450|jstor=797450|url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/ylj/vol108/iss7/16}}</ref>\n\nAlso, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nJury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v.

The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to \"determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly\" when a defendant was \"convicted by confession.\" The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.<ref name=origins/>\n\nIn Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence.\" Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments.

You have much more stability with the judge doing the sentencing.\"\n\n===Arguments for and against jury sentencing===\n<!--Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.<ref name=origins/> Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.<ref name=idea/>\n\n-->An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.<ref name=booker>{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga.

Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nIt is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since \"one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations.\"<ref name=case>{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}</ref>\n\nAccording to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.<ref name=democratic/>\n\nAn advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service.

The lists may be electoral rolls (i.e., a list of registered voters in the locale), people who have driver's licenses or other relevant data bases.  When selected, being a member of a jury pool is, in principle, compulsory. Prospective jurors are sent a  [[summons]] and are obligated to appear in a specified jury pool room on a specified date.\n\nHowever, jurors can be released from the pool for several reasons including illness, prior commitments that can't be abandoned without hardship, change of address to outside the court's jurisdiction, travel or employment outside the jurisdiction at the time of duty, and others. Often jurisdictions pay token amounts for jury duty and many issue stipends to cover transportation expenses for jurors.  Work places cannot penalize employees who serve jury duty. Payments to jurors varies by jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&topic=JurMan ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427204517/http://www.ncsconline.org/WC/CourTopics/StateLinks.asp?id=47&topic=JurMan |date=April 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States jurors for [[grand juries]] are selected from jury pools.\n\nSelection of jurors from a jury pool occurs when a trial is announced and juror names are randomly selected and called out by the jury pool clerk.  Depending on the type of trial\u2014whether a 6-person or 12 person jury is needed, in the United States\u2014anywhere from 15 to 30 prospective jurors are sent to the courtroom to participate in voir dire, pronounced {{IPA-fr|vwa\u0281 di\u0281|}} in French, and defined as the oath to speak the truth in the examination testing competence of a juror, or in another application, a witness. Once the list of prospective jurors has assembled in the courtroom the court clerk assigns them seats in the order their names were originally drawn.  At this point the judge often will ask each prospective juror to answer a list of general questions such as name, occupation, education, family relationships, time conflicts for the anticipated length of the trial.  The list is usually written up and clearly visible to assist nervous prospective jurors and may include several questions uniquely pertinent to the particular trial.  These questions are to familiarize the judge and attorneys with the jurors and glean biases, experiences, or relationships that could jeopardize the proper course of the trial.\n\nAfter each prospective juror has answered the general slate of questions the attorneys may ask follow-up questions of some or all prospective jurors.  Each side in the trial is allotted a certain number of challenges to remove prospective jurors from consideration. Some challenges are issued during voir dire while others are presented to the judge at the end of voir dire.  The judge calls out the names of the anonymously challenged prospective jurors and those return to the pool for consideration in other trials.  A jury is formed, then, of the remaining prospective jurors in the order that their names were originally chosen.  Any prospective jurors not thus impaneled return to the jury pool room.\n\n==Jury behavior==\n\nScholarly research on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear to track the opinions of the median juror, rather than the opinions of the extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied.<ref>Patrick J. Bayer, Randi Hjalmarsson, Shamena Anwar, \"Jury Discrimination in Criminal Trials\" (September 2010) Economic Research Initiatives at Duke (ERID) Working Papers Series No. 55 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1673994</ref> Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.\n\n==Jury effectiveness==\n\nAs much of the research on social [[conformity]] suggests, individuals tend to lose their sense of individuality when faced with powerful group forces (i.e., [[Normative social influence|normative influence]]; [[Social proof|informational influence]]; interpersonal influence).<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D.R. 2010. Group Dynamics, 5th Edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|0-534-36822-0}}</ref> This raises the question if the effectiveness of jury decision-making compromised by individuals\u2019 tendencies to conform to the normative transmissions of a group.\n\nSince a clear [[archetype]] for determining guilt does not exist, the criminal justice system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it is virtually impossible to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.<ref name=\"Forsyth\" />\n\n===The role of a juror===\n\nEvidence has shown that jurors typically take their roles very seriously.<ref name=Simon>Simon, R. J. (1980). The jury: Its role in American society. Lexington, MA: Heath</ref> According to Simon (1980), jurors approach their responsibilities as decision makers much in the same way as a court judge \u2013 with great seriousness, a lawful mind, and a concern for consistency that is evidence-based. By actively processing evidence, making inferences, using common sense and personal experiences to inform their decision-making, research has indicated that jurors are effective decision makers who seek thorough understanding, rather than passive, apathetic participants unfit to serve on a jury.<ref name=Myers>{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/judicature/article10.html |title=Human Genome Project Information Site Has Been Updated |publisher=Ornl.gov |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n\n===Judge-jury agreement===\n\nEvidence supporting jury effectiveness has also been illustrated in studies that investigate the parallels between judge and jury decision-making.<ref name=Kalven>Kalven, H. & Zeisel, H. (1966). The American Jury. Boston: Little, Brown.</ref>  According to Kalven and Zeisel (1966), it is not uncommon to find that the verdicts passed down by juries following a trial match the verdicts held by the appointed judges. Upon surveying judges and jurors of approximately 8000 criminal and civil trials, it was discovered that the verdicts handed down by both parties were in agreement 80% of the time.<ref name=\"Kalven\" />\n\n===Buffering effects===\n\nJurors, like most individuals, are not free from holding social and cognitive [[List of cognitive biases|biases]]. People may negatively judge individuals who do not adhere to established [[Norm (social)|social norms]] (e.g., an individual's dress sense) or do not meet societal standards of success. Although these biases tend to influence jurors\u2019 individual decisions during a trial,<ref name=Wrightsman>Wrightsman, L., Nietzel, M. T., & Fortune, W. H. (1998). Psychology and the legal system (4th edition). Monterey, California: Brooks/Cole.</ref> while working as part of a group (i.e., jury), these biases are typically controlled.<ref name=Kerr>Kerr, N. L., & Huang, J. Y. (1986). How much difference does one juror make in jury deliberation.

One of his first national TV appearances (other than as an athlete) was in a commercial for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] [[Product 19]] cereal with his father, [[Tom Harmon]], its longstanding TV spokesman. Thanks to his sister Kristin's in-laws, [[Ozzie Nelson]] and [[Harriet Nelson]], he landed his first job as an actor in an episode of ''[[Ozzie's Girls]].'' This was followed by guest roles in episodes of ''[[Adam-12]]'', ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', and ''[[Emergency!]]'' in mid-1975. He also performed in \"905-Wild\", a [[backdoor pilot]] episode for a series about two L.A. County Animal Control Officers which did not sell.

One of his first national TV appearances (other than as an athlete) was in a commercial for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] [[Product 19]] cereal with his father, [[Tom Harmon]], its longstanding TV spokesman. Thanks to his sister Kristin's in-laws, [[Ozzie Nelson]] and [[Harriet Nelson]], he landed his first job as an actor in an episode of ''[[Ozzie's Girls]].'' This was followed by guest roles in episodes of ''[[Adam-12]]'', ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', and ''[[Emergency!]]'' in mid-1975. He also performed in \"905-Wild\", a [[backdoor pilot]] episode for a series about two L.A. County Animal Control Officers which did not sell. Producer/creator [[Jack Webb]], who was the packager of both series, later cast Harmon in ''[[Sam (1978 TV series)|Sam]]'', a short-lived 1978 series about an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer and his [[Police dog|K-9]] partner.

He then landed a co-starring role on the 1979 action series ''[[240-Robert]]'' as Deputy Dwayne Thibideaux. The series centered around the missions of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Emergency Services Detail, but was also short-lived.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/do-you-remember-the-show-240-robert|title=Do you remember the show|website=Me-TV Network|access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Harmon gained a regular role in the prime time soap opera ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', in which he played Fielding Carlisle, the husband of [[Morgan Fairchild]]'s character.
