He made 49 appearances in total, appearing at three [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments, in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] and [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], and scoring 18 goals.\n\nAsparuhov's career was cut short in 1971 at the age of 28 when he was killed in a vehicle accident. Levski Sofia's [[Vivacom Arena - Georgi Asparuhov Stadium|current stadium]] is named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | title = Georgi Asparuhov Stadium | url = https://levski.bg/history/stadium | publisher = levski.bg | language = Bulgarian}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Beginnings at Levski===\nAsparuhov began his senior career at [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]] in the end of [[1959\u201360 A Group|1959\u201360 season]] at the age of 17. He made his debut on 5 June 1960 in a 1\u20130 home loss against [[FC Lokomotiv 1929 Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]], coming on as a second-half substitute.<ref>{{cite web | title = \u0413\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0438 | url = https://levski.bg/history/gundi | publisher = levski.bg | language = Bulgarian}}</ref> His first senior goal came during the following campaign when he scored in a 1\u20131 away draw against [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]] on 28 September 1960.\n\n===Botev Plovdiv===\nIn January 1962, Asparuhov joined [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]] where he won [[1961\u201362 Bulgarian Cup]] a few months later. On 13 September 1962, he marked his European debut away at [[FCSB|Steaua Bucure\u015fti]] with two goals, but Botev lost the game 3\u20132 in their preliminary round first leg tie of [[1962\u201363 European Cup Winners' Cup|1962\u201363 Cup Winners' Cup]]. A week later, in the second leg of Botev's European tie against Steaua, Asparuhov scored his first-ever [[hat-trick]] in a resounding 5\u20131 home victory. He also scored in a 4\u20130 away win over [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 24 October 1962 and became a top scorer of the tournament with 6 goals.\n\nIn October 1963, Asparuhov returned to Levski Sofia.<ref>{{cite web | title = \u041c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0442 \u201e\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u201c | url = http://www.temasport.com/news/view/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8A%D1%82+%E2%80%9E%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B8+%D0%90%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%E2%80%9C/news:49415 | publisher = temasport.com | date = 4 May 2018 | language = Bulgarian}}</ref> \n\n===Return to Levski===\nWidely regarded as Levski's greatest ever player, Asparuhov played over 230 games for the club, winning three [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian League titles]] and three [[Bulgarian Cup]]s. During his time at the club he won the [[Bulgarian footballer of the year]] and [[Bulgarian sportsperson of the year]] in 1965. \n\nAsparuhov is Levski's third all-time leading goal scorer (153). In [[1964\u201365 A Group|1964\u201365 season]] he became the league's top scorer with 27 goals in 29 matches.\n\nSome of the top European clubs at the time sought his services. In the 1965\u201366 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], Levski played [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] (with [[Eus\u00e9bio]] in the squad). When Benfica eliminated Levski after hard-fought 3:2 and 2:2 scorelines and Gundi having netted 3 of all Levski goals (one of them Simo Nikolov), Europe began to view Gundi with interest. In fact, he was the first player to score two goals in Benfica's stadium. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] club, as well as Itaian giants [[A.C. Milan]], wanted to buy Asparuhov, but the communist government of Bulgaria did not allow them to do so.\n\nTo [[A.C. Milan]]'s emissary, regarding their offer, he answered that way:\n\n\"Tell them that there is a country named Bulgaria. In that country there is a team named Levski, you might not have heard of it. But I was born in this team and I will die in this team.\"\n\n==International career==\nAsparuhov made his debut for the [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgarian national team]] in a friendly match against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] at [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion|Praterstadion]] in [[Vienna]] on 6 May 1962<ref>{{cite web | title = Austria vs Bulgaria 2\u20130, 6 May 1962 | url = https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13226 | publisher = eu-football.info}}</ref> and  was named in the 22-man Bulgarian squad for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]]. He made his World Cup debut in the second group game against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Estadio El Teniente|Estadio Braden Copper Co.]] in [[Rancagua]] on 3 June 1962.\n\nAsparuhov scored his first goals for Bulgaria on 7 November 1962, scoring twice in a 3\u20131 home victory over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in a [[1964 European Nations' Cup qualifying]] match.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bulgaria vs Portugal 3\u20131, 7 November 1962 | url = https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13316 | publisher = eu-football.info}}</ref> Then he top scored for Bulgaria in their [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1966 World Cup qualifying campaign]] with five goals. During the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] he scored Bulgaria's only goal in a 1\u20133 loss against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Old Trafford]] in [[Manchester]].\n\n==Death==\nAsparuhov died in a car crash in 1971 with teammate [[Nikola Kotkov]].

On 13 September 1962, he marked his European debut away at [[FCSB|Steaua Bucure\u015fti]] with two goals, but Botev lost the game 3\u20132 in their preliminary round first leg tie of [[1962\u201363 European Cup Winners' Cup|1962\u201363 Cup Winners' Cup]]. A week later, in the second leg of Botev's European tie against Steaua, Asparuhov scored his first-ever [[hat-trick]] in a resounding 5\u20131 home victory. He also scored in a 4\u20130 away win over [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 24 October 1962 and became a top scorer of the tournament with 6 goals.\n\nIn October 1963, Asparuhov returned to Levski Sofia.<ref>{{cite web | title = \u041c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0442 \u201e\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u201c | url = http://www.temasport.com/news/view/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8A%D1%82+%E2%80%9E%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B8+%D0%90%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%E2%80%9C/news:49415 | publisher = temasport.com | date = 4 May 2018 | language = Bulgarian}}</ref> \n\n===Return to Levski===\nWidely regarded as Levski's greatest ever player, Asparuhov played over 230 games for the club, winning three [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian League titles]] and three [[Bulgarian Cup]]s. During his time at the club he won the [[Bulgarian footballer of the year]] and [[Bulgarian sportsperson of the year]] in 1965. \n\nAsparuhov is Levski's third all-time leading goal scorer (153). In [[1964\u201365 A Group|1964\u201365 season]] he became the league's top scorer with 27 goals in 29 matches.\n\nSome of the top European clubs at the time sought his services. In the 1965\u201366 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], Levski played [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] (with [[Eus\u00e9bio]] in the squad). When Benfica eliminated Levski after hard-fought 3:2 and 2:2 scorelines and Gundi having netted 3 of all Levski goals (one of them Simo Nikolov), Europe began to view Gundi with interest. In fact, he was the first player to score two goals in Benfica's stadium. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] club, as well as Itaian giants [[A.C. Milan]], wanted to buy Asparuhov, but the communist government of Bulgaria did not allow them to do so.\n\nTo [[A.C. Milan]]'s emissary, regarding their offer, he answered that way:\n\n\"Tell them, that there is a country Bulgaria, in that country there is one team Levski, you might have not heard of it, in this team I was born and in this team I will die.\"\n\n==International career==\nAsparuhov made his debut for the [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgarian national team]] in a friendly match against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] at [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion|Praterstadion]] in [[Vienna]] on 6 May 1962<ref>{{cite web | title = Austria vs Bulgaria 2\u20130, 6 May 1962 | url = https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13226 | publisher = eu-football.info}}</ref> and  was named in the 22-man Bulgarian squad for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]]. He made his World Cup debut in the second group game against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Estadio El Teniente|Estadio Braden Copper Co.]] in [[Rancagua]] on 3 June 1962.\n\nAsparuhov scored his first goals for Bulgaria on 7 November 1962, scoring twice in a 3\u20131 home victory over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in a [[1964 European Nations' Cup qualifying]] match.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bulgaria vs Portugal 3\u20131, 7 November 1962 | url = https://eu-football.info/_match.php?id=13316 | publisher = eu-football.info}}</ref> Then he top scored for Bulgaria in their [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1966 World Cup qualifying campaign]] with five goals. During the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] he scored Bulgaria's only goal in a 1\u20133 loss against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] at [[Old Trafford]] in [[Manchester]].\n\n==Death==\nAsparuhov died in a car crash in 1971 with teammate [[Nikola Kotkov]].

Sometimes, especially early on, they would collaborate extensively when writing songs, working \"eyeball to eyeball\" as Lennon phrased.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=137}} Later, it was more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other. By an agreement made before the Beatles became famous, Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted.\n\nLennon\u2013McCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous [[cover version]]s.

Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon\u2013McCartney lyrics have the words \"you\" and/or \"your\" in the first line.{{sfn|Rowley|2008|p=3}} In Lennon's 1980 [[Playboy Interview|''Playboy'' interview]], he said of the partnership:\n{{quote|[Paul] provided a lightness, an optimism, while I would always go for the sadness, the discords, the bluesy notes. There was a period when I thought I didn't write melodies, that Paul wrote those and I just wrote straight, shouting rock 'n' roll. But, of course, when I think of some of my own songs\u2014\"[[In My Life]]\", or some of the early stuff, \"[[This Boy]]\"\u2014I was writing melody with the best of them.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=136. \"In My Life\" was the main song on which Lennon and McCartney disagreed, see below.}}}}\n\nHistorian [[Todd Compton]] has noted that there is some truth to Lennon's statement regarding McCartney's optimism. However, it does not tell the whole story, as some of McCartney's most characteristic songs are tragic, or express themes of isolation, such as \"Yesterday\", \"She's Leaving Home\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" or \"For No One\".{{sfn|Compton|2017|p=382}}\n\nAlthough Lennon and McCartney often wrote independently\u2014and many Beatles songs are primarily the work of one or the other\u2014it was rare that a song would be completed without some input from both writers. In many instances, one writer would sketch an idea or a song fragment and take it to the other to finish or improve; in some cases, two incomplete songs or song ideas that each had worked on individually would be combined into a complete song. Often one of the pair would add a [[middle eight]] or [[bridge (music)|bridge]] section to the other's verse and chorus.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=107}} [[George Martin]] attributed the high quality of their songwriting to the friendly rivalry between the two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Ray |date=1992 |title=Lennon |url= |location=New York, New York |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=363\u2013364 |isbn=0-06-098608-5}}</ref> This approach of the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting team\u2014with elements of competitiveness and mutual inspiration as well as straightforward collaboration and creative merging of musical ideas\u2014is often cited{{by whom|date=April 2016}} as a key reason for the Beatles' innovation and popular success.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs time went on, the songs increasingly became the work of one writer or the other, often with the partner offering up only a few words or an alternative chord. \"[[A Day in the Life]]\" is a notable and well-known example of a later Beatles song that includes substantial contributions by both Lennon and McCartney, where a separate song fragment by McCartney (\"Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head&nbsp;...\") was used to flesh out the middle of Lennon's composition (\"I read the news today, oh boy&nbsp;...\"). \"[[Hey Jude]]\" is another example of a later McCartney song that had input from Lennon: while auditioning the song for Lennon, when McCartney came to the lyric \"the movement you need is on your shoulder\", McCartney assured Lennon that he would change the line\u2014which McCartney felt was nonsensical\u2014as soon as he could come up with a better lyric. Lennon advised McCartney to leave that line alone, saying it was one of the strongest in the song.<ref>''The Beatles Anthology'' documentary</ref>\n\n==Credit variations and disputes==\n===Joint credit===\nWhen McCartney and Lennon met as teenagers and began writing songs together, they agreed that all songs written by them (whether individually or jointly) should be credited to both of them.<ref name=\"salon1\">{{cite web |last=Garcia |first=Gilbert |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/music/feature/2003/01/27/paul_yoko/index.html |title=The ballad of Paul and Yoko |work=salon.com |date=27 January 2003 |accessdate=13 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619034926/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/music/feature/2003/01/27/paul_yoko/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2009  }}</ref> The precise date of the agreement is unknown; however, Lennon spoke in 1980 of an informal agreement between him and McCartney made \"when we were fifteen or sixteen\".{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=214}} Two songs written (primarily by Lennon) in 1957, \"[[Hello Little Girl]]\" and \"[[One After 909]]\", were credited to the partnership when published in the following decade.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=53}} The earliest Beatles recording credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney to be officially released is \"[[You'll Be Mine (Beatles song)|You'll Be Mine]]\", recorded at home in 1960 and included on ''[[Anthology 1]]'' 35 years later.{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nSome other compositions from the band's early years are not credited to the partnership. \"[[In Spite of All the Danger]]\", a 1958 composition that the band (then [[The Quarrymen]]) paid to record to disc, is attributed to McCartney and [[George Harrison]]. \"[[Cayenne (song)|Cayenne]]\", recorded at the same time as \"You'll Be Mine\", is a solo McCartney composition. \"[[Cry for a Shadow]]\", recorded during the Beatles' sessions with [[Tony Sheridan]] in June 1961, was written by Lennon and Harrison.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nBy 1962, the joint credit agreement was in effect. From the time of the Beatles' first [[A&R]] audition in January that year, until Lennon's announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the band, virtually all songs by McCartney or Lennon were published with joint credit. The only exceptions were a handful of the McCartney compositions released by other musicians (viz. \"[[Woman (Paul McCartney song)|Woman]]\" by [[Peter and Gordon]] in 1966, \"Cat Call\" by [[Chris Barber]] in 1967, and \"Penina\" by Carlos Mendes in 1969).{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter the partnership had ended, Lennon and McCartney each gave multiple accounts of their individual contribution to each jointly credited song, and sometimes claimed full authorship.

It is the best known and most successful musical collaboration ever by records sold, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records worldwide as of 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/04/news/companies/beatles_video_game/|title=Beatles' remastered box set, video game out|date=9 September 2009|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> Between 5 October 1962 and 8 May 1970, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue.\n\nUnlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise separate lyricist and composer, such as [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Hal David]] and [[Burt Bacharach]] or [[Elton John]] and [[Bernie Taupin]], both Lennon and McCartney wrote lyrics and music. Sometimes, especially early on, they would collaborate extensively when writing songs, working \"eyeball to eyeball\" as Lennon phrased.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=137}} Later, it was more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other. By an agreement made before the Beatles became famous, Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted.\n\nLennon\u2013McCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous [[cover version]]s. According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" has been recorded by more musicians than any other song.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50867 |title=Most Recorded Song |accessdate=12 May 2009 |work=[[Guinness World Records]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910071729/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50867 |archivedate = 10 September 2006}}</ref>[[File:1964-Lennon-McCartney (cropped).jpg|thumb|Paul McCartney (left) and John Lennon (right) in 1964|alt=|right]]\n==Meeting==\nThe pair met on 6 July 1957, at a local church f\u00eate, where Lennon was playing with his [[skiffle]] group [[the Quarrymen]]. McCartney, brought along by a mutual friend, [[Ivan Vaughan]], impressed Lennon with his ability on the guitar and his version of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\". Soon afterward, Lennon asked McCartney if he would join the Quarrymen. McCartney accepted.<ref>Burlingame, Jeff. John Lennon \"Imagine.\" Berkeley Heights: Enslow Publishers, 2011.

Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all Lennon\u2013McCartney lyrics have the words \"you\" and/or \"your\" in the first line.{{sfn|Rowley|2008|p=3}} In Lennon's 1980 [[Playboy Interview|''Playboy'' interview]], he said of the partnership:\n{{quote|[Paul] provided a lightness, an optimism, while I would always go for the sadness, the discords, the bluesy notes. There was a period when I thought I didn't write melodies, that Paul wrote those and I just wrote straight, shouting rock 'n' roll. But, of course, when I think of some of my own songs\u2014\"[[In My Life]]\", or some of the early stuff, \"[[This Boy]]\"\u2014I was writing melody with the best of them.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=136. \"In My Life\" was the main song on which Lennon and McCartney disagreed, see below.}}}}\n\nHistorian [[Todd Compton]] has noted that there is some truth to Lennon's statement regarding McCartney's optimism.

In many instances, one writer would sketch an idea or a song fragment and take it to the other to finish or improve; in some cases, two incomplete songs or song ideas that each had worked on individually would be combined into a complete song. Often one of the pair would add a [[middle eight]] or [[bridge (music)|bridge]] section to the other's verse and chorus.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=107}} [[George Martin]] attributed the high quality of their songwriting to the friendly rivalry between the two.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Ray |date=1992 |title=Lennon |url= |location=New York, New York |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=363\u2013364 |isbn=0-06-098608-5}}</ref> This approach of the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting team\u2014with elements of competitiveness and mutual inspiration as well as straightforward collaboration and creative merging of musical ideas\u2014is often cited{{by whom|date=April 2016}} as a key reason for the Beatles' innovation and popular success.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs time went on, the songs increasingly became the work of one writer or the other, often with the partner offering up only a few words or an alternative chord. \"[[A Day in the Life]]\" is a notable and well-known example of a later Beatles song that includes substantial contributions by both Lennon and McCartney, where a separate song fragment by McCartney (\"Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head&nbsp;...\") was used to flesh out the middle of Lennon's composition (\"I read the news today, oh boy&nbsp;...\"). \"[[Hey Jude]]\" is another example of a later McCartney song that had input from Lennon: while auditioning the song for Lennon, when McCartney came to the lyric \"the movement you need is on your shoulder\", McCartney assured Lennon that he would change the line\u2014which McCartney felt was nonsensical\u2014as soon as he could come up with a better lyric.

The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020. {{As of|2020|04|05}}, seven additional cases have been confirmed, one each in Kathmandu and Kanchanpur districts, two in Baglung and three in Kailai. Seven of the eight active cases involve people who had recently reutrned from abroad; the first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in a 34-year-old woman from Kailali. A country-wide lockdown came into effect on 24 March, and is scheduled to end on 15 April.\n\nNepal established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India, starting in mid-January. Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''.

For example, ''pseudogout'' refers to the acute symptoms of joint inflammation or [[synovitis]]: red, tender, and swollen joints that may resemble [[gout]]y arthritis (a similar condition in which monosodium [[urate]] crystals are deposited within the joints). [[Chondrocalcinosis]],<ref name=\"emedicine1\">Rothschild, Bruce M {{eMedicine2|radio|125|Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease (radiology)}}</ref><ref name=\"emedicine2\"/> on the other hand, refers to the radiographic evidence of calcification in [[hyaline]] and/or [[fibrocartilage]]. \"Osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD\" reflects a situation where [[osteoarthritis]]  features are the most apparent.
