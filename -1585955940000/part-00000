It is the fourth main entry in the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the sixth on home consoles and the seventh overall. The game was launched in North America in October 2008 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox 360]] consoles, and a month later for Europe and Australia. A version of ''World Tour'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple [[Macintosh]] was later released.<ref name=\"pcver-bigdown\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/03/24/gdc-2009-guitar-hero-world-tour-officially-coming-to-the-pc/|title=GDC 2009: Guitar Hero World Tour officially coming to the PC|last=Callaham|first=John |date=March 24, 2009|publisher=Big Download|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref><ref name=\"pcmac announce\">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57834 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour Coming to PC, Mac | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date = 2009-03-25 | accessdate = 2009-03-25 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/966/966224p1.html |title = GDC 09: Guitar Hero World Tour Hands-on  |website = IGN | first = Nate | last = Ahearn | date = 2009-03-25 | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhile the game continues to feature the use of a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of [[rock music]], ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' is the first game in the ''Guitar Hero'' series to feature drum and microphone controllers for percussion and vocal parts, similar in manner to the competing ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of games. The game allows users to create new songs through the \"Music Studio\" mode, which can then be uploaded and shared through a service known as \"GHTunes\".\n\n''World Tour'' received generally positive reviews with critics responding positively to the quality of the instrument controllers, the customization abilities, and improvements in the game's difficulty compared with the previous ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Guitar Hero#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series}}\n''Guitar Hero World Tour'' builds on the gameplay from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games, in which players attempt to simulate the playing of [[rock music]] using special [[guitar]]-shaped [[game controllers|controllers]]. ''World Tour'' expands beyond the core guitar-based gameplay by introducing the ability to play drums and sing vocals, and supports the ability for up to four players to play together in a virtual band through these different instruments.  Successfully hitting notes increases the player's or band's score, as well as increase the \"Rock Meter\" that represents the song's performance.  Missed notes are not scored and negatively affect the Rock Meter.  If the Rock Meter drops too low, the song ends prematurely, with the virtual audience booing the band off stage.   Completing a consecutive series of notes successfully will increase a scoring multiplier for that player up to 4x. This multiplier is doubled when the player activates star power. Similar to ''[[Rock Band]]'', the band shares a common score, scoring multiplier and band performance meter while each player has their own performance metric; the band also shares the same \"Star Power\" meter, though any player may activate it at any time.  A player that performs poorly and reduces their performance meter to zero can still continue to play, but they drain the overall performance meter for the band, requiring the other players to make up for this.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3169954&p= | title = Guitar Hero World Tour (PS3) | first = Tom | last = Chick | date = 2008-09-16 | accessdate = 2008-09-17 | website = [[1UP.com|1UP]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605040822/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3169954&p= | archivedate = 2011-06-05 }}</ref>  Successfully completing a song garners a three to five-star rating based on the accumulated score, and rewards such as in-game money that can be used to buy new guitars and outfits for characters.\n\nThe guitar interface remains relatively unchanged in ''World Tour''.  As with previous ''Guitar Hero'' titles, the guitar and bass player must hold down the correct fret button(s) on the controller while strumming in time with the notes as they scroll on-screen. One addition to the guitar gameplay is the ability to play notes while holding a sustained note.  Additionally, the bass guitar player is required to play notes representing an [[open string (music)|open E string]], which is shown on-screen as a solid line across their note track.  To play these notes, the bass guitar player strums the controller without pressing any fret button keys.<ref name=\"ign preview\">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/882/882888p1.html | title = Guitar Hero: World Tour First Look | date = 2008-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-06-19 | website = [[IGN]] | first = Erik | last = Brudvig }}</ref> The drum interface is similar to the guitar's interface, with each on-screen note track equivalent to a colored drum head on the controller, with the bass drum indicated by a line across the note track.  The drum player only needs to hit the correct drum pads simultaneously to the note gems to successfully play their track. There are also marked sections indicating [[fill (music)|drum fills]] wherein the player may play any notes they wish in a 'solo' to gain points. The vocal track requires the player to match the pitch of the notes in a manner similar to ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' to be successful. Special sections of each player's note track are marked with glowing notes, which, if completed successfully, builds up Star Power. Once enough Star Power is accumulated, it can be released via various means to double the band's current score multiplier. For guitar and bass, this is done by lifting the guitar controller vertically or (though not in bass) by pressing a button on the guitar face; for drums, by striking both cymbal pads on the controller at the same time; for vocals, by tapping the microphone or making a similarly quick sound.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/> Star Power's use has been modified over previous ''Guitar Hero'' entries in that Star Power can now be accumulated even when Star Power is in use by successfully completing additional Star Power phrases, which extends the Star Power's duration.\n\nIn addition to the standard four [[difficulty level]]s (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in ''World Tour''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/guitarheroiv/news.html?sid=6192790&om_act=convert&om_clk=newlyadded&tag=newlyadded%3Btitle%3B1&page=1 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour first look | website = [[GameSpot]] | first = Shaun | last = McInnis | date = 2008-06-20 | accessdate = 2008-12-06}}</ref> This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with [[bass drum]] beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1396634#1396634 | title = Beginner?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://cnn.hu/2008/TECH/ptech/10/21/guitar.hero/index.html | title =  Newest 'Guitar Hero' lets you create music | publisher = [[CNN]] | first = Brandon | last = Griggs | date = 2008-10-21 | accessdate = 2008-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary [[single-player]] game mode is Career mode, which can be played on the lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, or vocals. Career mode has been slightly altered from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games.  After creating a band, selecting or creating an avatar, and then selecting an instrument, the player is then presented with one of several gigs containing two to five songs each. Most gigs end with an encore song that is not revealed until the other songs are completed. Two of the lead guitar gigs feature \"boss challenges\" with [[Zakk Wylde]] and [[Ted Nugent]]; these boss challenges, featuring original songs by Wylde and Nugent, are different from ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''{{'}}s boss battle, removing the focus on attack [[power-up]]s and instead featuring a call-and-response mechanic similar to the existing Face-Off mode.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The gigs are arranged by difficulty based on the selected instrument. The player is awarded in-game money for each song completed, and completing each gig can also award additional money for meeting certain criteria, such as never letting the Rock Meter drop below a certain level or playing the first several notes of a song perfectly.  Completing a gig can also unlock one or more gigs with more difficult songs to complete.  Additional awards, such as customization items, are also awarded for completing gigs.  The player's accumulated earnings across any of the single player Career Modes are tracked and used to rank the player's overall performance level.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/>\n\n[[Image:Guitar-hero-world-tour-20080715103139463.PNG|right|225px|thumb|Gameplay of a whole band playing Billy Idol's \"Rebel Yell\". On top is vocalist, bottom from left to right: Guitar, Drums, Bass]]\nBand Career mode is similar to the solo Career mode, with the game songs presented as several gigs to be completed.  A band must have at least two players to proceed. The second player may be either a local player or one over the network.  Players may be at different levels of progression in the game, but still gain benefits for successfully completing songs when playing together.  The in-game interface features vocals along the top of the screen, and three tracks underneath, for bass, drums, and guitar; only tracks for active players are shown.  Full four-player bands can compete with other bands online in a Battle of the Bands mode.<ref name=\"1up preview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167919 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730065213/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167919 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-07-30 | title = New Details on Guitar Hero World Tour | website = [[1UP.com]] | first = Kris | last = Pigna | date = 2008-05-21 | accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}</ref>\n\nBoth single players and bands can play a setlist of up to six songs in Quickplay mode, still earning in-game money rewards for their performances. Existing competitive modes from the series, including the Battle Mode from ''Guitar Hero III'', are also present in the game.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/>\n\nThe [[Wii]] version of the game features a special \"Mii Freestyle\" mode that allows players to use their [[Mii]]s as their characters as they improvise songs via the guitar and drum controllers or using the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/900/900365p1.html | title = Guitar Hero World Tour Does Miis | date = 2008-08-20 | accessdate = 2008-08-20 | website = [[IGN]] | first = Matt | last = Casamassina }}</ref>\n\n===Characters and customization===\n[[Image:Ghwt guitar custom.jpg|left|thumb|Players are able to alter aspects or characters or customize their own character within ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.]]\nPlayers are able to use the Create-a-Rocker mode which is based on the Create-a-Skater mode in Neversoft's [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series]] and the advanced [[character creation]] scheme from the ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' series. Players can change their character's poise, clothing, tattoos, makeup, and age. Selected characters from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games are available as templates for creating a rocker.  Previous games featured [[Gibson Guitars]], but as a result of a lawsuit with Gibson Guitars, branded guitars are not featured; instead, the player can create a customized guitar from various components, such as bodies, fretboards, and headstocks. The player's in-game drum set and microphone can also be similarly customized.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The 14 starting characters of the game can be customized too; however, their customization is limited to clothing and accessories only. Activision had formed partnerships with several instrument equipment manufactures to be featured in the game, including Ampeg, Audio-Technica, EMG Pickups, Ernie Ball, [[Evans Drumheads]], Guitar Center, Krank Amplification, Mackie, Marshall, Orange County Drum & Percussion, Pork Pie Percussion, Regal Tip, Sabian, Vox and Zildjian.<ref name=\"branding\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/29651/MI-brands-get-behind-Guitar-Hero-World-Tour | title = MI brands get behind Guitar Hero World Tour | first = Rob | last = Hughes | date = 2008-08-27 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 | publisher = Musical Instrument Professional | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045252/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/29651/MI-brands-get-behind-Guitar-Hero-World-Tour | archive-date = 2008-08-30 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the computer- and player-controlled characters, avatars of notable musicians are featured in the game, either with [[motion capture]] or the licensing of their image for their character.

The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/>  The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for ''Guitar Hero III'', but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons.  The player can use either the fret buttons or the touch pad to play regular notes.  The pad also allows the player to play notes via [[tapping]] or via \"tap strumming\" similar to the [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes.<ref name=\"ign preview\" /><ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called \"Slider Gems\"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments.<ref name=\"ign preview\" /><ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>\n\n====Drums====\n[[Image:Guitar Hero World Tour drums.jpg|left|150px|thumb|PS3 version of the ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' drum kit]]\n''World Tour'' features a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a [[bass drum]] pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the \"most realistic drum experience ever in a video game\".<ref name=\"ign preview\"/><ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Game Informer]] | date = June 2008 | pages = 48\u201357 | title = Guitar Hero 4: Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Meets merge Reality}}</ref><ref name=\"1up preview\"/><ref name=\"gt drum preview\"/><ref name=\"gh4drums\">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/14/game-informer-snags-first-pic-of-guitar-hero-iv-drums/ | title = Game Informer Snags First Pic of Guitar Hero IV Drums | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | date = 2008-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 | first = Justin | last = McElroy }}</ref> Generally, the pads represent the [[snare drum]] (red), the [[tom-tom drum]] (blue), the [[floor tom]] (green), the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat cymbal]] (yellow), and the [[crash cymbal]] (orange), however, they can be used for other percussion instruments depending on the song.

This work was later folded into the ''Guitar Hero'' series after Neversoft was chosen as developer of the series.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> Neversoft's Allen Flores stated that with the addition of the existing drum gameplay, the development of ''World Tour'' took under a year, starting development immediately after the release of ''Guitar Hero III''.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\">{{cite web | url = http://interviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/2304/Neversofts-Alan-Flores-Interview/p1/ | title = Neversoft\u2019s Alan Flores Interview | date = 2008-09-17 | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | publisher = Team Xbox | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919034324/http://interviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/2304/Neversofts-Alan-Flores-Interview/p1/ | archivedate = 2008-09-19 }}</ref> The drum instrument controller was designed to be more realistic, with input from Chad Smith (of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), Stewart Copeland (of [[The Police]]) and Travis Barker (of [[Blink-182]]), all of whom requested the elevated cymbal pads.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/> The ability to open-strum the guitar was a feature that was planned for ''Guitar Hero III'' but was removed before release, finding that it was too difficult on the guitar tracks.  However, they built this feature in from the start of ''World Tour'' development for the bass guitar tracks.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>\n\nBright describes the development of the note track for a given song once it has been licensed for the game as a parallel effort, a process that they have found to be more efficient than their previous work on the ''Tony Hawk'' games.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> Once the song was mixed for use by the development team, a \"tempo map\" was created by one developer; this map denotes the beats in the music which then can be used by the rest of the development team. Once the tempo map was complete, the song was then distributed to the various teams, such as the specific instrument teams or to the animators, to complete the song.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> Note-for-note tracking from the song was then performed, and in some cases, changes were made to account for sections that cannot be replicated on the game controllers; the final track represented the note track for the Expert difficulty of the song.  Note tracks were then reduced and adjusted to create the note tracks for the lower difficulties in the game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> A difficulty assessment was made using the final note tracks to determine where the songs were to be placed in the soundtrack progression.  The difficulty model is based on that from ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', which was adjusted from the ''Guitar Hero III'' model after the team received negative feedback from players regarding a \"brick wall\" in the difficulty progression in that game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>\n\nThe song list for ''World Tour'' started as the list of songs that Neversoft wanted to include in ''Guitar Hero III'', but had failed to get into the game or as downloadable content; the list was eventually expanded to over 500 songs.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  The song list was then prioritized based on what the team thought would be best in the game, and then going after the music that would take the longest time to license, as was the case for the [[Jimi Hendrix]] songs.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  While songs were selected to make sure that guitar, bass, and drums all had great parts, they also opted for songs that would be strong for one single instrument as to make the game still appealing for those playing the single player modes.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>   Some songs were also suggested through the licensing efforts by Activision for inclusion in the game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  Flores stated that the inclusion of caricatures of recording artists in the game was either due to the team seeking that specific artist for the game, or the artist approaching the development team and requesting to be part of it.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/> The band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], which hasn't licensed its music since 1996, allowed for the inclusion of three of its songs in ''World Tour'' as long they were involved with the artwork and tracking of the songs for the game, leading to the creation of the art-like Tool venue.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/10/15/how-tool-came-to-guitar-hero-world-tour-exclusive-video/# | title = How Tool Came to \"Guitar Hero World Tour\": Exclusive Video | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2008-10-15 | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | format = [[Adobe Flash|Flash video]]}}</ref>\n\nBright noted that they had support for \"epic drum solos\", in which the band animation would focus on the drummer, but removed this feature from the game's final release due to its complexity.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  They also had to remove the \"Jam Over\" mode planned for the game's music creation section that would have allowed players to start with one of the game's songs and play over it on their instruments;

The new touchpad on the guitar controller was found to be imprecise to make it difficult to use during difficult song sections and would sometimes fail to register taps or slides; some of these issues were attributed to initial manufacturing problems.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>  The drum kit has been praised for the ease of setup, the drum pad layout, and the response of the drums,<ref name=\"1up review\"/> though the lack of a means to fix the location of bass drum pedal was seen as a drawback when compared to the ''Rock Band'' drum kit.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nThe music creation feature of the game, while seen as a useful addition to the game, was found to be difficult to use,<ref name=\"1up review\"/> suffered from on-screen lag that could interfere with song creation,<ref

seen as an improvement over the limitations of ''Rock Band''.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>  However, reviewers noted that the use of the real-life celebrities against the cartoon-like visuals, along with the emphasis on the band and not individual players, made their presence \"anachronistic\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/>\n\nThe Wii version received additional praise from reviewers, mostly from the changes in the Wii operation to accommodate the game's Music Store and online play features.<ref name=\"ign wii review\">{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/923/923891p1.html | title =

as '''''Guitar Hero IV''''' or '''''Guitar Hero IV: World Tour''''') is a [[Music video game|music]] [[rhythm game]] developed by [[Neversoft]], published by [[Activision]] and distributed by [[RedOctane]]. It is the fourth main entry in the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the sixth on home consoles and the seventh overall. The game was launched in North America in October 2008 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], and [[Xbox 360]] consoles, and a month later for Europe and Australia. A version of ''World Tour'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple [[Macintosh]] was later released.<ref name=\"pcver-bigdown\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/03/24/gdc-2009-guitar-hero-world-tour-officially-coming-to-the-pc/|title=GDC 2009: Guitar Hero World Tour officially coming to the PC|last=Callaham|first=John |date=March 24, 2009|publisher=Big Download|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref><ref name=\"pcmac announce\">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57834 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour Coming to PC, Mac | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date = 2009-03-25 | accessdate = 2009-03-25 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/966/966224p1.html |title = GDC 09: Guitar Hero World Tour Hands-on  |website = IGN | first = Nate | last = Ahearn | date = 2009-03-25 | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWhile the game continues to feature the use of a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of [[rock music]], ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' is the first game in the ''Guitar Hero'' series to feature drum and microphone controllers for percussion and vocal parts, similar in manner to the competing ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of games. The game allows users to create new songs through the \"Music Studio\" mode, which can then be uploaded and shared through a service known as \"GHTunes\".\n\n''World Tour'' received generally positive reviews with critics responding positively to the quality of the instrument controllers, the customization abilities, and improvements in the game's difficulty compared with the previous ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Guitar Hero#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series}}\n''Guitar Hero World Tour'' builds on the gameplay from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games, in which players attempt to simulate the playing of [[rock music]] using special [[guitar]]-shaped [[game controllers|controllers]]. ''World Tour'' expands beyond the core guitar-based gameplay by introducing the ability to play drums and sing vocals, and supports the ability for up to four players to play together in a virtual band through these different instruments.  Successfully hitting notes increases the player's or band's score, as well as increase the \"Rock Meter\" that represents the song's performance.  Missed notes are not scored and negatively affect the Rock Meter.  If the Rock Meter drops too low, the song ends prematurely, with the virtual audience booing the band off stage.   Completing a consecutive series of notes successfully will increase a scoring multiplier for that player up to 4x. This multiplier is doubled when the player activates star power. Similar to ''[[Rock Band]]'', the band shares a common score, scoring multiplier and band performance meter while each player has their own performance metric; the band also shares the same \"Star Power\" meter, though any player may activate it at any time.  A player that performs poorly and reduces their performance meter to zero can still continue to play, but they drain the overall performance meter for the band, requiring the other players to make up for this.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3169954&p= | title = Guitar Hero World Tour (PS3) | first = Tom | last = Chick | date = 2008-09-16 | accessdate = 2008-09-17 | website = [[1UP.com|1UP]] | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605040822/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=0&cId=3169954&p= | archivedate = 2011-06-05 }}</ref>  Successfully completing a song garners a three to five-star rating based on the accumulated score, and rewards such as in-game money that can be used to buy new guitars and outfits for characters.\n\nThe guitar interface remains relatively unchanged in ''World Tour''.  As with previous ''Guitar Hero'' titles, the guitar and bass player must hold down the correct fret button(s) on the controller while strumming in time with the notes as they scroll on-screen. One addition to the guitar gameplay is the ability to play notes while holding a sustained note.  Additionally, the bass guitar player is required to play notes representing an [[open string (music)|open E string]], which is shown on-screen as a solid line across their note track.  To play these notes, the bass guitar player strums the controller without pressing any fret button keys.<ref name=\"ign preview\">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/882/882888p1.html | title = Guitar Hero: World Tour First Look | date = 2008-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-06-19 | website = [[IGN]] | first = Erik | last = Brudvig }}</ref> The drum interface is similar to the guitar's interface, with each on-screen note track equivalent to a colored drum head on the controller, with the bass drum indicated by a line across the note track.  The drum player only needs to hit the correct drum pads simultaneously to the note gems to successfully play their track. There are also marked sections indicating [[fill (music)|drum fills]] wherein the player may play any notes they wish in a 'solo' to gain points. The vocal track requires the player to match the pitch of the notes in a manner similar to ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' to be successful. Special sections of each player's note track are marked with glowing notes, which, if completed successfully, builds up Star Power. Once enough Star Power is accumulated, it can be released via various means to double the band's current score multiplier. For guitar and bass, this is done by lifting the guitar controller vertically or (though not in bass) by pressing a button on the guitar face; for drums, by striking both cymbal pads on the controller at the same time; for vocals, by tapping the microphone or making a similarly quick sound.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/> Star Power's use has been modified over previous ''Guitar Hero'' entries in that Star Power can now be accumulated even when Star Power is in use by successfully completing additional Star Power phrases, which extends the Star Power's duration.\n\nIn addition to the standard four [[difficulty level]]s (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in ''World Tour''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/guitarheroiv/news.html?sid=6192790&om_act=convert&om_clk=newlyadded&tag=newlyadded%3Btitle%3B1&page=1 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour first look | website = [[GameSpot]] | first = Shaun | last = McInnis | date = 2008-06-20 | accessdate = 2008-12-06}}</ref> This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with [[bass drum]] beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1396634#1396634 | title = Beginner?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://cnn.hu/2008/TECH/ptech/10/21/guitar.hero/index.html | title =  Newest 'Guitar Hero' lets you create music | publisher = [[CNN]] | first = Brandon | last = Griggs | date = 2008-10-21 | accessdate = 2008-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Game modes===\nThe primary [[single-player]] game mode is Career mode, which can be played on the lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, or vocals. Career mode has been slightly altered from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games.  After creating a band, selecting or creating an avatar, and then selecting an instrument, the player is then presented with one of several gigs containing two to five songs each. Most gigs end with an encore song that is not revealed until the other songs are completed. Two of the lead guitar gigs feature \"boss challenges\" with [[Zakk Wylde]] and [[Ted Nugent]]; these boss challenges, featuring original songs by Wylde and Nugent, are different from ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''{{'}}s boss battle, removing the focus on attack [[power-up]]s and instead featuring a call-and-response mechanic similar to the existing Face-Off mode.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The gigs are arranged by difficulty based on the selected instrument. The player is awarded in-game money for each song completed, and completing each gig can also award additional money for meeting certain criteria, such as never letting the Rock Meter drop below a certain level or playing the first several notes of a song perfectly.  Completing a gig can also unlock one or more gigs with more difficult songs to complete.  Additional awards, such as customization items, are also awarded for completing gigs.  The player's accumulated earnings across any of the single player Career Modes are tracked and used to rank the player's overall performance level.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/>\n\n[[Image:Guitar-hero-world-tour-20080715103139463.PNG|right|225px|thumb|Gameplay of a whole band playing Billy Idol's \"Rebel Yell\". On top is vocalist, bottom from left to right: Guitar, Drums, Bass]]\nBand Career mode is similar to the solo Career mode, with the game songs presented as several gigs to be completed.  A band must have at least two players to proceed. The second player may be either a local player or one over the network.  Players may be at different levels of progression in the game, but still gain benefits for successfully completing songs when playing together.  The in-game interface features vocals along the top of the screen, and three tracks underneath, for bass, drums, and guitar; only tracks for active players are shown.  Full four-player bands can compete with other bands online in a Battle of the Bands mode.<ref name=\"1up preview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167919 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730065213/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3167919 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-07-30 | title = New Details on Guitar Hero World Tour | website = [[1UP.com]] | first = Kris | last = Pigna | date = 2008-05-21 | accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}</ref>\n\nBoth single players and bands can play a setlist of up to six songs in Quickplay mode, still earning in-game money rewards for their performances. Existing competitive modes from the series, including the Battle Mode from ''Guitar Hero III'', are also present in the game.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/>\n\nThe [[Wii]] version of the game features a special \"Mii Freestyle\" mode that allows players to use their [[Mii]]s as their characters as they improvise songs via the guitar and drum controllers or using the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/900/900365p1.html | title = Guitar Hero World Tour Does Miis | date = 2008-08-20 | accessdate = 2008-08-20 | website = [[IGN]] | first = Matt | last = Casamassina }}</ref>\n\n===Characters and customization===\n[[Image:Ghwt guitar custom.jpg|left|thumb|Players are able to alter aspects or characters or customize their own character within ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.]]\nPlayers are able to use the Create-a-Rocker mode which is based on the Create-a-Skater mode in Neversoft's [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series]] and the advanced [[character creation]] scheme from the ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' series. Players can change their character's poise, clothing, tattoos, makeup, and age. Selected characters from previous ''Guitar Hero'' games are available as templates for creating a rocker.  Previous games featured [[Gibson Guitars]], but as a result of a lawsuit with Gibson Guitars, branded guitars are not featured; instead, the player can create a customized guitar from various components, such as bodies, fretboards, and headstocks. The player's in-game drum set and microphone can also be similarly customized.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The 14 starting characters of the game can be customized too; however, their customization is limited to clothing and accessories only. Activision had formed partnerships with several instrument equipment manufactures to be featured in the game, including Ampeg, Audio-Technica, EMG Pickups, Ernie Ball, [[Evans Drumheads]], Guitar Center, Krank Amplification, Mackie, Marshall, Orange County Drum & Percussion, Pork Pie Percussion, Regal Tip, Sabian, Vox and Zildjian.<ref name=\"branding\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/29651/MI-brands-get-behind-Guitar-Hero-World-Tour | title = MI brands get behind Guitar Hero World Tour | first = Rob | last = Hughes | date = 2008-08-27 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 | publisher = Musical Instrument Professional | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045252/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/29651/MI-brands-get-behind-Guitar-Hero-World-Tour | archive-date = 2008-08-30 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the computer- and player-controlled characters, avatars of notable musicians are featured in the game, either with [[motion capture]] or the licensing of their image for their character.

The unit is approximately 25% larger than previous controllers, making it closer to the size of a real guitar.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  The new controller includes a longer [[whammy bar]] and places the Star Power button directly below the strum bar, improving the access of these features.  The strum bar itself was made quieter and longer.<ref name=\"ign preview\"/>  The neck of the guitar is detachable, similar to the Gibson Les Paul controller for ''Guitar Hero III'', but the connector has been hardened to avoid connection issues experienced with the previous unit.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  The neck of the guitar features a touch-sensitive pad just toward the body end from the normal five fret buttons.  The player can use either the fret buttons or the touch pad to play regular notes.  The pad also allows the player to play notes via [[tapping]] or via \"tap strumming\" similar to the [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] method for bass guitar, and to alter the pitch of sustained notes.<ref name=\"ign preview\" /><ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  Guitar tracks feature notes connected by a semi-transparent purple line, (except for the Wii and PlayStation 2 version, in which semi-transparent gems replace this purple line) called \"Slider Gems\"; the player can play these notes by sliding their fingers up and down the touch pad or by tapping the fret buttons without strumming.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>  The touchpad can also be used for sustained and staccato notes in the music studio feature while recording guitar, and is used for finer control over loops when recording other instruments.<ref name=\"ign preview\" /><ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/>\n\n====Drums====\n[[Image:Guitar Hero World Tour drums.jpg|left|150px|thumb|PS3 version of the ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' drum kit]]\n''World Tour'' features a wireless six-piece drum kit, with a [[bass drum]] pedal and five velocity-sensitive drum pads, which Activision has stated provide the \"most realistic drum experience ever in a video game\".<ref name=\"ign preview\"/><ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Game Informer]] | date = June 2008 | pages = 48\u201357 | title = Guitar Hero 4: Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Meets merge Reality}}</ref><ref name=\"1up preview\"/><ref name=\"gt drum preview\"/><ref name=\"gh4drums\">{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/14/game-informer-snags-first-pic-of-guitar-hero-iv-drums/ | title = Game Informer Snags First Pic of Guitar Hero IV Drums | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | date = 2008-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 | first = Justin | last = McElroy }}</ref> Generally, the pads represent the [[snare drum]] (red), the [[tom-tom drum]] (blue), the [[floor tom]] (green), the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat cymbal]] (yellow), and the [[crash cymbal]] (orange), however, they can be used for other percussion instruments depending on the song. The bass drum is represented by a purple, horizontal line on the highway, which players must use the drum pedal to hit. The drum kit was designed with help from John Devacka, the developer of  ''[[MTV Drumscape]]'', and developed key patents used for most modern [[music game]]s that are now owned by Activision.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/>  Special note gems on the drum track, representing [[accent (music)|accent notes]], are \"armored\", requiring the player to strike the corresponding drum head harder in order to break the armor and score more points.

For other consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a headset can also be used as an alternative, but has proven to be less reliable as it tends not to pick up the audio from the player.

This work was later folded into the ''Guitar Hero'' series after Neversoft was chosen as developer of the series.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> Neversoft's Allen Flores stated that with the addition of the existing drum gameplay, the development of ''World Tour'' took under a year, starting development immediately after the release of ''Guitar Hero III''.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\">{{cite web | url = http://interviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/2304/Neversofts-Alan-Flores-Interview/p1/ | title = Neversoft\u2019s Alan Flores Interview | date = 2008-09-17 | accessdate = 2008-09-20 | publisher = Team Xbox | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919034324/http://interviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/2304/Neversofts-Alan-Flores-Interview/p1/ | archivedate = 2008-09-19 }}</ref> The drum instrument controller was designed to be more realistic, with input from Chad Smith (of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), Stewart Copeland (of [[The Police]]) and Travis Barker (of [[Blink-182]]), all of whom requested the elevated cymbal pads.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/> The ability to open-strum the guitar was a feature that was planned for ''Guitar Hero III'' but was removed before release, finding that it was too difficult on the guitar tracks.  However, they built this feature in from the start of ''World Tour'' development for the bass guitar tracks.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>\n\nBright describes the development of the note track for a given song once it has been licensed for the game as a parallel effort, a process that they have found to be more efficient than their previous work on the ''Tony Hawk'' games.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> Once the song was mixed for use by the development team, a \"tempo map\" was created by one developer; this map denotes the beats in the music which then can be used by the rest of the development team. Once the tempo map was complete, the song was then distributed to the various teams, such as the specific instrument teams or to the animators, to complete the song.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> Note-for-note tracking from the song was then performed, and in some cases, changes were made to account for sections that cannot be replicated on the game controllers; the final track represented the note track for the Expert difficulty of the song.  Note tracks were then reduced and adjusted to create the note tracks for the lower difficulties in the game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/> A difficulty assessment was made using the final note tracks to determine where the songs were to be placed in the soundtrack progression.  The difficulty model is based on that from ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', which was adjusted from the ''Guitar Hero III'' model after the team received negative feedback from players regarding a \"brick wall\" in the difficulty progression in that game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>\n\nThe song list for ''World Tour'' started as the list of songs that Neversoft wanted to include in ''Guitar Hero III'', but had failed to get into the game or as downloadable content; the list was eventually expanded to over 500 songs.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  The song list was then prioritized based on what the team thought would be best in the game, and then going after the music that would take the longest time to license, as was the case for the [[Jimi Hendrix]] songs.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  While songs were selected to make sure that guitar, bass, and drums all had great parts, they also opted for songs that would be strong for one single instrument as to make the game still appealing for those playing the single player modes.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>   Some songs were also suggested through the licensing efforts by Activision for inclusion in the game.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  Flores stated that the inclusion of caricatures of recording artists in the game was either due to the team seeking that specific artist for the game, or the artist approaching the development team and requesting to be part of it.<ref name=\"teamxbox flores interview\"/> The band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], which hasn't licensed its music since 1996, allowed for the inclusion of three of its songs in ''World Tour'' as long they were involved with the artwork and tracking of the songs for the game, leading to the creation of the art-like Tool venue.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/10/15/how-tool-came-to-guitar-hero-world-tour-exclusive-video/# | title = How Tool Came to \"Guitar Hero World Tour\": Exclusive Video | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 2008-10-15 | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | format = [[Adobe Flash|Flash video]]}}</ref>\n\nBright noted that they had support for \"epic drum solos\", in which the band animation would focus on the drummer, but removed this feature from the game's final release due to its complexity.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>  They also had to remove the \"Jam Over\" mode planned for the game's music creation section that would have allowed players to start with one of the game's songs and play over it on their instruments; this feature was removed in order to keep the final product polished and on-time.<ref name=\"1up bright interview\"/>\n\nThe custom song creation feature was inspired by the current \"hacking environment\" that has arisen from the first two ''Guitar Hero'' games, where players would create new tracks and share them with others.<ref name=\"1up preview\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=141770 | title = Neversoft talks World Tour | date = 2008-05-21 | accessdate= 2008-05-21 | first = Johnny | last = Minkley | website = [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Hands-On Mobile]] has secured the worldwide rights to create a mobile phone version of the game to be released later in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Guitar+Hero:+World+Tour/news.asp?c=8837 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour coming to mobile phones | publisher = Pocket Gamer | first = Stuart | last = Dredge | date = 2008-09-10 | accessdate = 2008-09-10 }}</ref>  A version of the game has been rated by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] computers, though Activision has not officially confirmed this version.<ref name=\"ghwt pc release\">{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53952 | title = Guitar Hero World Tour PC Edition Listed by ESRB;

However, critics found that the setlist contains very few standout hits, and that the inclusion of a number of foreign-language and difficult-to-recognize songs weakened the overall list.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/><ref name=\"gamespy review\"/>  Reviews also commented on the number of songs that overlapped with ''Rock Band 2''{{'}}s set list.<ref name=\"gamespy review\"/>\n\nReviews of the instrument peripherals for ''World Tour'' were mixed.  The new touchpad on the guitar controller was found to be imprecise to make it difficult to use during difficult song sections and would sometimes fail to register taps or slides; some of these issues were attributed to initial manufacturing problems.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>  The drum kit has been praised for the ease of setup, the drum pad layout, and the response of the drums,<ref name=\"1up review\"/> though the lack of a means to fix the location of bass drum pedal was seen as a drawback when compared to the ''Rock Band'' drum kit.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>\n\nThe music creation feature of the game, while seen as a useful addition to the game, was found to be difficult to use,<ref name=\"1up review\"/> suffered from on-screen lag that could interfere with song creation,<ref name=\"ign review\"/> and the quality of the resulting songs were compared to [[ring tones]] for cell phones.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>  The character customization in ''World Tour'' was generally seen as an improvement over the limitations of ''Rock Band''.<ref name=\"ign review\"/>  However, reviewers noted that the use of the real-life celebrities against the cartoon-like visuals, along with the emphasis on the band and not individual players, made their presence \"anachronistic\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/>\n\nThe Wii version received additional praise from reviewers, mostly from the changes in the Wii operation to accommodate the game's Music Store and online play features.<ref name=\"ign wii review\">{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/923/923891p1.html | title =

Conversely, the diminished sixth is severely dissonant and seems to howl like a wolf, because of a phenomenon called [[Beat (acoustics)|beating]]. Since the diminished sixth is meant to be [[enharmonically equivalent]] to a perfect fifth, this anomalous interval has come to be called the wolf fifth.\n\nBesides the above-mentioned quarter comma meantone, other tuning systems may produce severely dissonant diminished sixths. Conversely, in [[12-tone equal temperament#Twelve-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal temperament]], which is currently the most commonly used tuning system, the diminished sixth is not a wolf fifth, as it has exactly the same size as a perfect fifth.\n\nBy extension, any interval which is perceived as severely dissonant and may be regarded as howling like a wolf may be called a '''wolf interval'''. For instance, in quarter comma meantone, the [[augmented second]], [[augmented third]], [[augmented fifth]], [[diminished fourth]] and [[diminished seventh]] may be considered wolf intervals, as their size significantly deviates from the size of the corresponding [[Just intonation|justly tuned]] interval (see [[Quarter comma meantone#Size of intervals|Size of quarter-comma meantone intervals]]).\n\n{{Listen|filename=Mean5th Wolf 5th.ogg|title=Meantone and wolf fifths|description=A mean fifth followed by a wolf fifth in [[quarter-comma meantone]] temperament|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Temperament and the wolf ==\n\nIn 12-tone scales, the average value of the twelve fifths must equal the 700 [[Cent (music)|cents]] of [[equal temperament]]. If eleven of them have a value of 700&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b5'' cents, as in [[quarter-comma meantone]] and most other [[meantone temperament]] tuning systems, the other fifth (more properly called a diminished sixth) will equal 700&nbsp;+&nbsp;11''\u03b5'' cents. The value of ''\u03b5'' changes depending on the tuning system. In other tuning systems (such as [[Pythagorean tuning]] and twelfth-comma meantone), eleven fifths may have a size of 700&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b5'' cents, thus the diminished sixth is 700&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;11''\u03b5'' cents. If 11''\u03b5'' is very large, as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system, the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth.\n\nIn terms of [[frequency]] [[ratio]]s, the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the fifths must be 128, and if ''f'' is the size of a fifth, 128:''f''<sup>11</sup>, or ''f''<sup>11</sup>:128, will be the size of the wolf.\n\nWe likewise find varied tunings for the thirds. [[Major third]]s must average 400 cents, and to each pair of thirds of size 400&nbsp;\u2213&nbsp;4''\u03b5'' cents we have a third (or diminished fourth) of 400&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;8''\u03b5'' cents, leading to eight thirds 4''\u03b5'' cents narrower or wider, and four diminished fourths 8''\u03b5'' cents wider or narrower than average. Three of these diminished fourths form major [[triad (music)|triad]]s with perfect fifths, but one of them forms a major triad with the diminished sixth. If the diminished sixth is a wolf interval, this triad is called the '''wolf major triad'''.\n\nSimilarly, we obtain nine [[minor third]]s of 300&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;3''\u03b5'' cents and three minor thirds (or augmented seconds) of 300&nbsp;\u2213&nbsp;9''\u03b5'' cents.\n\n=== Quarter comma meantone ===\nIn [[quarter-comma meantone]], the fifth is of size {{radic|5|4}}, about 3.42157 cents (or exactly one twelfth of a [[diesis]]) flatter than 700 cents, and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents, or 35.682 cents sharper than a [[perfect fifth]] of size exactly 3:2, and this is the original howling wolf fifth.\n\nThe flat minor thirds are only about 2.335 cents sharper than a [[Septimal minor third|subminor third]] of size 7:6, and the sharp major thirds, of size exactly 32:25, are about 7.712 cents flatter than the [[Septimal major third|supermajor third]] of 9:7. Meantone tunings with slightly flatter fifths produce even closer approximations to the subminor and supermajor thirds and corresponding triads. These thirds therefore hardly deserve the appellation of wolf, and in fact historically have not been given that name.\n\n=== Pythagorean tuning ===\nIn [[Pythagorean tuning]], there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents (or exactly one twelfth of a [[Pythagorean comma]]), and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that, which is 23.460 cents (one Pythagorean comma) flatter than a just fifth. A fifth this flat can also be regarded as howling like a wolf. There are also now eight sharp and four flat major thirds.\n\n=== Five-limit tuning ===\n[[Five-limit tuning]] was designed to maximize the number of pure intervals, but even in this system several intervals are markedly impure.  5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to [[Pythagorean tuning]], which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning. Namely, while Pythagorean tuning determines only 2 wolf intervals (a fifth and a fourth), the 5-limit symmetric scales produce 12 of them, and the asymmetric scale 14.  It is also important to note that the two fifths, three minor thirds, and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables (ratio 40/27, 32/27, and 27/16 (or G\u2212, E\u266d\u2212, and A+), even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals, deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount (1 [[syntonic comma]], i.e., 81/80, or about 21.5 cents) large enough to be clearly perceived as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]].\n\n[[Five-limit tuning]] determines one diminished sixth of size 1024:675 (about 722 cents, i.e. 20 cents sharper than the 3:2 Pythagorean perfect fifth). Whether this interval should be considered dissonant enough to be called a wolf fifth is a controversial matter.\n\nFive-limit tuning also creates two ''impure'' perfect fifths of size 40:27 (about 680 cents; less ''pure'' than the 3:2 Pythagorean perfect fifth). These are not diminished sixths, but relative to the Pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant (about 20 cents flatter) and hence, they might be considered to be wolf fifths. The corresponding [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] is an ''impure'' perfect fourth of size 27:20 (about 520 cents). For instance, in the [[major scale|C major]] [[diatonic scale]], an impure perfect fifth arises between D and A, and its inversion arises between A and D.\n\nSince the term ''perfect'' means, in this context, perfectly consonant,<ref>\n[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_20oBAAAAYAAJ <!-- quote=perfect concord. --> Definition of ''Perfect consonance''] in Godfrey Weber's General music teacher, by Godfrey Weber, 1841.</ref> the impure perfect fourth and perfect fifth are sometimes simply called ''imperfect'' fourth and fifth.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> However, the widely adopted standard naming convention for [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]] classifies them as ''perfect'' intervals, together with the [[octave]] and [[unison]]. This is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios (for instance, those tuned using [[12-tone equal temperament|12-tone equal]] or [[quarter-comma meantone]] temperament). Conversely, the expressions ''imperfect fourth'' and ''imperfect fifth'' do not conflict with the standard naming convention when they refer to a dissonant [[augmented third]] or [[diminished sixth]] (e.g. the wolf fourth and fifth in Pythagorean tuning).\n\n== \"Taming the wolf\" ==\nWolf intervals are a consequence of mapping a two-dimensional temperament to a one-dimensional keyboard.<ref name=Milne2007>{{cite journal\n| first1 = Andrew\n| last1 = Milne\n| first2 = William\n| last2 = Sethares\n| author-link2 = William Sethares\n| first3 = James\n| last3 = Plamondon\n|date=December 2007\n| title = Invariant Fingerings Across a Tuning Continuum\n| journal = Computer Music Journal\n| volume = 31\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 15\u201332\n| url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15\n| accessdate = 2013-07-11\n| doi =  10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15}}</ref> The only solution is to make the number of dimensions match.

The very intrepid may simply want to treat it as a [[xenharmonic music]] interval; depending on the size of the meantone fifth it can be made to be exactly 20:13 or 17:11, or less commonly to 32:21 or 49:32.\n\nWith a more extreme meantone temperament, like [[19 equal temperament]], the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth, and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth.\n\n=== Keep the two-dimensional tuning system ===\n[[Image:Isomorphic Note Layout.jpg|thumb|top|550px|Figure 1: The Wicki isomorphic keyboard, invented by Kaspar Wicki in 1896.<ref name=Gaskins2003>{{cite web\n| first1 = Robert\n| last1 = Gaskins\n|date=September 2003\n| title = The Wicki System\u2014an 1896 Precursor of the Hayden System\n| url = http://www.concertina.com/gaskins/wicki/\n| website = Concertina Library: Digital Reference Collection for Concertinas\n| accessdate = 2013-07-11 }}</ref>]]\n[[Image:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Figure 2: The [[syntonic temperament]]\u2019s tuning continuum.<ref name=Milne2007 />]]\nTo use a two-dimensional temperament without wolf intervals, one needs a two-dimensional keyboard that is \"[[isomorphic]]\" with that temperament. A keyboard and temperament are isomorphic if they are generated by the same intervals. For example, the Wicki keyboard shown in Figure 1 is generated by the same musical intervals as the [[syntonic temperament]] \u2014 that is, by the [[octave]] and tempered [[perfect fifth]] \u2014 so they are isomorphic.\n\nOn an [[isomorphic keyboard]], any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears \u2014 in any octave, key, and tuning \u2014 except at the edges. For example, on Wicki's keyboard, from any given note, the note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher is always up-and-rightwardly adjacent to the given note. There are no wolf intervals within the note-span of this keyboard. The only problem is at the edge, on the note E{{music|sharp}}. The note that is a tempered perfect fifth higher than E{{music|sharp}} is B{{music|sharp}}, which is not included on the keyboard shown (although it could be included in a larger keyboard, placed just to the right of A{{music|sharp}}, hence maintaining the keyboard's consistent note-pattern). Because there is no B{{music|sharp}} button, when playing an E{{music|sharp}} [[power chord]], one must choose some other note that is close in pitch to B{{music|sharp}}, such as C, to play instead of the missing B{{music|sharp}}. That is, the interval from E{{music|sharp}} to C would be a \"wolf interval\" on this keyboard.\n\nHowever, such edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has [[enharmonic]]ally distinct notes.<ref name=Milne2007 /> For example, the isomorphic keyboard in Figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave, so the above-cited edge condition, from E{{music|sharp}} to C, is ''not'' a wolf interval in [[Equal temperament|12-TET]], [[17 equal temperament|17-TET]], or [[19 equal temperament|19-TET]]; however, it ''is'' a wolf interval in 26-TET, [[31 equal temperament|31-TET]], and [[53 equal temperament|53-TET]].

The value of ''\u03b5'' changes depending on the tuning system. In other tuning systems (such as [[Pythagorean tuning]] and twelfth-comma meantone), eleven fifths may have a size of 700&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b5'' cents, thus the diminished sixth is 700&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;11''\u03b5'' cents. If 11''\u03b5'' is very large, as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system, the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth.\n\nIn terms of [[frequency]] [[ratio]]s, the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the fifths must be 128, and if ''f'' is the size of a fifth, 128:''f''<sup>11</sup>, or ''f''<sup>11</sup>:128, will be the size of the wolf.\n\nWe likewise find varied tunings for the thirds. [[Major third]]s must average 400 cents, and to each pair of thirds of size 400&nbsp;\u2213&nbsp;4''\u03b5'' cents we have a third (or diminished fourth) of 400&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;8''\u03b5'' cents, leading to eight thirds 4''\u03b5'' cents narrower or wider, and four diminished fourths 8''\u03b5'' cents wider or narrower than average. Three of these diminished fourths form major [[triad (music)|triad]]s with perfect fifths, but one of them forms a major triad with the diminished sixth. If the diminished sixth is a wolf interval, this triad is called the '''wolf major triad'''.\n\nSimilarly, we obtain nine [[minor third]]s of 300&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;3''\u03b5'' cents and three minor thirds (or augmented seconds) of 300&nbsp;\u2213&nbsp;9''\u03b5'' cents.\n\n=== Quarter comma meantone ===\nIn [[quarter-comma meantone]], the fifth is of size {{radic|5|4}}, about 3.42157 cents (or exactly one twelfth of a [[diesis]]) flatter than 700 cents, and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents, or 35.682 cents sharper than a [[perfect fifth]] of size exactly 3:2, and this is the original howling wolf fifth.\n\nThe flat minor thirds are only about 2.335 cents sharper than a [[Septimal minor third|subminor third]] of size 7:6, and the sharp major thirds, of size exactly 32:25, are about 7.712 cents flatter than the [[Septimal major third|supermajor third]] of 9:7. Meantone tunings with slightly flatter fifths produce even closer approximations to the subminor and supermajor thirds and corresponding triads. These thirds therefore hardly deserve the appellation of wolf, and in fact historically have not been given that name.\n\n=== Pythagorean tuning ===\nIn [[Pythagorean tuning]], there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents (or exactly one twelfth of a [[Pythagorean comma]]), and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that, which is 23.460 cents (one Pythagorean comma) flatter than a just fifth. A fifth this flat can also be regarded as howling like a wolf. There are also now eight sharp and four flat major thirds.\n\n=== Five-limit tuning ===\n[[Five-limit tuning]] was designed to maximize the number of pure intervals, but even in this system several intervals are markedly impure.  5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to [[Pythagorean tuning]], which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning. Namely, while Pythagorean tuning determines only 2 wolf intervals (a fifth and a fourth), the 5-limit symmetric scales produce 12 of them, and the asymmetric scale 14.  It is also important to note that the two fifths, three minor thirds, and three major sixths marked in orange in the tables (ratio 40/27, 32/27, and 27/16 (or G\u2212, E\u266d\u2212, and A+), even though they do not completely meet the conditions to be wolf intervals, deviate from the corresponding pure ratio by an amount (1 [[syntonic comma]], i.e., 81/80, or about 21.5 cents) large enough to be clearly perceived as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]].\n\n[[Five-limit tuning]] determines one diminished sixth of size 1024:675 (about 722 cents, i.e. 20 cents sharper than the 3:2 Pythagorean perfect fifth).

These are not diminished sixths, but relative to the Pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant (about 20 cents flatter) and hence, they might be considered to be wolf fifths.

That is, the interval from E{{music|sharp}} to C would be a \"wolf interval\" on this keyboard.\n\nHowever, such edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has [[enharmonic]]ally distinct notes.<ref name=Milne2007 /> For example, the isomorphic keyboard in Figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave, so the above-cited edge condition, from E{{music|sharp}} to C, is ''not'' a wolf interval in [[Equal temperament|12-TET]], [[17 equal temperament|17-TET]], or [[19 equal temperament|19-TET]]; however, it ''is'' a wolf interval in 26-TET, [[31 equal temperament|31-TET]], and [[53 equal temperament|53-TET]]. In these latter tunings, using electronic transposition could keep the current key's notes centered on the isomorphic keyboard, in which case these wolf intervals would very rarely be encountered in tonal music, despite modulation to exotic keys.<ref name=Plamondon2009>{{cite journal\n| first = Jim\n| last = Plamondon\n|author2=Milne, A. |author3=Sethares, W.A. \n| year = 2009\n| title =  Dynamic Tonality: Extending the Framework of Tonality into the 21st Century\n| journal = Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the South Central Chapter of the College Music Society\n| url = http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/paperspdf/CMS2009.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\nA keyboard that is isomorphic with the syntonic temperament, such as Wicki's keyboard above, retains its isomorphism in any tuning within the tuning continuum of the syntonic temperament, even when changing tuning dynamically among such tunings.<ref name=Plamondon2009 /> Figure 2 shows the valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament.\n\n== Listen to it ==\nListen to the two fifths here:\n{{listen |filename=C-g mittelt\u00f6niger Wolf.ogg |title=Meantone Wolf |description=Listen to the wolf fifth }}\n{{listen |filename=C-g_rein.ogg |title=Perfect Fifth|description=Listen to the perfect fifth }}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Intervals|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolf Interval}}\n[[Category:Intervals (music)]]\n", "name_user": "The Nth User", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made the two audio boxes display in the actual Listen to it section instead of to the right of the references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval"}
