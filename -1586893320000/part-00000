[[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] von Faulhaber rejected the [[Weimar Republic]] as rooted in treason<ref>Michael Kardinal von Faulhaber: Rede zum 62. Deutschen Katholikentag, M\u00fcnchen (1922).</ref> and opposed democratic government in general, favoring a Catholic monarchy. Faulhaber  publicly recognized the Nazi government as legitimate, required Catholic clergy to remain loyal to the Nazi government, and maintained bridges between fascism and the Church.<ref>Nazis on the Run, Gerald Steinacher, p. 127; Beth A.

Catholic apologists have sought to portray him as a committed anti-Nazi. Others have highlighted his collusion. In 2017 the ''Bund f\u00fcr Geistesfreiheit M\u00fcnchen'', in an open letter demanding the renaming of the Cardinal-Faulhaber-Strasse, called it unbearable that an antisemite such as Faulhaber should still be honoured with a street name.  In a September 1933 diary entry Faulhaber had written that he hoped Hitler would succeed in doing what Bismarck had failed to do and 'eradicate the evil of the parliamentary democratic system'.  The open letter cited Faulhaber's [[antisemitic]] hatred of [[Kurt Eisner]], his 1936 extension to the Nazi regime the right to 'take action against the excesses of Judaism in his area', his proclamation in 1936 of 'the unanimous commitment of the German bishops to the Fuhrer and his world historical work' and his 1938 call for Catholics 'to make a vow of allegiance to the Fuhrer in the hour of world history'. <ref> bfg bayern  antisemit und hitler [https://bfg-bayern.de/portal/article/antisemit-und-hitler-verehrer-offener-brief-ob-reiter-fordert-umbenennung-der-m\u00fcnchner]</ref>\n\n==Life until after the First World War==\nMichael Faulhaber was born in Klosterheidenfeld, Bavaria, the third of seven children of the baker Michael Faulhaber (1831\u20131900) and his wife Margarete (1839\u20131911). He was educated at [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in [[Schweinfurt]] and W\u00fcrzburg.  In 1887-88 he was a soldier and non-commissioned officer in the Bavarian army.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Faulhaber, Michael}}</ref> In 1889 he entered the Kilianeum (Catholic) Seminary in W\u00fcrzburg and was ordained on 1 August 1892. Faulhaber was a priest in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1892 until 1910, serving there for six years. His studies included a specialisation in the early Christian writer [[Tertullian]]. In 1895 he graduated from his studies with a doctorate in theology. From 1894 to 1896, he was prefect of the Kilianeum Seminary. From 1896 to 1899, he was engaged in studying manuscripts at the Vatican and other Italian museums. From 1899 to 1903, he was [[privatdocent]] in Greek palaeography, Biblical archaeology, homiletics, and exegesis of the Psalms, at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. In 1900 he visited England to study manuscripts of early Christian literature, spending one semester at Oxford. In 1902 he visited Spain for a similar purpose.<ref name=ea/> In 1903 he became professor of theology at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

On 1 March 1913, he was appointed a Knight of the [[Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown]] by [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Prince Regent Ludwig]]; in accordance with the statutes of this order, Faulhaber was ennobled with the style of \"''[[Ritter]] [[von]] Faulhaber''\".  In 1916 he won the [[Iron Cross]] (as the first clergyman in the [[German Empire]]) at the [[Western Front of World War I|Western Front]] for his frontline support of troops by acting as a [[military chaplain]].<ref name=\"Speaking Symbol\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859826,00.html?promoid=googlep Speaking Symbol] 23 June 1952.

At the national Catholic conference (''Katholiikentag'') of 1922 in Munich, he declared that the Weimar Republic was  a  \"''perjury and betrayal''\", because it had arrived through the overthrow of the legitimate civil authorities, the monarchies, and had included in its constitution the separation of church and state. The declaration disturbed Catholics who were committed to the Weimar Republic. Faulhaber had praised the monarchy a few months earlier at the funeral of [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig]].<ref>Robert Krieg, Catholic Theologians and Nazi Germany, p. 25.</ref>\n\nFaulhaber publicised, and supported by creating an institutional link for the association, the work of ''[[Amici Isra\u00ebl]]''. He supported the group by distributing its writings, saying \"we must ensure wide distribution of the writings of the Amici Israel\" and admonishing preachers to steer clear of any statements that \"might sound in any way anti-Semitic\" \u2013 this even though, \"he himself was somewhat tainted by anti-Semitic stereotypes that placed Jews in the same category as Freemasons and Socialists.\"<ref>Hubert Wolf, Pope and Devil: the Vatican's archives and the Third Reich, pp. 89\u201390, Harvard University Press, 31 May 2010.</ref> Faulhaber was friends with the group's promoter, Sophie Francisca van Leer;<ref>Hill, Roland,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxSLvB-mujcC&dq A time out of joint: A journey from Nazi Germany to post-war Britain], The Radcliffe Press, 30 October 2007.</ref> its special aim was to seek changes to the [[Good Friday]] prayer and some of its Latin phrases such as ''pro perfidis Judaeis'' (for treacherous Jews) and ''judaicam perfidiam'' (Jewish treachery) and sought the cessation of the deicide accusation against Jews.

Faulhaber responded in a sermon:\n\"A lunatic abroad has had an attack of madness \u2013 does this justify wholesale suspicion of the German Catholics? You are all witnesses for the fact that on all Sundays and holidays at the main service we pray in all churches for the F\u00fchrer as we have promised in the Concordat.

Discussion of the [[Spanish Civil War]] dominated the proceedings. The German bishops fundamentally accepted the Nazi presentation of the role of Bolsheviks in this war \u2013 Goebbels's propaganda ministry instructed reporters to call the Republicans simply ''the Bolsheviks'', and in a letter the joint episcopacy stated; \"German unity should not be sacrificed to religious antagonism, quarrels, contempt and struggles. Rather our national power of resistance must be increased and strengthened so that not only may Europe be freed from Bolshevism by us, but also that the whole civilized world may be indebted to us.\"  \n\nNuncio Cesare Orsenigo arranged for Faulhaber to have a private meeting with Hitler. On 4 November 1936, Faulhaber travelled to Hitler's mountain retreat near [[Berchtesgaden]]. According to [[Michael Burleigh]]'s account of this meeting, Hitler  dominated the conversation, expressing his disappointment in the Church's response to Nazi actions and dismissing the Reich's attacks on the Church \u2013 the meeting sputtering out in a reciprocal lack of understanding.<ref>Burleigh, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0wFs8uUIQEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Sacred Causes: The Clash of Religion and Politics, from the Great War to the War on Terror], p. 188, HarperCollins, 2008.</ref> Historian Beth Griech-Polelle however, delivers a quite different account in which, following Faulhaber's own account, early tension eased as the meeting progressed and when Hitler had argued his goal was to protect the German people from ''congenitally afflicted criminals such as now wreak havoc in Spain'' Faulhaber had immediately replied: \" The Church, Mr Chancellor, will not refuse the state the right to keep those pests away from the national community within the framework of moral law.\" \n\nIn his notes on the November 1936 meeting Faulhaber recorded that Hitler \"spoke openly, confidentially, emotionally, at times in a spiritual way he lashed out at Bolshevism and at the Jews\" saying 'How the sub-humans, incited by the Jews, created havoc in Spain like beasts.\" Faulhaber noted \"on this he was well informed. ... He would not miss the historical moment.\" Faulhaber recalled to Hitler how he had been present when Pope Pius XI said that Hitler was the first statesman who had agreed with the Pope about the danger of Bolshevism.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 207.</ref> Friedl\u00e4nder comments that Faulhaber seemed to agree with Hitler's points by noting Faulhaber's comments \"All of this was expressed by Hitler in a moving way in his great speech at the Nuremberg Party rally.\"<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, 1997, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Hitler discussed with Faulhaber tensions between the Church and Party:\n:Think about all this,  Cardinal, and consult with other leaders of the Church how you can support the great undertaking of National Socialism to prevent the victory of Bolshevism and how you can achieve a peaceful relationship to the state. Either National Socialism and the church are both victorious or they perish together. Rest assured, I shall do away with all these small things that stand in the way of a harmonious co-operation. ... I do not wish to engage in horse trading. You know I am opposed to compromises, but let this be a last attempt.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 208\">Lewy, 1964, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFaulhaber left the meeting convinced that \"Hitler was deeply religious\" and that 'The Reich Chancellor undoubtedly lives in belief in God. ... He recognises Christianity as the builder of Western culture.\"<ref>Hitler, Ian Kershaw, p. 373, 2008, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}</ref> Some modern critics have painted the meeting as a failure on Faulhaber's part with regard to Jews. [[Michael Phayer]], however, notes that Saul Friedl\u00e4nder, based on the what Phayer calls the \"distorted\" work of Ernst Klee, \"tenuously links\" Faulhaber with Nazi racism, but his own analysis of the text of Faulhaber's notes of the meeting leads him to reject this suggestion.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 231, fn. 85.</ref> Phayer observes that the meeting was not about Jews but about church-state relations.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 231.</ref>\n\nOn 18 November, Faulhaber met with leading members of the German hierarchy of cardinals to ask them to warn their parishioners against the errors of communism. On 19 November, [[Pius XI]] announced that communism had  moved to the head of the list of \"errors\" and that a clear statement was needed.  On 25 November, Faulhaber informed the Bavarian bishops that he had promised Hitler that the bishops would issue a new pastoral letter in which they condemned \"Bolshevism which represents the greatest danger for the peace of Europe and the Christian civilization of our country.\"  In addition, Faulhaber stated, the pastoral letter \"will once again affirm our loyalty and positive attitude, demanded by the Fourth Commandment, toward today's form of government and the ''F\u00fchrer.'' \" <ref>Lewy, 208.</ref>\n\nWhen the timetable for this announcement fell through \u2013 suppressed for its reference to state violations against the Reich-Vatican Concordat \u2013 Faulhaber set to work on another draft that he submitted to the German bishops. On 24 December 1936, the German joint hierarchy ordered its priests to read the pastoral letter entitled ''On the Defense against Bolshevism'', from all their pulpits on 3 January 1937. The letter pointed out that the Church's support for  the Nazi battle against Bolshevism would be more effective if the Church were to enjoy the freedoms guaranteed by divine law and the Concordat.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\">Lewy, 1964, p. 210.</ref> Lewy asserts that the letter fulfilled the bishops' share of the bargain made with Hitler by declaring their support for Hitler's foreign policy and by encouraging the Catholic laity to have confidence in Hitlers leadership.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\"/> However, Hitler never kept his part of the \"quid pro quo\" as the Nazis were unsympathetic to the Church's desire for Catholic organisations and schools outside the direct control of the Nazis.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\"/> \n\n\"The pastoral letter's text revealed the capitulation of Faulhaber to Hitler's wishes : \"Bolshevism has begun its march from Russia to the countries of Europe. ... the fateful hour has come for our nation and for the Christian culture of the Western world. ... the F\u00fchrer and Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the march of Bolshevism from afar and turned his mind and energies towards averting this enormous danger.. The German bishops consider it their duty to do their utmost to support the leader of the Reich with every available means in this defense.\"  The bishops also warned Catholics they should not fall into discontent, as \"such a mood has always provided fertile soil for Bolshevik sentiments.\" <ref>Griech-Polelle, p. 130, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence and the Holocaust.</ref>\n\nHe also notes Faulhabers remarks to the German bishops that the comments of \"emigrants\" regarding this pastoral letter were of no consequence (\"we do not care a rap\") and that they all knew who the \"emigrants\" referred to were. In Lewy's opinion Faulhaber is referring to Catholics who had left Germany.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, pp. 209\u2013210\">Lewy, 1964, pp. 209\u2013210.</ref> The Dutch Catholic newspaper \"Der Deutsche Weg\" expressed disappointment of the pastoral letter: \"We find it hard to understand that despite the events of 30 June [i.e. [[Night of the Long Knives]]], despite the inhuman brutalities perpetrated in concentration camps, despite the currency and defamation trials, despite the personal insults against individual princes of the Church, against the Holy Father [i.e., [[Pope|the Pope]]] and the entire Church, and in spite of all the hostile measures amounting to another Kulturkampf, ... the bishops find words of appreciation for what (next to Bolshevism) is their worst enemy.\"<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 211\">Lewy, 1964, p. 211.</ref>\n\nThe French Catholic anti-Nazi newspaper Kulturkampf asserted that \"if the Nazis would only stop their attacks against the Church, National socialism and the German Catholics could again be allies.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 211\"/> [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] describes Faulhaber as sharing in a common illusion of German Christians of a distinction between the F\u00fchrer, whom he thought was well intentioned, and a certain number of Hitler's \"evil associates\".<ref>Johnson, 1976, p. 482.</ref>\nAfter a plot had been uncovered to assassinate Hitler in 1943 Faulhaber was questioned by the Gestapo over his contacts with Carl Goerdeler who was involved with the generals plan.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 316.</ref> He was said to have vigorously condemned the assassination plot and to have affirmed his loyalty to the F\u00fchrer.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 317.</ref>\n\n===Opposition to Nazi policies===\nIn June 1933, Faulhaber complained to Hitler about acts of violence against Catholic journeymen that had taken place in Munich and the arrest of almost one hundred priests.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 101, 73.</ref> He protested that the religious freedom of the church could be threatened by such acts even though the Church had made public expressions of loyalty to the state and a willingness to participate in it.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 102.</ref> Later in the year he complained also to the Bavarian State Chancellery about curbs introduced by the new regime.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 181.</ref> In June 1937, he condemned the arrest of the Jesuit priest Rupert Mayer during a sermon.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 315\">Lewy, 1964, p. 315.</ref> The Catholic Church opposed then, as now, sterilization. When the Nazis proposed introducing compulsory sterilization of people afflicted with certain diseases or disabilities in January 1934 he again protested.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 259\">Lewy, 1964, p. 259.</ref> The German Bishops asked that Catholics in relevant occupations should not be forced to act against their conscience and Church teachings.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 259\"/> The Nazis were hostile to the perceived criticism of the German bishops and accused them of encouraging disobedience.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 260\">Lewy, 1964, p. 260.</ref> Faulhaber responded by asserting:\n:The bishops repeatedly and in no uncertain terms have declared their willingness to promote the peaceful cooperation of the Church and State. However, in those questions where a law of state conflicts with an eternal command of God, the bishops cannot through silence betray their holy office.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 260\"/>\nIn September 1939, Hitler issued an order that sanctioned the killing of people with incurable diseases. Euthanasia was, and still is, against Church teaching. The program was started in secret but when word leaked out Faulhaber was one of the German bishops who protested at the killings and wrote to Minister of Justice:\n:I have deemed it my duty of conscience to speak out in this ethico-legal, non-political question, for as a Catholic bishop I may not remain silent when the preservation of the moral foundations of all public order is at stake.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the Nazis proposed the removal of crucifixes from classrooms that resulted in an eruption of civil disobedience by ordinary Catholics that led to the dropping of the ban.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 315\"/> During the course of the disturbances Faulhaber added his criticism of the ban: \"The German soldier is honoured publicly by being called a crusader against Bolshevism. This title of honour would not be deserved, if at the same time at home war is declared.\"\n\n===Annexation of Austria===\nIn March 1938, the Nazis crossed the Austrian frontier and Austria was declared a province of the German Reich.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 212.</ref> Previously Faulhaber had thought the ringing of Church bells for purely political reasons was not to be encouraged and he refused to order a peal of bells on the eve of the plebiscite{{clarify|date=August 2018}} in March 1936.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 213.</ref> (In February 1919 he had refused to allow the ringing of bells after Kurt Eisner, the Socialist Prime Minister of Bavaria, had been assassinated by a Catholic nobleman).<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 311.</ref> In the aftermath of the Anschluss Faulhaber recommended the issuing of a statement ordering  the ringing of bells in Catholic Churches and exhorting the faithful on 10 April \"in this hour of world historical significance, to pledge their fidelity to the F\u00fchrer and Chancellor of the Reich, Adolf Hitler, and to pray for the peaceful cooperation of Church and State in the Greater German Reich.\" The bells were rung but the Bishops of Bavaria along with others omitted mention of Hitler.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Czechoslovakia===\nIn October 1938, the Nazis crossed the border into Czechoslovakia and occupied the [[Sudetenland]]. Sharing in the widespread relief that war had now been averted Faulhaber suggested sending a telegram, in the  name of the German Bishops Conference, to Hitler. Signed by Bertram it read:\n:The great deed of safeguarding international peace moves the German  episcopate, acting in the name of all Catholics of all the German dioceses, respectfully to tender congratulations and thanks and to order a festive peal of bells on Sunday.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 218.</ref> \nIn 1944 Pope Pius XII wrote to Faulhaber indicating that in the event of a negotiated peace Germany should not have to give up Austria and the Sudeten province of Czechoslovakia.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 58.</ref>\n\n===War with the Soviet Union===\nIn June 1941, the Nazis launched their attack on the Soviet Union which solidified the support of the episcopate for the struggle against Bolshevism and in one instance earned the praise of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 230.</ref> The confiscation of Church bells as part of the war effort was met by Faulhaber with: \"for the dear fatherland we will make also this sacrifice if now it has become necessary for a successful end of the war and for the defeat of Bolshevism.\"<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 231.</ref> As the war in the East turned against the Nazis Faulhaber defended the Church against the Nazi charge that it had become lukewarm towards the cause:\n:Nobody in his heart can possibly wish for an unsuccessful outcome of the war. Every reasonable person knows that in such a case the State and the Church, and organised society altogether, would be overturned by the Russian chaos.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 232.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kardinal-Faulhaber-Stra\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Street named in his honour ''Kardinal-Faulhaber-Stra\u00dfe'', in [[Munich]]. In the background is the [[Munich Frauenkirche]] cathedral.]]\n\n===Negotiating the Concordat===\nFaulhaber was also involved with Cardinal Pacelli in the negotiations of the [[Reichskonkordat]] which was signed on 20 July 1933 and ratified in September of that year.<ref>See Lewy, 2000, pp.&nbsp;72\u20133, 101\u20134.</ref> It was typical policy of the Church to sign Concordats with the nations of Europe and the Church had signed dozens of treaties with all sorts of European nations in the decades prior. The Concordat also sought protection for Catholics when the influence of their traditional protector, the Centre Party, had waned (the party was established when [[Pius IX]] was Pope to defend Catholics during Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s [[anti-Catholic]] program, the [[Kulturkampf]], but by the time of signing of the Concordat the party had lost influence and had been dissolved even before the signing).<ref>Rabbi David G. Dalin, Ph.D ''The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII and His Secret War Against Nazi Germany'', p.&nbsp;60. Regnery Publishing, Inc. (25 July 2005)</ref> Paul Johnson's opinion was that the Kulturkampf had left the German episcopate in a state of fear of once again being considered anti-German and this had encouraged the Church to come to an agreement with Hitler.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1976, p. 481\">Johnson, 1976, p. 481.</ref> Even before the rise of Hitler he believes this attitude was demonstrated by Faulhaber when the Cardinal tried to excel in patriotic rhetoric by describing the first world war as having been undertaken in order to avenge the murder in Sarajevo, believing that it would enter the annals of Christian ethics as 'the prototype of the just war'.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1976, p. 481\"/> According to [[Ronald Rychlak]] Faulhaber was of the opinion that Hitler wanted a concordat with the Vatican for propaganda purposes and counselled caution as Hitler \"sees what a halo his government will have in the eyes of the world if the Pope makes a treaty with him\" nor would German Catholics understand why they had entered into such an agreement when \"a whole row of Catholic officials are sitting in prison.\"<ref>Rychlak, 2000, p. 330, fn. 107.</ref>\nFaulhaber and Pacelli sought through the Concordat to gain a strategic and legal basis to challenge violent repression of the Church, in part for its condemnations of Nazi racial doctrine. The German hierarchy was wary of the precariousness of deals with the government, Faulhaber observing, \"With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered\".<ref>Burleigh, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0wFs8uUIQEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Sacred Causes: The Clash of Religion and Politics, from the Great War to the War on Terror], p. 175, HarperCollins, 2008.</ref> Pacelli is reported to have told the British ambassador to the Holy See: \"I had to choose between an agreement and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.\" He felt that \"a pistol had been held to his head\" and he was negotiating \"with the devil himself.\"<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=1438 ''The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler'']. Catholic Culture.</ref> On 24 July, Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that \"For Germany's prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance.\"<ref>Lapide, p. 102.</ref> In a sermon given in Munich during 1937 Cardinal Faulhaber declared:\n:At a time when the  heads of the major nations in the world faced the new Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its confidence in the new German government. This was a deed of immeasurable significance for the reputation of the new government abroad.<ref>\"Constantine's Sword\", James Carroll, 2002, Houghton Mifflin (Mariner books ed), {{ISBN|978-0-618-21908-7}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Concordat, Faulhaber coupled his comments regarding the agreement with his expectation that the German state would comply with it and, as historian [[Michael Burleigh]] writes, with an appeal for amnesty for victims in concentration camps \u2013 an appeal which Burleigh points out is not noted by Faulhaber's modern-day critics.<ref>Burleigh, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0wFs8uUIQEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Sacred Causes: The Clash of Religion and Politics, from the Great War to the War on Terror], p. 176, HarperCollins, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Austria, Hitler's country of birth, but outside the control of Nazi repression at that time, publicly expressed their view of the Concordat, Nazism, and the situation in Germany in a letter of 23 December 1933: \"The concordat recently concluded between the Holy See and Germany does not mean that the Catholic Church approves of the religious errors of Nazism. Everybody knows how tense is the situation between the Church and State in Germany. . . .  The Catholic Church has never agreed with the three fundamental errors of Nazism, which are first, race madness, second, violent anti-Semitism, and third extreme nationalism.\" The Austrian bishops' letter, the ''New York Times'' noted, \"is regarded as a challenge to national-socialism not only in Austria but also in Germany.\"<ref>New York Times, \"Austrian Bishops Oppose the Nazis: Bid Catholics Support Dollfuss Regime to Avert Situation Like That in Germany\". 23 December 1933, p.&nbsp;8.</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Faulhaber implicitly criticized the violent character of the new Nazi leadership by declaring: \"A state based on right, which strives from the first for a peaceful solution, must win the victory over a state based on might, which seeks to gain right with bloody weapons.\" The speech was widely considered an act of opposition against Hitler's rule.<ref name=\"Speaking Symbol\"/>\n\nIn his Advent 1933 sermon, Faulhaber preached: \"Let us not forget that we were saved not by German blood but by the blood of [[Christ]]!\" in response to Nazi [[racism]]. The SS interpreted the sermon as an intervention in favour of the Jews.<ref name=Friedlaender1997/>\n\nIn 1934 an unknown person fired two shots at the cardinal's study. In 1935 some Nazis called in an open meeting for the killing of Faulhaber.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1949 the council of the Landesverband der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde in Bayern (''Regional Union of Israelitic [Jewish] Communities in Bavaria'') thanked Faulhaber with the following words:\n\n<blockquote>As representatives of the Bavarian Jewish synagogues, we will never forget how you, honourable Mister Cardinal, in the years after 1933, with unseen courage, have defended the ethics of the Old Testament from your pulpits, and how you saved thousands of Jewish persons from terror and lethal violence.<ref>''Als Vertreter der Bayerisches Kultusgemeinden werden wir nie vergessen, wie Sie, verehrter Herr Kardinal, in den Jahren ab 1933 mit einem Mut sondergleichen die Ethik des Alten Testaments von der Kanzel verteidigten und Tausende j\u00fcdischer Menschen vor dem Terror und der Gewalt gesch\u00fctzt haben.''

Faulhaber described Tiso as a \"prelate in good standing\".<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 46\">Phayer, 2000, p. 46.</ref> Tiso was hanged for war crimes and Vatican radio refused to defend him saying \"There are certain laws that must be obeyed no matter how much one loves his country.\" [[Michael Phayer]] blames Faulhaber's mistake on the failure of the Vatican to keep its prelates informed, describing it as a \"dead end for information about genocide.\"<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 46\"/>\n\nAfter the war the German Bishops conference issued a statement that many Germans, including Catholics, had committed war crimes.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 135.</ref> The most controversial section dealing with the issue of personal or collective guilt for the Holocaust caused a rift between the predominantly Catholic population of southern Germany and the Occupational Military Government-United States when the latter censored the bishops' letter. Faulhaber refused to publish a censored version.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 136.</ref> He also said that German Jews should be welcomed back to the country as they belonged just as much as any other Germans, offering to pay for their transportation costs to Germany from Theresienstadt.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 151\">Phayer, 2000, p. 151.</ref> Faulhaber received expressions of gratitude from the Jewish Community Centre, who noted his well-meaning attitude shown to Jews in Munich during the years of persecution.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 151\"/> Faulhaber called antisemitism a scourge of mankind and gave the assurance to an Anglo-American group \"that I will do all in my power to convince the Roman Catholics of Bavaria that they must tear out all remaining anti-Semitism from their hearts.\"<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 152\">Phayer, 2000, p. 152.</ref>  He said he would ask the Pope to issue a pastoral letter on antisemitism.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 181.</ref> Michael Phayer is of the opinion that in practice Faulhaber, along with Cardinal Preysing, accomplished \"little or nothing\" of significance in attacking antisemitism and that this was due to the priorities of the Vatican and the envoy of Pope Pius XII, Bishop Aloysius Muench.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 152\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nFaulhaber remains a controversial personality.

[[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] von Faulhaber rejected the [[Weimar Republic]] as rooted in treason<ref>Michael Kardinal von Faulhaber: Rede zum 62.

Faulhaber  publicly recognized the Nazi government as legitimate, required Catholic clergy to remain loyal to the Nazi government, and maintained bridges between fascism and the Church.<ref>Nazis on the Run, Gerald Steinacher, p. 127; Beth A. Griech-Polelle, ''Antisemitism,Christian Ambivalence and the Holocaust'', pp. 128\u2013129, Indiana University Press, 2007 {{ISBN|0-253-34873-0}}</ref> He ordained Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) as a [[priest]] in 1951, and was the last surviving Cardinal appointed by [[Pope Benedict XV]].\n\nFaulhaber is a controversial figure. Catholic apologists have sought to portray him as a committed anti-Nazi. Others have highlighted his collusion. In 2017 the ''Bund f\u00fcr Geistesfreiheit M\u00fcnchen'', in an open letter demanding the renaming of the Cardinal-Faulhaber-Strasse, called it unbearable that an antisemite like Faulhaber should still be honoured with a street name.  In a September 1933 diary entry Faulhaber had written that he hoped Hitler would succeed in doing what Bismarck had failed to do and 'eradicate the evil of the parliamentary democratic system'.  The open letter cited Faulhaber's [[antisemitic]] hatred of [[Kurt Eisner]], his 1936 extension to the Nazi regime the right to 'take action against the excesses of Judaism in his area', his proclamation in 1936 of 'the unanimous commitment of the German bishops to the Fuhrer and his world historical work' and his 1938 call for Catholics 'to make a vow of allegiance to the Fuhrer in the hour of world history'. <ref> bfg bayern  antisemit und hitler [https://bfg-bayern.de/portal/article/antisemit-und-hitler-verehrer-offener-brief-ob-reiter-fordert-umbenennung-der-m\u00fcnchner]</ref>\n\n==Life until after the First World War==\nMichael Faulhaber was born in Klosterheidenfeld, Bavaria, the third of seven children of the baker Michael Faulhaber (1831\u20131900) and his wife Margarete (1839\u20131911). He was educated at [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in [[Schweinfurt]] and W\u00fcrzburg.  In 1887-88 he was a soldier and non-commissioned officer in the Bavarian army.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Faulhaber, Michael}}</ref> In 1889 he entered the Kilianeum (Catholic) Seminary in W\u00fcrzburg and was ordained on 1 August 1892. Faulhaber was a priest in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] from 1892 until 1910, serving there for six years. His studies included a specialisation in the early Christian writer [[Tertullian]]. In 1895 he graduated from his studies with a doctorate in theology. From 1894 to 1896, he was prefect of the Kilianeum Seminary. From 1896 to 1899, he was engaged in studying manuscripts at the Vatican and other Italian museums. From 1899 to 1903, he was [[privatdocent]] in Greek palaeography, Biblical archaeology, homiletics, and exegesis of the Psalms, at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. In 1900 he visited England to study manuscripts of early Christian literature, spending one semester at Oxford. In 1902 he visited Spain for a similar purpose.<ref name=ea/> In 1903 he became professor of theology at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

On 1 March 1913, he was appointed a Knight of the [[Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown]] by [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Prince Regent Ludwig]]; in accordance with the statutes of this order, Faulhaber was ennobled with the style of \"''[[Ritter]] [[von]] Faulhaber''\".  In 1916 he won the [[Iron Cross]] (as the first clergyman in the [[German Empire]]) at the [[Western Front of World War I|Western Front]] for his frontline support of troops by acting as a [[military chaplain]].<ref name=\"Speaking Symbol\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859826,00.html?promoid=googlep Speaking Symbol] 23 June 1952.

At the national Catholic conference (''Katholiikentag'') of 1922 in Munich, he declared that the Weimar Republic was  a  \"''perjury and betrayal''\", because it had arrived through the overthrow of the legitimate civil authorities, the monarchies, and had included in its constitution the separation of church and state. The declaration disturbed Catholics who were committed to the Weimar Republic. Faulhaber had praised the monarchy a few months earlier at the funeral of [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig]].<ref>Robert Krieg, Catholic Theologians and Nazi Germany, p. 25.</ref>\n\nFaulhaber publicised, and supported by creating an institutional link for the association, the work of ''[[Amici Isra\u00ebl]]''. He supported the group by distributing its writings, saying \"we must ensure wide distribution of the writings of the Amici Israel\" and admonishing preachers to steer clear of any statements that \"might sound in any way anti-Semitic\" \u2013 this even though, \"he himself was somewhat tainted by anti-Semitic stereotypes that placed Jews in the same category as Freemasons and Socialists.\"<ref>Hubert Wolf, Pope and Devil: the Vatican's archives and the Third Reich, pp. 89\u201390, Harvard University Press, 31 May 2010.</ref> Faulhaber was friends with the group's promoter, Sophie Francisca van Leer;<ref>Hill, Roland,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxSLvB-mujcC&dq A time out of joint: A journey from Nazi Germany to post-war Britain], The Radcliffe Press, 30 October 2007.</ref> its special aim was to seek changes to the [[Good Friday]] prayer and some of its Latin phrases like ''pro perfidis Judaeis'' (for treacherous Jews) and ''judaicam perfidiam'' (Jewish treachery) and sought the cessation of the deicide accusation against Jews.

The book of a Catholic author{{who|date=May 2019}} issued later in the year attributed the losses incurred by the [[Bavarian People's Party]] to the neutral position adopted by Faulhaber by asking \"Had the Cardinal not indirectly pointed out the path to be followed in the future?\"<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 29.</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1933, the government supported a nationwide boycott of all Jewish stores and businesses. German bishops discussed possible responses against these measures but Faulhaber was of the opinion it would only make matters worse.<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, 1997, p. 42.</ref> In the days preceding the boycott Cardinal Bertram asked for the opinion of brother bishops on whether the Church should protest. Faulhaber telegrammed Bertram that any such protest would be ''hopeless''. And after the 1 April 1933 [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish-owned-and-operated stores]] Cardinal [[Pius XII|Pacelli]] received a letter from Faulhaber explaining why the Church would not intervene to protect Jews:  \"This is not possible at this time because the struggle against the Jews would at the same time become a struggle against Catholics and because the Jews can help themselves as the sudden end of the boycott shows.\"<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, 1997, p. 43.</ref> To Father Alois Wurm who asked why the Church did not condemn racist persecution in straightforward terms Faulhaber responded that the German episcopacy was \"concerned with questions about Catholic schools, organizations, and sterilization which are more important for the Church in Germany than the Jews; the Jews can help themselves, why should the Jews expect help from the Church?\"<ref>Faulhaber to Wurm 8 April 1933, quoted in Paul O'Shea, ''A  Cross Too Heavy'', pp. 143\u2013144 {{ISBN|978-0-230-11080-9}}</ref> According to [[Saul Friedl\u00e4nder]], \"The 1933 boycott of Jewish businesses was the first major test on a national scale of the attitude of the Christian churches toward the situation of the Jews under the new government.

You are all witnesses for the fact that on all Sundays and holidays at the main service we pray in all churches for the F\u00fchrer as we have promised in the Concordat.

Discussion of the [[Spanish Civil War]] dominated the proceedings. The German bishops fundamentally accepted the Nazi presentation of the role of Bolsheviks in this war \u2013 Goebbels's propaganda ministry instructed reporters to call the Republicans simply ''the Bolsheviks'', and in a letter the joint episcopacy stated; \"German unity should not be sacrificed to religious antagonism, quarrels, contempt and struggles. Rather our national power of resistance must be increased and strengthened so that not only may Europe be freed from Bolshevism by us, but also that the whole civilized world may be indebted to us.\"  \n\nNuncio Cesare Orsenigo arranged for Faulhaber to have a private meeting with Hitler. On 4 November 1936, Faulhaber travelled to Hitler's mountain retreat near [[Berchtesgaden]]. According to [[Michael Burleigh]]'s account of this meeting, Hitler  dominated the conversation, expressing his disappointment in the Church's response to Nazi actions and dismissing the Reich's attacks on the Church \u2013 the meeting sputtering out in a reciprocal lack of understanding.<ref>Burleigh, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0wFs8uUIQEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Sacred Causes: The Clash of Religion and Politics, from the Great War to the War on Terror], p. 188, HarperCollins, 2008.</ref> Historian Beth Griech-Polelle however, delivers a quite different account in which, following Faulhaber's own account, early tension eased as the meeting progressed and when Hitler had argued his goal was to protect the German people from ''congenitally afflicted criminals such as now wreak havoc in Spain'' Faulhaber had immediately replied: \" The Church, Mr Chancellor, will not refuse the state the right to keep those pests away from the national community within the framework of moral law.\" \n\nIn his notes on the November 1936 meeting Faulhaber recorded that Hitler \"spoke openly, confidentially, emotionally, at times in a spiritual way he lashed out at Bolshevism and at the Jews\" saying 'How the sub-humans, incited by the Jews, created havoc in Spain like beasts.\" Faulhaber noted \"on this he was well informed. ... He would not miss the historical moment.\" Faulhaber recalled to Hitler how he had been present when Pope Pius XI said that Hitler was the first statesman who had agreed with the Pope about the danger of Bolshevism.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 207.</ref> Friedl\u00e4nder comments that Faulhaber seemed to agree with Hitler's points by noting Faulhaber's comments \"All of this was expressed by Hitler in a moving way in his great speech at the Nuremberg Party rally.\"<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, 1997, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Hitler discussed with Faulhaber tensions between the Church and Party:\n:Think about all this,  Cardinal, and consult with other leaders of the Church how you can support the great undertaking of National Socialism to prevent the victory of Bolshevism and how you can achieve a peaceful relationship to the state. Either National Socialism and the church are both victorious or they perish together. Rest assured, I shall do away with all these small things that stand in the way of a harmonious co-operation. ... I do not wish to engage in horse trading. You know I am opposed to compromises, but let this be a last attempt.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 208\">Lewy, 1964, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFaulhaber left the meeting convinced that \"Hitler was deeply religious\" and that 'The Reich Chancellor undoubtedly lives in belief in God. ... He recognises Christianity as the builder of Western culture.\"<ref>Hitler, Ian Kershaw, p. 373, 2008, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}</ref> Some modern critics have painted the meeting as a failure on Faulhaber's part with regard to Jews. [[Michael Phayer]], however, notes that Saul Friedl\u00e4nder, based on the what Phayer calls the \"distorted\" work of Ernst Klee, \"tenuously links\" Faulhaber with Nazi racism, but his own analysis of the text of Faulhaber's notes of the meeting leads him to reject this suggestion.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 231, fn. 85.</ref> Phayer observes that the meeting was not about Jews but about church-state relations.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 231.</ref>\n\nOn 18 November, Faulhaber met with leading members of the German hierarchy of cardinals to ask them to warn their parishioners against the errors of communism. On 19 November, [[Pius XI]] announced that communism had  moved to the head of the list of \"errors\" and that a clear statement was needed.  On 25 November, Faulhaber informed the Bavarian bishops that he had promised Hitler that the bishops would issue a new pastoral letter in which they condemned \"Bolshevism which represents the greatest danger for the peace of Europe and the Christian civilization of our country.\"  In addition, Faulhaber stated, the pastoral letter \"will once again affirm our loyalty and positive attitude, demanded by the Fourth Commandment, toward today's form of government and the ''F\u00fchrer.'' \" <ref>Lewy, 208.</ref>\n\nWhen the timetable for this announcement fell through \u2013 suppressed for its reference to state violations against the Reich-Vatican Concordat \u2013 Faulhaber set to work on another draft that he submitted to the German bishops. On 24 December 1936, the German joint hierarchy ordered its priests to read the pastoral letter entitled ''On the Defense against Bolshevism'', from all their pulpits on 3 January 1937. The letter pointed out that the Church's support for  the Nazi battle against Bolshevism would be more effective if the Church were to enjoy the freedoms guaranteed by divine law and the Concordat.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\">Lewy, 1964, p. 210.</ref> Lewy asserts that the letter fulfilled the bishops' share of the bargain made with Hitler by declaring their support for Hitler's foreign policy and by encouraging the Catholic laity to have confidence in Hitlers leadership.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\"/> However, Hitler never kept his part of the \"quid pro quo\" as the Nazis were unsympathetic to the Church's desire for Catholic organisations and schools outside the direct control of the Nazis.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 210\"/> \n\n\"The pastoral letter's text revealed the capitulation of Faulhaber to Hitler's wishes : \"Bolshevism has begun its march from Russia to the countries of Europe. ... the fateful hour has come for our nation and for the Christian culture of the Western world. ... the F\u00fchrer and Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the march of Bolshevism from afar and turned his mind and energies towards averting this enormous danger.. The German bishops consider it their duty to do their utmost to support the leader of the Reich with every available means in this defense.\"  The bishops also warned Catholics they should not fall into discontent, as \"such a mood has always provided fertile soil for Bolshevik sentiments.\" <ref>Griech-Polelle, p. 130, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence and the Holocaust.</ref>\n\nHe also notes Faulhabers remarks to the German bishops that the comments of \"emigrants\" regarding this pastoral letter were of no consequence (\"we do not care a rap\") and that they all knew who the \"emigrants\" referred to were. In Lewy's opinion Faulhaber is referring to Catholics who had left Germany.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, pp. 209\u2013210\">Lewy, 1964, pp. 209\u2013210.</ref> The Dutch Catholic newspaper \"Der Deutsche Weg\" expressed disappointment of the pastoral letter: \"We find it hard to understand that despite the events of 30 June [i.e. [[Night of the Long Knives]]], despite the inhuman brutalities perpetrated in concentration camps, despite the currency and defamation trials, despite the personal insults against individual princes of the Church, against the Holy Father [i.e., [[Pope|the Pope]]] and the entire Church, and in spite of all the hostile measures amounting to another Kulturkampf, ... the bishops find words of appreciation for what (next to Bolshevism) is their worst enemy.\"<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 211\">Lewy, 1964, p. 211.</ref>\n\nThe French Catholic anti-Nazi newspaper Kulturkampf asserted that \"if the Nazis would only stop their attacks against the Church, National socialism and the German Catholics could again be allies.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 211\"/> [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] describes Faulhaber as sharing in a common illusion of German Christians of a distinction between the F\u00fchrer, whom he thought was well intentioned, and a certain number of Hitler's \"evil associates\".<ref>Johnson, 1976, p. 482.</ref>\nAfter a plot had been uncovered to assassinate Hitler in 1943 Faulhaber was questioned by the Gestapo over his contacts with Carl Goerdeler who was involved with the generals plan.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 316.</ref> He was said to have vigorously condemned the assassination plot and to have affirmed his loyalty to the F\u00fchrer.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 317.</ref>\n\n===Opposition to Nazi policies===\nIn June 1933, Faulhaber complained to Hitler about acts of violence against Catholic journeymen that had taken place in Munich and the arrest of almost one hundred priests.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 101, 73.</ref> He protested that the religious freedom of the church could be threatened by such acts even though the Church had made public expressions of loyalty to the state and a willingness to participate in it.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 102.</ref> Later in the year he complained also to the Bavarian State Chancellery about curbs introduced by the new regime.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 181.</ref> In June 1937, he condemned the arrest of the Jesuit priest Rupert Mayer during a sermon.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 315\">Lewy, 1964, p. 315.</ref> The Catholic Church opposed then, as now, sterilization.

However, in those questions where a law of state conflicts with an eternal command of God, the bishops cannot through silence betray their holy office.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 260\"/>\nIn September 1939, Hitler issued an order that sanctioned the killing of people with incurable diseases. Euthanasia was, and still is, against Church teaching. The program was started in secret but when word leaked out Faulhaber was one of the German bishops who protested at the killings and wrote to Minister of Justice:\n:I have deemed it my duty of conscience to speak out in this ethico-legal, non-political question, for as a Catholic bishop I may not remain silent when the preservation of the moral foundations of all public order is at stake.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the Nazis proposed the removal of crucifixes from classrooms that resulted in an eruption of civil disobedience by ordinary Catholics that led to the dropping of the ban.<ref name=\"Lewy, 1964, p. 315\"/> During the course of the disturbances Faulhaber added his criticism of the ban: \"The German soldier is honoured publicly by being called a crusader against Bolshevism. This title of honour would not be deserved, if at the same time at home war is declared.\"\n\n===Annexation of Austria===\nIn March 1938, the Nazis crossed the Austrian frontier and Austria was declared a province of the German Reich.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 212.</ref> Previously Faulhaber had thought the ringing of Church bells for purely political reasons was not to be encouraged and he refused to order a peal of bells on the eve of the plebiscite{{clarify|date=August 2018}} in March 1936.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 213.</ref> (In February 1919 he had refused to allow the ringing of bells after Kurt Eisner, the Socialist Prime Minister of Bavaria, had been assassinated by a Catholic nobleman).<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 311.</ref> In the aftermath of the Anschluss Faulhaber recommended the issuing of a statement ordering  the ringing of bells in Catholic Churches and exhorting the faithful on 10 April \"in this hour of world historical significance, to pledge their fidelity to the F\u00fchrer and Chancellor of the Reich, Adolf Hitler, and to pray for the peaceful cooperation of Church and State in the Greater German Reich.\" The bells were rung but the Bishops of Bavaria along with others omitted mention of Hitler.<ref>Lewy, 1964, pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>\n\n===Invasion of Czechoslovakia===\nIn October 1938, the Nazis crossed the border into Czechoslovakia and occupied the [[Sudetenland]]. Sharing in the widespread relief that war had now been averted Faulhaber suggested sending a telegram, in the  name of the German Bishops Conference, to Hitler. Signed by Bertram it read:\n:The great deed of safeguarding international peace moves the German  episcopate, acting in the name of all Catholics of all the German dioceses, respectfully to tender congratulations and thanks and to order a festive peal of bells on Sunday.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 218.</ref> \nIn 1944 Pope Pius XII wrote to Faulhaber indicating that in the event of a negotiated peace Germany should not have to give up Austria and the Sudeten province of Czechoslovakia.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 58.</ref>\n\n===War with the Soviet Union===\nIn June 1941, the Nazis launched their attack on the Soviet Union which solidified the support of the episcopate for the struggle against Bolshevism and in one instance earned the praise of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 230.</ref> The confiscation of Church bells as part of the war effort was met by Faulhaber with: \"for the dear fatherland we will make also this sacrifice if now it has become necessary for a successful end of the war and for the defeat of Bolshevism.\"<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 231.</ref> As the war in the East turned against the Nazis Faulhaber defended the Church against the Nazi charge that it had become lukewarm towards the cause:\n:Nobody in his heart can possibly wish for an unsuccessful outcome of the war. Every reasonable person knows that in such a case the State and the Church, and organised society altogether, would be overturned by the Russian chaos.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 232.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kardinal-Faulhaber-Stra\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Street named in his honour ''Kardinal-Faulhaber-Stra\u00dfe'', in [[Munich]].

Dalin, Ph.D ''The Myth of Hitler's Pope: Pope Pius XII and His Secret War Against Nazi Germany'', p.&nbsp;60. Regnery Publishing, Inc. (25 July 2005)</ref> Paul Johnson's opinion was that the Kulturkampf had left the German episcopate in a state of fear of once again being considered anti-German and this had encouraged the Church to come to an agreement with Hitler.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1976, p. 481\">Johnson, 1976, p. 481.</ref> Even before the rise of Hitler he believes this attitude was demonstrated by Faulhaber when the Cardinal tried to excel in patriotic rhetoric by describing the first world war as having been undertaken in order to avenge the murder in Sarajevo, believing that it would enter the annals of Christian ethics as 'the prototype of the just war'.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1976, p. 481\"/> According to [[Ronald Rychlak]] Faulhaber was of the opinion that Hitler wanted a concordat with the Vatican for propaganda purposes and counselled caution as Hitler \"sees what a halo his government will have in the eyes of the world if the Pope makes a treaty with him\" nor would German Catholics understand why they had entered into such an agreement when \"a whole row of Catholic officials are sitting in prison.\"<ref>Rychlak, 2000, p. 330, fn. 107.</ref>\nFaulhaber and Pacelli sought through the Concordat to gain a strategic and legal basis to challenge violent repression of the Church, in part for its condemnations of Nazi racial doctrine. The German hierarchy was wary of the precariousness of deals with the government, Faulhaber observing, \"With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered\".<ref>Burleigh, Michael, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0wFs8uUIQEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Sacred Causes: The Clash of Religion and Politics, from the Great War to the War on Terror], p. 175, HarperCollins, 2008.</ref> Pacelli is reported to have told the British ambassador to the Holy See: \"I had to choose between an agreement and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.\" He felt that \"a pistol had been held to his head\" and he was negotiating \"with the devil himself.\"<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=1438 ''The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler'']. Catholic Culture.</ref> On 24 July, Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that \"For Germany's prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance.\"<ref>Lapide, p. 102.</ref> In a sermon given in Munich during 1937 Cardinal Faulhaber declared:\n:At a time when the  heads of the major nations in the world faced the new Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its confidence in the new German government.

Everybody knows how tense is the situation between the Church and State in Germany. . . .  The Catholic Church has never agreed with the three fundamental errors of Nazism, which are first, race madness, second, violent anti-Semitism, and third extreme nationalism.\" The Austrian bishops' letter, the ''New York Times'' noted, \"is regarded as a challenge to national-socialism not only in Austria but also in Germany.\"<ref>New York Times, \"Austrian Bishops Oppose the Nazis: Bid Catholics Support Dollfuss Regime to Avert Situation Like That in Germany\". 23 December 1933, p.&nbsp;8.</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Faulhaber implicitly criticized the violent character of the new Nazi leadership by declaring: \"A state based on right, which strives from the first for a peaceful solution, must win the victory over a state based on might, which seeks to gain right with bloody weapons.\" The speech was widely considered an act of opposition against Hitler's rule.<ref name=\"Speaking Symbol\"/>\n\nIn his Advent 1933 sermon, Faulhaber preached: \"Let us not forget that we were saved not by German blood but by the blood of [[Christ]]!\" in response to Nazi [[racism]]. The SS interpreted the sermon as an intervention in favour of the Jews.<ref name=Friedlaender1997/>\n\nIn 1934 an unknown person fired two shots at the cardinal's study. In 1935 some Nazis called in an open meeting for the killing of Faulhaber.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1949 the council of the Landesverband der Israelitischen Kultusgemeinde in Bayern (''Regional Union of Israelitic [Jewish] Communities in Bavaria'') thanked Faulhaber with the following words:\n\n<blockquote>As representatives of the Bavarian Jewish synagogues, we will never forget how you, honourable Mister Cardinal, in the years after 1933, with unseen courage, have defended the ethics of the Old Testament from your pulpits, and how you saved thousands of Jewish persons from terror and lethal violence.<ref>''Als Vertreter der Bayerisches Kultusgemeinden werden wir nie vergessen, wie Sie, verehrter Herr Kardinal, in den Jahren ab 1933 mit einem Mut sondergleichen die Ethik des Alten Testaments von der Kanzel verteidigten und Tausende j\u00fcdischer Menschen vor dem Terror und der Gewalt gesch\u00fctzt haben.''

Faulhaber described Tiso as a \"prelate in good standing\".<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 46\">Phayer, 2000, p. 46.</ref> Tiso was hanged for war crimes and Vatican radio refused to defend him saying \"There are certain laws that must be obeyed no matter how much one loves his country.\" [[Michael Phayer]] blames Faulhaber's mistake on the failure of the Vatican to keep its prelates informed, describing it as a \"dead end for information about genocide.\"<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 46\"/>\n\nAfter the war the German Bishops conference issued a statement that many Germans, including Catholics, had committed war crimes.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 135.</ref> The most controversial section dealing with the issue of personal or collective guilt for the Holocaust caused a rift between the predominantly Catholic population of southern Germany and the Occupational Military Government-United States when the latter censored the bishops' letter. Faulhaber refused to publish a censored version.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 136.</ref> He also said that German Jews should be welcomed back to the country as they belonged just as much as any other Germans, offering to pay for their transportation costs to Germany from Theresienstadt.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 151\">Phayer, 2000, p. 151.</ref> Faulhaber received expressions of gratitude from the Jewish Community Centre, who noted his well-meaning attitude shown to Jews in Munich during the years of persecution.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 151\"/> Faulhaber called antisemitism a scourge of mankind and gave the assurance to an Anglo-American group \"that I will do all in my power to convince the Roman Catholics of Bavaria that they must tear out all remaining anti-Semitism from their hearts.\"<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 152\">Phayer, 2000, p. 152.</ref>  He said he would ask the Pope to issue a pastoral letter on antisemitism.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 181.</ref> Michael Phayer is of the opinion that in practice Faulhaber, along with Cardinal Preysing, accomplished \"little or nothing\" of significance in attacking antisemitism and that this was due to the priorities of the Vatican and the envoy of Pope Pius XII, Bishop Aloysius Muench.<ref name=\"Phayer, 2000, p. 152\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nFaulhaber remains a controversial personality. The Nazis reportedly considered Faulhaber a \"friend of the Jews\" and a Catholic \"reactionary\" (the term used by the Nazis to refer to opponents of the Nazis who were not left-wing).<ref>Peter Pfister, Susanne Kornacker, Volker Laube (ed.)

It is explained in the comics that Quan Chi remade his original body with magic, making him no longer a cyborg. During the war, as Quan Chi suffers a defeat, he loses control over the souls of Sub Zero, Scorpion and Jax, effectively resurrecting them. 25 years later and after the comic book prequel, Kuai Liang becomes the new grandmaster of the Lin Kuei, thanks to Kung Jin's help whom he and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] hired to steal a data stick containing a computer virus. He later uses this virus to free [[Cyrax]] and other human Lin Kuei warriors turned cyborgs from Sektor's enslavement. He would also make amends with Scorpion by revealing that Sektor and Quan Chi were involved in the murder of Hanzo's family and clan, as well as Bi-Han's downfall. Five years later, he helps [[Johnny Cage]]'s team of recruited warriors by testing them at the Lin Kuei temple. Sub-Zero eventually witnesses the Jinsei's corruption by Shinnok. He later finds Cassie Cage's team ambushed by [[Kotal Kahn]]'s Outworld army, and alongside his clan, drives Kotal's army back to Outworld, allowing Cassie's team to reach a now compromised Shaolin Temple to stop Shinnok. Sub-Zero's cybernetic form is reused in ''Mortal Kombat X'' as a DLC and hidden variation for Triborg who can also take the form of Cyrax, Sektor and [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Cyber Smoke]].\n\nWhen the time anomaly caused by Kronika occurs in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Sub-Zero survived the kidnapping and massacre by the advanced time-displaced Cyber Lin Kuei, but Frost is missing after abandoning Lin Kuei, so he alerted Scorpion of the Cyber Lin Kuei's return. Though they were too late to save his clansmen, Sub-Zero and Scorpion infiltrate the factory to shut it down once again, with the past Cyrax's help. They soon found out Frost became the first ever female cyborg, and Sektor's most-trusted second in-command and successor by will, much to their disgust of her betrayal by her own pride and envy for joining the likes of Kronika. Once they freed Cyrax, as well as defeating Frost, Noob Saibot and Sektor, Sub-Zero promises Cyrax to find a way to restore him, no matter what forms but retain his humanity, before the freed cyborg uses his life to shut down the factory. Due to the destruction of his Lin Kuei base, including Shaolin Sky Temple and Special Force HQ, Sub-Zero and the surviving allied forces shelters in Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden where they learned from Raiden about Kronika's connection to both Shinnok and Cetrion, her schemes, and Elder Gods' perish by her and her daughter's hands, leaving Raiden as the sole survivor. Sub-Zero and Scorpion later scout out the home of the Netherrealm's guardian Kharon, where Scorpion tells Sub-Zero to return to Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden while he saves Kharon. The younger, revenant Scorpion returns after D'Vorah kills his older counterpart, leading to a brief fight between him and Sub-Zero as he, as well as Raiden did not trust Hanzo's younger counterpart, though Liu Kang soon realize shortly that Scorpion really want to redeem himself on his late-future human-self's behalf, eventually forgives him once Raiden unlocks the visions of the previously defunct timelines caused by Kronika's machinations. Later, he and the younger Scorpion team up to aid Earthrealm's forces in the attack on Kronika's Keep, where Raiden, who manage to return older Jax back to the good side confirms Sub-Zero that Frost is indeed the backup commander of Cyber Lin Kuei, should Sektor die. In Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, he defeats Kronika and begins to craft the sands of time to start a new timeline, but before he would do that, he began to think of Bi-Han and understand his past history with Sektor and as his time as Noob Saibot. Sub-Zero then crafts a reality where he frees Bi-Han and fights side by side with his brother once again.\n\nKuai Liang is playable in the [[Fictional crossovers in video games|crossover]] title ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', involved in a war between the eponymous fictional universes and is the protagonist for one chapter of the story mode. In Sub-Zero's ending, he realizes he is no longer the assassin he once was and leaves the Lin Kuei. Inspired by [[Batman]], he becomes a [[superhero]] donning a new costume with a cape; unknown to him, the Lin Kuei are on his trail because they do not tolerate desertion.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]] |developer=Midway Amusement Games |publisher=Midway Games |date=2008 |level=Chapter 4: Sub-Zero}}</ref> Sub-Zero makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' during Scorpion's intro, in which Scorpion is about to perform a fatality on the downed Sub-Zero before being pulled into the [[DC Universe]]. Sub-Zero appears as a playable character alongside Raiden via downloadable content in the game's sequel, ''[[Injustice 2]]''. Despite having some references from his crossover appearance in ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'', Sub-Zero's ending is revealed to have taken place while he was forcing Kotal's army back to Outworld in ''Mortal Kombat X'', when suddenly Sub-Zero was transported into DC's ''Injustice'' universe. In his ending, after he defeats [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], Batman offers to help him return to his universe. Sub-Zero becomes a teacher to the three youngest members of Batman's [[Justice League]] ([[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], and [[Firestorm#Jason Rusch|Firestorm]]) in the process, while waiting for Batman to develop a portal to the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe, which accidentally frees [[Superman]] as well as Superman's new Kryptonian allies [[General Zod]], Ursa, and Non from the [[Phantom Zone]] instead.

The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' as a result of Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', his scar has faded to the point where it can no longer be seen. He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Dynastic era Chinese]] battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' villain, the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a [[Qing Dynasty]]-era hairstyle. In ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from ''Deadly Alliance'', retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from ''Deception''). Since ''Deadly Alliance'', Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from ''Deadly Alliance'' depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in ''Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks'' was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that \"we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him\" and commented that Sub-Zero's design in ''Mortal Kombat'' was difficult to make although most people called it \"simple\". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.<ref name=\"devd\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/forum/showmessage.cds?id=52997|title=Developer Diary#3: Characters|publisher=Mortal Kombat Online|author=Himmerick, Shaun|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> His appearance in ''Injustice 2'' was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/jimlee/status/860660286167973889|title=Jim Lee on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen he first appeared in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Sub-Zero featured only two special moves: his ice blast and sliding kick. These moves have become Sub-Zero's trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (''Mortal Kombat II'' and subsequent games feature the younger Sub-Zero). ''Mortal Kombat II'' added his ground freeze move, and two new [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] including the now-famous one where he would freeze and shatter the victim. According to Boon, Sub-Zero's Freeze was originally omitted from the game in place of the Ice Shower, but was brought back in the next revision following fan feedback at a local arcade.<ref name=\"egm95\" /> Sub-Zero's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''-inspired<ref>Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012</ref> Fatality, the \"Spine Rip,\" is considered by Boon to be his favorite Fatality from the first game as well as the most controversial.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=\"The History of Fatalities\" commentary}}</ref> Some home versions of the first game replaced the \"Spine Rip\" with another finishing move due to its violent content.<ref name=\"artgr\" /> Unlike other returning characters whose moves remained intact, this Fatality was not carried over to ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat 3,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |title=The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities at IGN |publisher=Uk.xbox360.ign.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327034223/http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}</ref> but was brought back in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as one of Classic Sub-Zero's finishers. However, the move was intentionally censored by Midway; right after he grabbed onto his opponent, the screen went black and only the resulting sound effects were heard. This was due to the development team choosing not to animate the spine rip fatality for each of the updated character sprites in the game. The [[Nintendo 64]] port of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' gives all of the younger Sub-Zero's special techniques and finishing moves to the classic masked version, due to the fact the N64's cartridge format had memory restrictions that did not allow the use of both masked and unmasked characters. The developers had to remove the \"Spine Rip\" from ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' as that game was aimed at a younger audience.<ref name=\"booninter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|title=Ed Boon talks Mortal Kombat secrets, MK vs. DC, and the future of M-rated fighters|publisher=GamePro|author=Shuman, Sid|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223113402/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|archivedate=December 23, 2008}}</ref> Sub-Zero also gained a teleporting move in the game in which he freezes himself and falls back to the ground, appearing behind the foe.<ref name=\"dcinter\"/>\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Blood & Thunder]]'' series, the elder Sub-Zero is featured, seeking Shang Tsung's death faithful to his game profile. Accompanied by fellow Lin Kuei member Hydro (an original character created for the comics), he confronted Scorpion and surpassed his fear of him when he realized that was what fuelled the specter's powers. Like the other characters, he pursued the powers of the Tao Te Zhan. In the ''Battlewave'' series, Sub-Zero allied himself with [[Kitana]], Kung Lao, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] to overthrow [[Shao Kahn]]. During the final ''Tournament Edition'' issue, Sub-Zero is depicted as being the victor of Shao Kahn's tournament, defeating [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] and claiming the Dragon Medallion, despite being mortally wounded by [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. The ''Mortal Kombat 3'' version of Sub-Zero made a cameo appearance in the epilogue of [[Malibu Comics]]' 1995 ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Battlewave]]'' miniseries, in which he froze a group of Lin Kuei while proclaiming that the clan was corrupted and no longer worthy of his services. This subplot was never developed as the ''Mortal Kombat'' comic book series folded shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the first ''Mortal Kombat'' movie, the elder Sub-Zero was played by [[Fran\u00e7ois Petit]] and served as one of Shang Tsung's guardians alongside Scorpion in the tournament. Although Shang Tsung does make a reference to the rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero early in the film, their relationship is not explored and both are slaves under the sorcerer's command. He is killed in combat by Liu Kang when he is impaled and frozen.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Goldman, Michael  |author2=Aaron, Richard E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mortal Kombat: The Movie|year=1995 |publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0-7615-0082-0}}</ref> In the animated film ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]'', a prequel to live-action film, the elder Sub-Zero was once again featured alongside Scorpion as servants to Shang Tsung and their feud was explained by Raiden through flashbacks, although interpreted differently from that in the games.<ref>{{cite video |date = 1995 |title = [[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]] |type = VHS |publisher = New Line}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MKASUB-ZERO.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Cooke]] as Sub-Zero in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'']]\n\nThe younger Sub-Zero made an appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Keith Cooke]], who had played [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] in the first movie. After saving both Liu Kang and Kitana from an ambush by Smoke, Sub-Zero has an inconclusive fight with Scorpion, who kidnaps Kitana and escapes.

The two fought to a draw and Scorpion escaped when Kung Lao and his friends came to Sub-Zero's aid.

In the next episode it is revealed that Quan Chi impersonated him in order to deceive Scorpion into believing that Sub-Zero murdered his family and clan to enact a false sense of vengeance in him against Bi-Han and gain his allegiance for the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament.

When they become adults, Kuai Liang threatens Hanzo and his family while out for a walk and Hanzo is forced to kill Kuai Liang. Bi-Han, believing Hanzo was protecting his family, decides to end the feud between their two clans out of respect for his friend. He becomes saddened and enraged by the fact that his clan had supposedly killed Hanzo, his family, and his clan. He then discovers that Quan Chi had impersonated him. Having been chosen to fight for Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat, he encounters Hanzo on the battlefield. Bi-Han's efforts to explain himself to Hanzo are fruitless, as Hanzo is now an undead specter only responding to the name Scorpion, who then kills Bi-Han by ripping out his spine.\n\n[[Joe Taslim]] will portray the Bi-Han version of Sub-Zero in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/raid-actor-joe-taslim-play-zero-mortal-kombat-movie-1222984|title='Mortal Kombat' Movie Finds Its Sub-Zero (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Galuppo|first=Mia|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA brief image of Sub-Zero can be seen in the short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'' where dialogue implies a deadly rivalry between him and Hanzo Hasashi.

It is explained in the comics that Quan Chi remade his original body with magic, making him no longer a cyborg. During the war, as Quan Chi suffers a defeat, he loses control over the souls of Sub Zero, Scorpion and Jax, effectively resurrecting them. 25 years later and after the comic book prequel, Kuai Liang becomes the new grandmaster of the Lin Kuei, thanks to Kung Jin's help whom he and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] hired to steal a data stick containing a computer virus. He later uses this virus to free [[Cyrax]] and other human Lin Kuei warriors turned cyborgs from Sektor's enslavement. He would also make amends with Scorpion by revealing that Sektor and Quan Chi were involved in the murder of Hanzo's family and clan, as well as Bi-Han's downfall. Five years later, he helps [[Johnny Cage]]'s team of recruited warriors by testing them at the Lin Kuei temple. Sub-Zero eventually witnesses the Jinsei's corruption by Shinnok. He later finds Cassie Cage's team ambushed by [[Kotal Kahn]]'s Outworld army, and alongside his clan, drives Kotal's army back to Outworld, allowing Cassie's team to reach a now compromised Shaolin Temple to stop Shinnok. Sub-Zero's cybernetic form is reused in ''Mortal Kombat X'' as a DLC and hidden variation for Triborg who can also take the form of Cyrax, Sektor and [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Cyber Smoke]].\n\nWhen the time anomaly caused by Kronika occurs in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Sub-Zero survived the kidnapping and massacre by the advanced time-displaced Cyber Lin Kuei, but Frost is missing after abandoning Lin Kuei, so he alerted Scorpion of the Cyber Lin Kuei's return. Though they were too late to save his clansmen, Sub-Zero and Scorpion infiltrate the factory to shut it down once again, with the past Cyrax's help. They soon found out Frost became the first ever female cyborg, and Sektor's most-trusted second in-command and successor by will, much to their disgust of her betrayal by her own pride and envy for joining the likes of Kronika. Once they freed Cyrax, as well as defeating Frost, Noob Saibot and Sektor, Sub-Zero promises Cyrax to find a way to restore him, no matter what forms but retain his humanity, before the freed cyborg uses his life to shut down the factory. Due to the destruction of his Lin Kuei base, including Shaolin Sky Temple and Special Force HQ, Sub-Zero and the surviving allied forces shelters in Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden where they learned from Raiden about Kronika's connection to both Shinnok and Cetrion, her schemes, and Elder Gods' perish by her and her daughter's hands, leaving Raiden as the sole survivor. Sub-Zero and Scorpion later scout out the home of the Netherrealm's guardian Kharon, where Scorpion tells Sub-Zero to return to Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden while he saves Kharon. The younger, revenant Scorpion returns after D'Vorah kills his older counterpart, leading to a brief fight between him and Sub-Zero as he, as well as Raiden did not trust Hanzo's younger counterpart, though Liu Kang soon realize shortly that Scorpion really want to redeem himself on his late-future human-self's behalf, eventually forgives him once Raiden unlocks the visions of the previously defunct timelines caused by Kronika's machinations. Later, he and the younger Scorpion team up to aid Earthrealm's forces in the attack on Kronika's Keep, where Raiden, who manage to return older Jax back to the good side confirms Sub-Zero that Frost is indeed the backup commander of Cyber Lin Kuei, should Sektor die. In Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, he defeats Kronika and begins to craft the sands of time to start a new timeline, but before he would do that, he began to think of Bi-Han and understand his past history with Sektor and as his time as Noob Saibot. Sub-Zero then crafts a reality where he frees Bi-Han and fights side by side with his brother once again.\n\nKuai Liang is playable in the [[Fictional crossovers in video games|crossover]] title ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', involved in a war between the eponymous fictional universes and is the protagonist for one chapter of the story mode. In Sub-Zero's ending, he realizes he is no longer the assassin he once was and leaves the Lin Kuei. Inspired by [[Batman]], he becomes a [[superhero]] donning a new costume with a cape; unknown to him, the Lin Kuei are on his trail because they do not tolerate desertion.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]] |developer=Midway Amusement Games |publisher=Midway Games |date=2008 |level=Chapter 4: Sub-Zero}}</ref> Sub-Zero makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' during Scorpion's intro, in which Scorpion is about to perform a fatality on the downed Sub-Zero before being pulled into the [[DC Universe]]. Sub-Zero appears as a playable character alongside Raiden via downloadable content in the game's sequel, ''[[Injustice 2]]''. Despite having some references from his crossover appearance in ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'', Sub-Zero's ending is revealed to have taken place while he was forcing Kotal's army back to Outworld in ''Mortal Kombat X'', when suddenly Sub-Zero was transported into DC's ''Injustice'' universe. In his ending, after he defeats [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], Batman offers to help him return to his universe. Sub-Zero becomes a teacher to the three youngest members of Batman's [[Justice League]] ([[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], and [[Firestorm#Jason Rusch|Firestorm]]) in the process, while waiting for Batman to develop a portal to the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe, which accidentally frees [[Superman]] as well as Superman's new Kryptonian allies [[General Zod]], Ursa, and Non from the [[Phantom Zone]] instead.

The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' as a result of Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', his scar has faded to the point where it can no longer be seen. He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Dynastic era Chinese]] battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' villain, the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a [[Qing Dynasty]]-era hairstyle. In ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from ''Deadly Alliance'', retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from ''Deception''). Since ''Deadly Alliance'', Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from ''Deadly Alliance'' depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in ''Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks'' was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that \"we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him\" and commented that Sub-Zero's design in ''Mortal Kombat'' was difficult to make although most people called it \"simple\". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.<ref name=\"devd\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/forum/showmessage.cds?id=52997|title=Developer Diary#3: Characters|publisher=Mortal Kombat Online|author=Himmerick, Shaun|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> His appearance in ''Injustice 2'' was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/jimlee/status/860660286167973889|title=Jim Lee on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen he first appeared in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Sub-Zero featured only two special moves: his ice blast and sliding kick. These moves have become Sub-Zero's trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (''Mortal Kombat II'' and subsequent games feature the younger Sub-Zero). ''Mortal Kombat II'' added his ground freeze move, and two new [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] including the now-famous one where he would freeze and shatter the victim. According to Boon, Sub-Zero's Freeze was originally omitted from the game in place of the Ice Shower, but was brought back in the next revision following fan feedback at a local arcade.<ref name=\"egm95\" /> Sub-Zero's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''-inspired<ref>Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012</ref> Fatality, the \"Spine Rip,\" is considered by Boon to be his favorite Fatality from the first game as well as the most controversial.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=\"The History of Fatalities\" commentary}}</ref> Some home versions of the first game replaced the \"Spine Rip\" with another finishing move due to its violent content.<ref name=\"artgr\" /> Unlike other returning characters whose moves remained intact, this Fatality was not carried over to ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat 3,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |title=The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities at IGN |publisher=Uk.xbox360.ign.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327034223/http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}</ref> but was brought back in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as one of Classic Sub-Zero's finishers. However, the move was intentionally censored by Midway; right after he grabbed onto his opponent, the screen went black and only the resulting sound effects were heard. This was due to the development team choosing not to animate the spine rip fatality for each of the updated character sprites in the game. The [[Nintendo 64]] port of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' gives all of the younger Sub-Zero's special techniques and finishing moves to the classic masked version, due to the fact the N64's cartridge format had memory restrictions that did not allow the use of both masked and unmasked characters. The developers had to remove the \"Spine Rip\" from ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' as that game was aimed at a younger audience.<ref name=\"booninter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|title=Ed Boon talks Mortal Kombat secrets, MK vs. DC, and the future of M-rated fighters|publisher=GamePro|author=Shuman, Sid|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223113402/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|archivedate=December 23, 2008}}</ref> Sub-Zero also gained a teleporting move in the game in which he freezes himself and falls back to the ground, appearing behind the foe.<ref name=\"dcinter\"/>\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Blood & Thunder]]'' series, the elder Sub-Zero is featured, seeking Shang Tsung's death faithful to his game profile. Accompanied by fellow Lin Kuei member Hydro (an original character created for the comics), he confronted Scorpion and surpassed his fear of him when he realized that was what fuelled the specter's powers. Like the other characters, he pursued the powers of the Tao Te Zhan. In the ''Battlewave'' series, Sub-Zero allied himself with [[Kitana]], Kung Lao, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] to overthrow [[Shao Kahn]].

The ''Mortal Kombat 3'' version of Sub-Zero made a cameo appearance in the epilogue of [[Malibu Comics]]' 1995 ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Battlewave]]'' miniseries, in which he froze a group of Lin Kuei while proclaiming that the clan was corrupted and no longer worthy of his services.

In the next episode it is revealed that Quan Chi impersonated him in order to deceive Scorpion into believing that Sub-Zero murdered his family and clan to enact a false sense of vengeance in him against Bi-Han and gain his allegiance for the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament.

When they become adults, Kuai Liang threatens Hanzo and his family while out for a walk and Hanzo is forced to kill Kuai Liang. Bi-Han, believing Hanzo was protecting his family, decides to end the feud between their two clans out of respect for his friend. He becomes saddened and enraged by the fact that his clan had supposedly killed Hanzo, his family, and his clan. He then discovers that Quan Chi had impersonated him. Having been chosen to fight for Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat, he encounters Hanzo on the battlefield. Bi-Han's efforts to explain himself to Hanzo are fruitless, as Hanzo is now an undead specter only responding to the name Scorpion, who then kills Bi-Han by ripping out his spine.\n\n[[Joe Taslim]] will portray the Bi-Han version of Sub-Zero in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/raid-actor-joe-taslim-play-zero-mortal-kombat-movie-1222984|title='Mortal Kombat' Movie Finds Its Sub-Zero (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Galuppo|first=Mia|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA brief image of Sub-Zero can be seen in the short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'' where dialogue implies a deadly rivalry between him and Hanzo Hasashi.

It has only recently been identified as a human disease (2017) and has yet to be confirmed by a second academic center.  \n\nCompression of the [[trigeminal nerve]] can cause [[trigeminal neuralgia]], compression of the facial nerve can cause [[hemifacial spasm]], and compression of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] can cause glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Compression of the vagus nerve can cause hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm. \n\n==Signs and Symptoms==\nPatients with HeLPS describe a recognizable pattern of symptoms that include episodic choking and coughing. The choking is due to a unilateral contraction of the throat. If the contraction is in the [[pharynx]], the patient will typically be able to detect which side of the throat is affected. Even a bystander may be able to feel that the muscles on one side of the throat are in spasm. If the [[larynx]] is affected, however, the patient may not be able to feel which side is affected but will report a circumferential choking. These choking episodes tend to worsen over the years in intensity, frequency and duration. Initially, episodes last for a few seconds but can eventually progress to several minutes. The throat contraction can make breathing difficult causing [[stridor]] (not [[wheezing]]) and the patient have reported losing consciousness. Like hemifacial spasm, HeLPS is one of the very few movement disorders that can occur while sleeping. The unpredictable but inevitable choking episodes typically cause significant anxiety for the patient and may lead to a psychiatric misdiagnosis. The choking episodes can lead to intubation in the emergency room and rarely to elective [[tracheostomy]]. In between episodes, patients are normal. Repeated episodes of spontaneous severe choking followed shortly afterwards by a completely normal examination may also increase the likelihood of a psychiatric misdiagnosis. Patients have described different triggers for these choking episodes including loud or prolonged talking, and exercise but they can also occur spontaneously. \n\nThe coughing episodes are also episodic, progressively severe and eventually nocturnal. They are initiated by a \u201cticking sensation\u201d deep in the throat or more typically behind the [[suprasternal notch]]. This sensation then causes the patient to cough. The cough is therefore a \u2018normal\u2019 response to this ticking sensation rather than an uncontrolled muscular contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] or [[intercostal muscles]]. The coughing episodes can be severe with [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], vomiting, visual [[phosphenes]] (\u201cseeing stars\u201d), and post-tussive headache. These episodes typically progress from mild to severe over the years and eventually will awaken the patient from sleep. In between episodes, the patient is normal and respiratory examination does not reveal reactive airways disease (asthma) or allergies. The coughing episodes can be triggered by loud or prolonged talking, exercise or the choking episodes described above.\n\nSome, but not all, patients also describe episodic changes in their voice. This may be due to unilateral contractions in the muscles controlling the vocal cords. One patient reported that this could be triggered by loud or prolonged talking and would typically last a few minutes. If the episode was mild, their voice would return to normal within a few minutes. If the episode was severe, it would progress into severe choking. Two patients also reported a sensation that their tongue was \u201cfat\u201d during the choking episodes. This may be due to contraction of the [[palatoglossus muscle]]. The combination of choking and a sensation of a \u201cfat\u201d tongue may lead to a misdiagnosis of an allergic reaction.\n\nPatients do not report pain during an episode. This is not glossopharyngeal neuralgia although the condition can co-exist with HeLPS (see below). None of the patients have reported sudden loss of consciousness or [[cardiac arrythmias]] as is rarely seen in some cases of glossopharyngeal neuralgia (so called vago-glossopharyngeal neuralgia). None of the patients have reported gastrointestinal parasympathetic symptomatology such as abdominal pain or diarrhea.

The paper also found 27 patients that had been previously reported in the literature with glossopharyngeal neuralgia and additional symptoms compatible with (but not recognized as) HeLPS. One such patient from the Mayo Clinic series described \"inspiratory stridor\". <ref>\tRushton JG et al. \u201cGlossopharyngeal (vago-glossopharyngeal) neuralgia. A study of 217 cases.\u201d Arch Neurol (1981) 38:201-205</ref> One patient from the Stockholm series in August 1947, \"developed attacks of severe cramps in the throat, a feeling of suffocation and dyspnea.\" <ref> Bohm E and Strang RR. \"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia.\" Brain (1962) 85:371-388</ref>These are not symptoms of glossopharyngeal neuralgia; they are symptoms of HeLPS. \n\n==Cause ==\nNeurovascular compression syndromes are due to compression of a [[cranial nerve]]. Compression of the trigeminal neural can cause trigeminal neuralgia and [[microvascular decompression]] (MVD) of the nerve can cure that condition .<ref> Jannetta PJ \u201cArterial compression of the trigeminal nerve at the pons in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.\u201d J Neurosurg (1967) 26:159-162 </ref> Trigeminal neuralgia is far more common than HeLPS and its painful sensory symptoms are often well controlled with anti-epileptic medications.

Compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve can cause glossopharyngeal neuralgia and MVD of the nerve can cure that condition.<ref> Sindou M et al. \u201cMicrosurgical vascular decompression (MVD) in trigeminal and vago-glossopharyngeal neuralgias. A twenty year experience.\u201d Acta Neurochir Suppl(Wien) (1993) 58:168-170 </ref> This is a rare condition and is very similar to trigeminal neuralgia except the pain is in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm is due to unilateral compression of the vagus nerve and can be cured with MVD of the nerve. Every reported case of HeLPS has been due to compression of the vagus nerve by a loop of the [[posterior inferior cerebellar artery]] (PICA). <ref> Honey et al. \u201cEpisodic hemilaryngpharyngeal spasm (HELPS) syndrome: case report of a surgically treatable novel neuropathy.\u201d J Neurosurg (2017) 126:1653-1656 </ref> <ref> Honey et al. \u201cHemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm as a novel cause of inducible laryngeal obstruction with a surgical cure: report of 3 cases.\u201d J Neurosurg (2018) doi: 10.3171/2018.2JNS172952 </ref> The compression can occur at the root entry zone of the nerve or in its cisternal portion. No nerve biopsies have been performed to investigate the pathology at the compression site but it is assumed to be similar to compressions previously reported of the trigeminal and facial nerves.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis of hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm, like any medical condition, can be made by history, physical examination and special tests. The history of symptoms will be reported by the patient and should match the descriptions provided above. A few unique features of this condition are the eventual presence of symptoms while sleeping and (for those with pharyngeal involvement) an obviously unilateral presentation. Physical examination will be normal in between episodes. Examination during an episode is difficult because the patients are in extremis. A number of special tests have been investigated.\n\n[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the brainstem where the vagus nerve exits and crosses the cisternal space to the [[jugular foramen]] can be visualized using special sequences such as FIESTA and CISS. Similar to the other neurovascular compression syndromes, standard MRI sequences (e.g. T1- and T2-weighted) do not have the resolution require to see neurovascular compression. In a study to estimate the incidence of a vessel contacting the vagus nerve<ref> Avecillas-Chasin J et al. \u201cImaging and surgical findings in patients with hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm and the potential role of MRI in the diagnostic work-up.\u201d Am J Neuroradiol (2018) doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A5851 </ref> ], 50% of the normal population was found to have a vessel touching or distorting the vagus nerve. This suggests that MRI has too low a specificity to be used for the definitive diagnosis of HELPS. Instead, a \u2018positive\u2019 MRI is necessary but not sufficient for the diagnosis of HELPS. Patients without a vessel compressing their vagus nerve should prompt investigation for an alternative cause of their symptoms (see Differential Diagnosis).\n\nVideo [[laryngoscopy]] usually shows no abnormality in between episodes. Two patients, however, had a unique abnormality of their vocal cords<ref>8.\tHu A et al. \u201cHemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm (HeLPS): defining a new clinical entity\u201d submitted </ref> with a unilateral twitch-like contraction following vocalization. This unilateral movement has not been previously described and may be a rare but pathognomonic phenonium. Video laryngoscopy has not been reported during a choking episode, but it may be very difficult because patients are in extremis.\n\nLaryngeal [[electromyography]] (EMG) has not been conducted in a patient with HeLPS. It is expected the findings would be normal in between episodes and very difficult to perform during a severe bout of choking and coughing.\n\nThe response to unilateral injection of Botulinum toxin (Botox) in the vocal fold has been suggested to be the definitive test of choice. <ref>8.\tHu A et al. \u201cHemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm (HeLPS): defining a new clinical entity\u201d submitted </ref> Botox has been used for the symptomatic treatment of hemifacial spasm because it reduces the facial contractions by weakening the affected muscles. In a similar fashion, Botox in the affected muscles of the throat can reduce the severity of the choking episodes in HeLPS. It does not have any effect on the coughing because the sensory symptoms continue. The beneficial effect typically lasts three months and needs to be repeated. Botox injection in the contralateral side has no benefit (like hemifacial spasm). This unilateral beneficial effect of Botox is unique to HeLPS. Patients with vocal fold dysfunction, paroxysmal vocal fold motion, or irritable larynx all obtain benefit from Botox injections regardless of the side since they are symmetric conditions.\n\n===Diagnostic Protocol===\nPatients with symptoms compatible with HeLPS have either obvious unilateral throat contractions when the pharynx is involved or non-lateralized throat contractions when the larynx is involved. Those with clinically obvious lateralized contractions can be managed with ipsilateral Botox injection in the affected muscles. An MRI should be ordered to confirm the presence of a vessel juxtaposed to the ipsilateral vagus nerve. Patients with clinically non-lateralized contractions should have Botox injected on one side of the throat and then, when the effect has worn off, Botox should be injected on the opposite side. A unilateral benefit should prompt an MRI to look for a vessel juxtaposed to the vagus nerve on the side that Botox was effective.\n\n===Differential Diagnosis===\nCoughing and choking are common symptoms. They can be caused by many conditions including irritants in the air, reactive airway disease, acid reflux, and psychological conditions. <ref>Altman KW et al. \u201cParadoxical vocal fold motion: presentation and treatment options.\u201d J Voice (2000) 14:99-103</ref> The resultant medical conditions have many different names <ref> Christensen PM et al. \u201cERS/ELS/ACCP 2013 international consensus conference nomenclature on inducible laryngeal obstructions.\u201d Eur Respir Rev (2015) 24:445-450</ref> including vocal cord dysfunction, paroxysmal vocal fold motion, irritable larynx. Patients are often treated by laryngologists. Treatments can include avoidance of irritants, proton pump inhibitors, speech therapy and psychological therapy. <ref> Altman KW et al. \u201cParadoxical vocal fold motion: presentation and treatment options.\u201d J Voice (2000) 14:99-103</ref> Patients with similar symptoms may have been described before in the surgical literature. <ref>Patton H et al. \u201cParadoxic vocal cord syndrome with surgical cure.\u201d South Med J (1987) 80:256-258</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n===Medical===\nThe choking episodes can be eased with Botox injections in the appropriate muscles. The sensory symptoms may respond to anti-epileptic medications. Confirmation of the diagnosis may ease the associated psychological stress commonly found in patients with HeLPS.\n\n===Surgical===\nLike other neurovascular compression syndromes, HeLPS can be ameliorated or cured with decompression of the affected nerve. The surgery to accomplish this is called microvascular decompression (MVD) of the vagus nerve. \n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe prevalence and incidence of HeLPS is unknown. It may be similar to glossopharyngeal neuralgia at approximately 1 per 1,000,000 per year.\n\n==History==\nThe first patient with HELPS was reported in 2017.<ref>Honey et al. \u201cEpisodic hemilaryngpharyngeal spasm (HELPS) syndrome: case report of a surgically treatable novel neuropathy.\u201d J Neurosurg (2017) 126:1653-1656</ref> That single case report focused on the similarity of the motor symptoms between hemifacial spasm and hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm. Both conditions have unilateral involuntary motor contractions that are episodic, progressive, can occur while sleeping, can be ameliorated with Botox, and cured by MVD. The patient also had episodic coughing which was not described in detail because it was not realized to be a fundamental part of the syndrome until more patients were studied. The original microscope images and video of the case were lost when the Pentero microscope was upgraded before the data was transferred. Ms. Vicky Earle provided profession illustrations of the anatomy for the publication. \n\nThe name of this condition was originally going to be called episodic hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm. This was adjusted to hemi episodic laryngopharyngeal spasm to provide the more memorable acronym HELPS. There was some resultant confusion was to what \u2018hemi episodic\u2019 meant. The similar condition of hemifacial spasm is also episodic but does not use the adjective \u2018episodic\u2019. The name was therefore altered slightly to just hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm omitting the word \u2018episodic\u2019. The acronym was then also adjusted to HeLPS with the \u2018He\u2019 referring to \u2018hemi\u2019. \n\nThe first case series was reported in 2018. <ref>Honey et al. \u201cHemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm as a novel cause of inducible laryngeal obstruction with a surgical cure: report of 3 cases.\u201d J Neurosurg (2018) doi: 10.3171/2018.2JNS172952</ref> With the addition of several patients, the core symptoms became clearer. All patients had severe, episodic choking and coughing. Some patients also had episodic vocal changes presumably due to contraction of the laryngeal musculature. Some patients had sensations of a \u2018fat\u2019 tongue (e.g. patient 1) presumably on the basis of contraction of the palatoglossus muscle. Some patients could feel what side of their throat was contracting (presumably due to pharyngeal muscle contractions) and some patients could not lateralize the circumferential choking (presumably due to laryngeal muscle contraction).\n\nThe etiology of unconsciousness in some patients was raised in an editorial <ref>Kaufmann AM \u201cEditorial. Considering a neurovascular compression etiology.\u201d J Neurosurg (2018) doi: 10.3171/2018.3.JNS18385 </ref> that was published with the case series. The universal association of unconsciousness with severe coughing and the time course of unconsciousness \u2013 a slow fading out rather than a sudden loss - suggests that the etiology of unconsciousness may be \u2018cough syncope\u2019 not cardiac arrythmia or hypoxia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Neurological disorders]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Please do not remove or change this AfD message until the discussion has been closed. -->\n{{Article for deletion/dated|page=Hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm|timestamp=20200411164601|year=2020|month=April|day=11|substed=yes|help=off}}\n<!-- Once discussion is closed, please place on talk page: {{Old AfD multi|page=Hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm|date=11 April 2020|result='''keep'''}} -->\n<!-- End of AfD message, feel free to edit beyond this point -->\n{{Infobox medical condition\n |name          = \n |synonym       = \n |image         = \n |image_size    = \n |alt           = \n |caption       = \n |pronounce     = \n |specialty     = neurology\n |symptoms      = \n |complications = \n |onset         = \n |duration      = \n |types         = \n |causes        = \n |risks         = \n |diagnosis     = \n |differential  = \n |prevention    = \n |treatment     = \n |medication    = \n |prognosis     = \n |frequency     = \n |deaths        = \n}}\n'''Hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm''' or HeLPS is a neurological condition with symptoms of episodic severe coughing and choking due to a unilateral compression of the [[vagus nerve]].<ref> Honey et al. \u201cEpisodic hemilaryngpharyngeal spasm (HELPS) syndrome: case report of a surgically treatable novel neuropathy.\u201d J Neurosurg (2017) 126:1653-1656 </ref><ref> Honey et al. \u201cHemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm as a novel cause of inducible laryngeal obstruction with a surgical cure: report of 3 cases.\u201d J Neurosurg (2018) doi: 10.3171/2018.2JNS172952 </ref> It is one of the neurovascular compression syndromes.  \n\nCompression of the [[trigeminal nerve]] can cause [[trigeminal neuralgia]], compression of the facial nerve can cause [[hemifacial spasm]], and compression of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] can cause glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Compression of the vagus nerve can cause hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm. \n\n==Signs and Symptoms==\nPatients with HeLPS describe a recognizable pattern of symptoms that include episodic choking and coughing. The choking is due to a unilateral contraction of the throat. If the contraction is in the [[pharynx]], the patient will typically be able to detect which side of the throat is affected. Even a bystander may be able to feel that the muscles on one side of the throat are in spasm. If the [[larynx]] is affected, however, the patient may not be able to feel which side is affected but will report a circumferential choking. These choking episodes tend to worsen over the years in intensity, frequency and duration. Initially, episodes last for a few seconds but can eventually progress to several minutes. The throat contraction can make breathing difficult causing [[stridor]] (not [[wheezing]]) and the patient have reported losing consciousness. Like hemifacial spasm, HeLPS is one of the very few movement disorders that can occur while sleeping. The unpredictable but inevitable choking episodes typically cause significant anxiety for the patient and may lead to a psychiatric misdiagnosis. The choking episodes can lead to intubation in the emergency room and rarely to elective [[tracheostomy]]. In between episodes, patients are normal. Repeated episodes of spontaneous severe choking followed shortly afterwards by a completely normal examination may also increase the likelihood of a psychiatric misdiagnosis. Patients have described different triggers for these choking episodes including loud or prolonged talking, and exercise but they can also occur spontaneously. \n\nThe coughing episodes are also episodic, progressively severe and eventually nocturnal. They are initiated by a \u201cticking sensation\u201d deep in the throat or more typically behind the [[suprasternal notch]]. This sensation then causes the patient to cough. The cough is therefore a \u2018normal\u2019 response to this ticking sensation rather than an uncontrolled muscular contraction of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] or [[intercostal muscles]]. The coughing episodes can be severe with [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], vomiting, visual [[phosphenes]] (\u201cseeing stars\u201d), and post-tussive headache. These episodes typically progress from mild to severe over the years and eventually will awaken the patient from sleep. In between episodes, the patient is normal and respiratory examination does not reveal reactive airways disease (asthma) or allergies. The coughing episodes can be triggered by loud or prolonged talking, exercise or the choking episodes described above.\n\nSome, but not all, patients also describe episodic changes in their voice. This may be due to unilateral contractions in the muscles controlling the vocal cords. One patient reported that this could be triggered by loud or prolonged talking and would typically last a few minutes. If the episode was mild, their voice would return to normal within a few minutes. If the episode was severe, it would progress into severe choking. Two patients also reported a sensation that their tongue was \u201cfat\u201d during the choking episodes. This may be due to contraction of the [[palatoglossus muscle]]. The combination of choking and a sensation of a \u201cfat\u201d tongue may lead to a misdiagnosis of an allergic reaction.\n\nPatients do not report pain during an episode. This is not glossopharyngeal neuralgia although the condition can co-exist with HeLPS (see below). None of the patients have reported sudden loss of consciousness or [[cardiac arrythmias]] as is rarely seen in some cases of glossopharyngeal neuralgia (so called vago-glossopharyngeal neuralgia). None of the patients have reported gastrointestinal parasympathetic symptomatology such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. There is one case report in the literature with a patient reporting episodic diarrhea and abdominal pain that was cured following microvascular decompression of the vagus nerve.<ref> Antherieu P et al. \u201cVagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia revealed through predominant digestive vagal manifestations.

The history of symptoms will be reported by the patient and should match the descriptions provided above. A few unique features of this condition are the eventual presence of symptoms while sleeping and (for those with pharyngeal involvement) an obviously unilateral presentation. Physical examination will be normal in between episodes. Examination during an episode is difficult because the patients are in extremis.

Similar to the other neurovascular compression syndromes, standard MRI sequences (e.g. T1- and T2-weighted) do not have the resolution require to see neurovascular compression. In a study to estimate the incidence of a vessel contacting the vagus nerve<ref> Avecillas-Chasin J et al. \u201cImaging and surgical findings in patients with hemi-laryngopharyngeal spasm and the potential role of MRI in the diagnostic work-up.\u201d Am J Neuroradiol (2018) doi: 10.3174/ajnr.A5851 </ref> ], 50% of the normal population was found to have a vessel touching or distorting the vagus nerve.

Some patients could feel what side of their throat was contracting (presumably due to pharyngeal muscle contractions) and some patients could not lateralize the circumferential choking (presumably due to laryngeal muscle contraction).\n\nThe etiology of unconsciousness in some patients was raised in an editorial <ref>Kaufmann AM \u201cEditorial. Considering a neurovascular compression etiology.\u201d J Neurosurg (2018) doi: 10.3171/2018.3.JNS18385 </ref> that was published with the case series. The universal association of unconsciousness with severe coughing and the time course of unconsciousness \u2013 a slow fading out rather than a sudden loss - suggests that the etiology of unconsciousness may be \u2018cough syncope\u2019 not cardiac arrythmia or hypoxia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Neurological disorders]]\n", "name_user": "Drcrhoney", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemi-laryngopharyngeal_spasm"}
