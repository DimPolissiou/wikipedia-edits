A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in [[Beijing]] who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

[[pneumonia]] cases in [[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei|Hubei Province]], China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.

Jetfire's dedication to the Autobot cause is matched only by his devotion to scientific and technological advancement&nbsp;\u2014 this, he believes, is the only way in which victory over the Decepticons can be achieved. It is this overriding belief that tempers his bravado in battle, but nevertheless, he is often one of the most eager Autobots to plunge into combat, and his position as one of the fastest usually means he is the first to do so. Jetfire is created from the same mold as the [[VF-1 Valkyrie|VF-1S Super Valkyrie]] from the ''[[Macross]]'' series (see [[#Toys|Toys]]), including the VF-1S's [[gunpod]], which is described as a laser on Jetfire's technical specifications.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised & Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 31}}</ref> He uses a photon missile launcher in robot mode.\n\n===Animated series===\n''In the animated series, Jetfire was called '''Skyfire''', for reasons discussed below.''\n\nOn Cybertron before the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, Skyfire was a scientist and explorer working with [[Starscream]]. Together, they investigated an uncharted planet, actually a prehistoric Earth, where they failed to find any signs of intelligent life. Skyfire wished to scrutinize the planet further, and moving in close enough to the planet, a polar wind storm swept him up and buried him beneath the Arctic ice. Starscream searched for his friend, but was unable to locate him and returned to Cybertron alone.\n\nMillions of years later, in 1984, the Decepticons excavated the frozen Skyfire while draining heat energy from the Earth's core and reactivated him. Reunited with his old friend, Starscream, Skyfire joined the Decepticon ranks. When the Autobots arrived, Skyfire engaged them in battle, and then rescued Sparkplug and Spike Witwicky when they became stranded on an ice floe. Unknowingly, he took the two to [[Megatron]] under the impression that he and the other Decepticons valued human life, but when Megatron took them as prisoners, Skyfire started to question his allegiance. When Starscream ordered him to destroy the captured Autobot search party, he refused, and Starscream turned his weapons on him, leaving him heavily damaged. Repaired by Ratchet, he joined the Autobots and engaged in a dogfight with Starscream which ended when he sacrificed himself to stop the core drain, burying himself in ice once again in the process.\n\nA short time later, however, Skyfire was recovered by Wheeljack and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], and immediately participated in an attack on the Decepticons in [[Peru]], where the evil robots were once again attempting to use the Earth's core energy for their own means. Skyfire was almost permitted to destroy the villains' new weapon by [[Thundercracker]], but was then blasted by Starscream (who attempted to blast Thundercracker) and repaired with some difficulty by Spike.\n\nSkyfire would go on to make semi-regular appearances in the immediate future, helping the Autobots evacuate their base when the volcano it was embedded in became active, and flying a squad of troops to battle the [[Insecticons]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |title=Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003 |publisher=Anime.com |accessdate=2010-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119132401/http://anime.com/Transformers/ |archivedate=2010-11-19 }}</ref> Skyfire appeared in a few more episodes, but disappeared from the cartoon due to legal issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Jetfire_(G1)#Why_.22Skyfire.22.3F|title=Jetfire (G1) - Transformers Wiki|website=tfwiki.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref>\n\nSkyfires animation model made infrequent appearances in the third season, making its final appearance in \"Dark Awakening\" being shot down by [[Quintessons]] in a space battle.\n\n===Books===\n[[File:skyfire-satellite.jpg|right|thumb|Skyfire attacks the Satellite of Doom.]]\nSkyfire was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure ''[[List of Transformers books#Satellite of Doom|Satellite of Doom]]''. His appearance matched his animated form, not the toy. During the story Skyfire is killed.\n\nSkyfire appeared in the audio and book adventure ''When Continents Collide''.\n\n===Comics===\n====Devil's Due Publishing====\n[[File:jetfire-dd.jpg|right|thumb|Jetfire and the G.I. Joes]]\nJetfire would also appear in the third G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover from [[Devil's Due Publishing]]. He was present with the other Autobots at the Capital City peace celebrations, battling Reflector, but was ordered off by [[Optimus Prime]]. He was later seen as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime.\n\n====Dreamwave Productions====\nIn [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]]'s 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 universe, Jetfire was once again presented as Starscream friend before the Great War started. As the war broke out, Jetfire was slow to choose an allegiance, eventually siding with the Autobots. Despite the fact that he even remained with the Autobots when Optimus Prime and Megatron vanished in an early space bridge experiment and the factions splintered into smaller sub-groups, his original hesitance caused his Autobot allies to regard him with a certain degree of mistrust. Grimlock in particular bore a fierce grudge against him for an unspecified incident involving a mind-controlling cerebro-shell, and was perfectly ready to believe that he had betrayed the Autobots when he arranged a meeting with current Decepticon leader Shockwave. Jetfire was among the Transformers kidnapped by the ancient Cybertronian called the Fallen, who planned to use the genetic potential in his spark to awaken Primus, but he was freed by [[Grimlock]], putting the grudge to rest.\n\nPrime and Megatron subsequently returned to Cybertron, but when they and their elite crews were lost aboard the Ark, Jetfire was part of a mission to find them, along with [[Omega Supreme]] and the [[Micromasters]] Countdown and Groundshaker. When a lead emerged in the form of a beacon from the Sol system was detected, Jetfire and Omega split off from the team (who went on to investigate Decepticon attacks on other planets) and headed off after the signal. The duo entered stasis for the lengthy trip, with Jetfire eventually awakening millions of years later as their craft approached Earth. Before Jetfire could bring Omega back on-line, however, their ship was attacked by [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and crashed in the Arctic, where shrapnel from it killed a pod of whales. Jetfire ejected from the ship before impact and managed to seal Scourge in a booby-trapped stasis pod, but an avalanche buried both of them in ice.\n\nAt an ill-defined point in time, the Decepticons discovered Jetfire and brought the slab of ice containing him back to their underwater base. Upon returning from a trip to Cybertron with fresh plans of conquest, Starscream thawed Jetfire out to aid in repelling the maniacal [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]], a clone of himself that [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had created, but which had gone insane. Deducing Sunstorm's clone nature, Jetfire jury-rigged a power siphon to de-energise him, and then reactivated Omega Supreme to battle him. To save his own skin from Autobot retribution, however, Starscream had a change of heart and saved Sunstorm, who led him to a mysterious underground energy reservoir that Sunstorm intended to use to give Starscream powers like his own. Yet another double-cross by Starscream saw Sunstorm immersed in the liquid as well, and it began to destroy him from within as Jetfire engaged him in battle, leading him out into space where he exploded, apparently taking Jetfire with him.\n\n====Fun Publications====\n=====Classicverse=====\nIn the [[Fun Publications]] ''Classicverse'' stories Optimus Prime has returned to Earth commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], Jetfire, [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]] (formerly Hot Rod).\n\nIn the story ''Crossing Over'', Jetfire was among Autobot troops of Optimus Prime who responded to the sighting of Megatron and arrived in time to save the dimensional traveling Autobot Skyfall from Megatron's wraith.\n\nIn ''At Fight's End'', Dirge, Ramjet and Thrust under the orders of Megatron. The city was defended by Ironhide, Jetfire, Optimus Prime and [[Sunstreaker]].<ref>{{cite comic |colorist= |date=December 2009/January 2010 |editor=Pete Sinclair |inker= |issue=30 | letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Evan Gauntt |publisher=Fun Publications |story=At Fight's End |title=Hasbro Transformers Collectors' Club The Official Magazine | volume=1 |writer=Pete Sinclair}}</ref>\n\n====IDW Publishing====\nJetfire was presented as a technician and computer expert, who ran field ops during the battle of Thunderhead Pass trying to find a weakness in Thunderwing that could allow the Autobot-Decepticon army to defeat him. Many years later, he and the [[Technobots]] served as a scientific surveillance team orbiting a devastated Cybertron, monitoring it for any signs of life. The discovery of an energy spike caused Jetfire to lead the team down to the planet, where they were assaulted and captured by a team of Decepticon cultists who worshipped Thunderwing. Once freed by Optimus Prime and the [[The Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], his skills at decrypting Bludgeon's computer files uncovered an exploitable weakness in Thunderwing's new power-source, allowing Prime to eventually defeat him, and uncovered [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s Energon-seeding plan Regenesis. His appearance is based on the recent redesign of the character seen in Transformers Classics toy line. He was also mentioned in ''Transformers: Escalation'' during a communication between Optimus Prime and him.\n\n====Marvel Comics====\n[[File:Csjetfire5.jpg|left|thumb|Jetfire receives the Autobrand]]\nJetfire was constructed by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] on Earth to be one of his new Decepticon troops, given life through the powers of the [[Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]], tapped from the captive Autobot leader, [[Optimus Prime]]. However, before Shockwave could accomplish this, Prime transferred the Matrix into the mind of the Autobots' human ally, Buster Witwicky. Shockwave programmed Jetfire's lifeless shell to recover Buster, but Buster was able to use the Matrix to disassemble Jetfire before he could accomplish his goal. Buster then reconstructed Jetfire and used him to rescue Optimus Prime, who infused Jetfire with true life.\n\nImmediately after this&nbsp;\u2014 in the UK's sister ''Transformers'' comic series, which interspliced its own original material between reprints of the US Marvel title&nbsp;\u2014 Jetfire participated in the \"Dinobot Hunt\", helping to track down the rogue Dinobots, who were running wild across America. Still bearing the Decepticon insignia Shockwave had stamped him with, Jetfire was not trusted by Ironhide until he saved him from the deranged Slag, proving his Autobot loyalty.\n\nSubsequently, in the US title, he underwent the Rite of Autobrand and was branded with the Autobot insignia at last.\n\nJetfire went on to perform few significant actions in the future (although he did serve as the Autobots' acting leader against [[Galvatron]] in the ''[[Target:2006]]'' storyline), but was clearly thoroughly accepted into the Autobots, as his was one of the small number of voices heard when a new Autobot leader had to be chosen, and Dinobot leader [[Grimlock]] was elected.\n\nA story called ''The Gift'' in issue 93 of the Marvel UK comics explored Jetfire's problems fitting in with the other Autobots. Wheeljack informed [[Optimus Prime]] of a news cast where they learned the Decepticons had taken over a [[NASA]] space monitoring facility near the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Trailbreaker]], with Jetfire as backup engaged the Decepticons [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], Kickback and Dirge as the Decepticons attempted to contact Cybertron with the facility's deep space radio equipment. Although Prowl ordered Jetfire to stop Soundwave from sending his message, Jetfire ignored the order to help save Prowl from Kickback's attack. With the transmission sent the Decepticons retreated victorious. Jetfire then accompanied [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] to a [[G. B. Blackrock|Blackrock]] fuel plant to oversee the creation of more fuel for the Autobots. The plant was attacked by Decepticons Thrust and Bombshell. Although Jetfire was able to put out a fire at the plant before it exploded, he blamed himself for being slow to react. Jetfire then visited Buster Witwicky on [[Christmas Eve]] and tell him of his troubles of not fitting in with the Cybertronian-made Autobots. Buster encouraged the young Autobot by telling him he's the first of a new generation of Earth-made Autobots and he should be proud of what he is.\n\nIn issue #27 (US), \"King of the Hill!\", [[Perceptor]] summoned his fellow Autobots [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]], Jetfire, [[Omega Supreme]], Ratchet and [[Silverbolt]] in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon [[Trypticon]] the leader was chosen - [[Grimlock]].\n\nSometime later, Jetfire was among the Transformers who attempted to defend [[New York City]] from the cosmically-powered Starscream, only to be deactivated alongside everyone else. Unlike most of Starscream's victims, there was no indication that he was revived through the power of nucleon.\n\n===Games===\nThe ''Robots in Disgise'' Classic line appeared in a simple [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based video game on the Hasbro web site called ''Transformers Battle Circuit''.

This led to problems for Takara when they imported the Transformers toyline&nbsp;\u2014 although Hasbro was able to market the Jetfire toy in their markets, [[Takara]] was not, nor could they promote it via the animated series, since the mold was owned by their main competitor, and therefore, it was viewed as potential free advertising for Takatoku (this issue also prevented the Deluxe Vehicles, Deluxe Insecticons, [[Omega Supreme]], and Sky Lynx from being released in Japan, though after Takara merged with [[Tomy]], the latter two were finally released in Japan). Although an animation model had been created for Jetfire based on the appearance of the toy (which could be seen in the original toy commercial advertising the figure), this was quickly abandoned and completely redesigned so as to no longer resemble the Valkyrie. This was the design that went on to feature in the comics and cartoons.\n:Jetfire only saw a few American production runs, as the show the original toy was based upon, ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', was exported to America to become the first third of ''[[Robotech]]''. Ironically, since Hasbro released Jetfire first, there was never a U.S. release of an authentic transforming version of the toy for ''Robotech'', even though the design was the series' most recognizable and popular mecha. As with other pre-''Robotech'' borrowings from ''Macross'' (for instance, ''[[BattleTech]]''), the licensing situation for the toy became murky with two different companies ([[Big West Advertising|Big West]] and [[Tatsunoko Production]]) asserting exclusive rights to license ''Macross'' merchandise outside Japan. Due to these legal issues, Jetfire has not been among the Transformers toys reissued in the 21st century, instead being offered as part of the War For Cybertron: Siege toyline in his cartoon/comic design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=oQ8-AAAAEBAJ|title= Changeable robot toy&nbsp;\u2014 Google Patent Search|publisher=google|accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>\n:This toy is patented in the U.S. as patent number D287037.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD287037S/en|title=Changeable robot toy|author=|date=|website=google.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n* '''''Generation 2'' Cyberjet Jetfire''' (1995)\n:The first new Jetfire in a decade was a member of the [[Cyberjets]], highly poseable, ball-jointed jets with pressure-activated launching missiles. A repaint of the Decepticon figure released at the same time named Hooligan -- and consequently erroneously decorated with Decepticon symbols -- this figure bore some physical resemblance to his original (unarmored) self, although his color scheme and missile launcher arm drew attention away from his familiar shape. His tech spec bio made it clear that this was still the same Jetfire as before. Cyberjet Jetfire could be partially transformed into a forward-kneed \"gerwalk\" mode, but his rear wings and tail made the figure too top-heavy to stand upright for very long.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future | last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books | ISBN=1-57243-983-1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/transformersfant00erin/page/22 22] | url=https://archive.org/details/transformersfant00erin/page/22 }}</ref>\n* '''''Robot Masters'' R-Blade''' (2004)\n:Cyberjet Jetfire figure was redecoed in 2004 for the Japanese-exclusive ''Transformers: Robot Masters'' toyline as ''R-Blade'', in a red, white and black color scheme that was a direct homage to the original Jetfire. The bio of this figure specifically noted that Jetfire was the leader of the Cyberjets, although the original figure's bio made no mention of it. R-Blade comes with the missile weapon as a ''sonic lance'' and a ''flare gun''.\n* '''''Titanium'' 6&nbsp;inch Jetfire''' (2006)\n:Released in the second wave of the die-cast metal ''Transformers: Titanium'' line, this 6\" version of Jetfire is based on his Cybertronian mode from Dreamwave's ''[[Transformers: The War Within|War Within]]'' comic book series.\n* '''''Classics'' Voyager Jetfire''' (2007)\n:Part of the second wave of releases for the ''Transformers Classics'' toy line, this incarnation of Jetfire has a removable booster pack and helmet; with them attached (and excluding the translucent blue missiles), the toy looks much like the ''Macross'' (Super) Valkyrie-based original. Without them, he is closer to Skyfire's appearance on the Generation 1 cartoon. His double-barreled rifle was also made to resemble Skyfire's weapon from the cartoon. Some fans have also found a sort of \"hidden\" mode with the Classics figure. Due to the toy's unusual hip design, it can be configured into a Gerwalk-like mode, although no official public documentation by Hasbro, on the website or instruction sheet, specifies this. Without armor, Jetfire's vehicle mode resembles an [[F-14 Tomcat]], with exhaust design elements inspired by the [[F-22 Raptor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oafe.net/yo/tfcl_jf.php |title=Transformers Classics: Jetfire review |publisher=OAFE |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:A printing error on the back of the Classic Grimlock box used Jetfire's picture as one of his co-sells, but listed him as the Decepticon Astrotrain.\n:This toy was remolded into the [[BotCon]] 2007 exclusive Timelines Dreadwind and the 2008 ''Universe'' Series Tread Bolt.\n\n[[File:Su-27 low pass.jpg|right|thumb|The SU-27 Flanker]]\n* '''''Classics'' Legends Jetfire''' (2007)\n:First seen at Botcon 2006, the Legends Jetfire is a repaint of ''Cybertron'' Legends [[Thundercracker]] in the traditional colors of Jetfire.<ref>{{cite web|author=TFormers.com |url=http://tformers.com/ig.php?mode=view&album=6593&pic=IMG_3503.jpg&dispsize=800&start=20 |title=Photo of Micro Jetfire at Botcon 2006 |publisher=Tformers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:This version of Jetfire turns into an SU-27 Flanker jet.\n* '''''Henkei!

The friendly nature that keeps him popular amongst the Autobots hides a strong sense of intelligent judgment that has saved his team from numerous predicaments, and means that he will even speak up and tell Prime that he is wrong to his face.\n\n===Animated series===\n====''Transformers: Armada''====\nIn this series, he is very boastful. When Optimus Prime led a small force to Earth to investigate the [[Mini-Con]] signal emanating from that world, Jetfire was left in charge on Cybertron, but eventually later departed the planet to join his commander on Earth. Arriving shortly after the Decepticon tactician Thrust, Jetfire scanned an Earthen space shuttle upon approach to the planet and burst onto the scene in the middle of a battle, his energetic and unexpected arrival completely throwing off Thrust's meticulous plan and allowing the Autobots to claim victory. When Thrust arranged the next Decepticon attack on the Autobots, Jetfire once again proved to be the monkey wrench in his plan when he and Optimus Prime revealed their ability to combine together, once again foiling the villain's schemes. Although, Optimus Prime said \"Jet Convoy\" the first time they combined, later in the series he referred to it as Jet Optimus.\n\nJetfire's unique space-flight abilities make him a distinct asset to the Autobot forces, allowing them to recover a Mini-Con from [[Mars]]. He journeys there together with [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]] who had joined the Autobots at that time. Jetfire is displeased that the turncoat Decepticon will keep his company, but he cannot do anything about it, for Starscream simply takes off the first and leaves him behind. So Jetfire has the only alternative to follow \"this brainless robot\" reluctantly. On the way to Mars, however, he loses sight of Starscream and finds him only with the aid of the [[Star Saber|Air Defense Mini-Con Team]]. He invites Starscream to look for the Mini-Con together, but the latter refuses. Then Jetfire arrests and shackles Starscream for insubordination. While Jetfire towes his prisoner back to Earth, Megatron and Tidal Wave attack them. But, in spite of their disagreement, Jetfire and Starscream prove to be capable of acting as a team. So they succeed in resisting the enemy and in rescuing the Mini-Con.\n\nIt is noteworthy that after Starscream refuses his help, though being seriously damaged, Jetfire remarks that he is \"stubborn as usual\"; supposedly, he had already got to know Starscream's nature well enough.\n\nWhen Optimus Prime dies at the hands of the Decepticon super-weapon, the Hydra Cannon, Jetfire steps down to allow [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] to assume command, retaining his secondary position even when Prime was returned to life by the power of the Mini-Cons. Jetfire goes on to participate in the \"Unicron Battles,\" when the planet-eating giant robot [[Unicron]] attacks Cybertron, and returns the Autobots' human allies Rad, Carlos and Alexis to Earth after the battle is won.\n\n====''Transformers: Energon''====\nOver the ensuing decade, Jetfire (now called '''Skyfire''' in Japan) received an upgrade into a new body-form, and received the Spark of Combination from Primus, allowing him to combine with other Autobots, most frequently the rookie trooper Ironhide, who he had to carefully train and walk through the combination process. Despite his external changes, however, Jetfire remained consistent in personality and outlook, always ready with a witty remark to keep the mood light even in the middle of a pitched battle. He is once again, the second-in-command of the Autobots.\n\nWhen the resurrected Unicron came under the control of [[Megatron]], Primus used his powers to permanently super-charge some of the Autobots, Jetfire included, recoloring their armor. The resultant battle saw Unicron's body destroyed, but his spark endured and possessed Megatron&nbsp;\u2014 now [[Galvatron]] - who grew to colossal size. In order to combat the giant villain, Jetfire and the Autobots took their Spark of Combination to the ultimate extreme, transforming their bodies into pure energy and merging with Optimus Prime, enlarging him to similar proportions and allowing him to battle Galvatron directly. Ironically it was Galvatron who was ultimately the instrument of Unicron's defeat when he plunged himself into an energon sun created by Primus in order to stop Unicron from taking over his body permanently.\n\n====''Transformers: Cybertron''====\nIn order to recuperate after the stresses of the final battle against Unicron, Jetfire ('''Dreadrock''' in Japan, a new character there, not the same as the Jetfire from ''Superlink'', but is still the Autobot's second-in-command)<ref>{{Cite journal | author = | title = Transformers - Galaxy Force Secret Special DVD!| journal = TV Magazine| volume = | issue = | pages= |date = February 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvsjngLBR54}}</ref> took some time out to vacation of the planet of Nebulos, where he inadvertently picked up the local accent (resembling Earthen [[Australia]]n). His relaxation was brought to an end, however, when Primus's energon sun collapsed in on itself, forming a gigantic black hole that threatened the safety of Cybertron.\n\nReturning to the planet, Jetfire helped the Autobots there evacuate, relocating once more to Earth, where he suggested the Autobots revisit the idea of taking on Earthly vehicle alternate modes to hide themselves from the populace, adopting for himself a new cargo plane alternate mode. He went on to develop a rivalry with Decepticon [[Thundercracker]] over who was the superior flyer. Jetfire was Optimus Prime's second-in-command in this series, and was rather cocky. Jetfire participated in many of the battles on Earth, Cybertron and Giant Planet.\n\nIn the episode \"Warp\", It is revealed that he has a fear of needles ([[trypanophobia]]).\n\nIn the episode \"Unfinished\", when the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Animatros back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The jungle planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], the Autobots, the former Decepticons, and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.\n\nAfter the threat of the black hole was thwarted, he was appointed leader of Cybertron in Optimus Prime's absence.\n\nJetfire wields two guns, and is able to generate twin whirlwinds from his shoulders. His Earth-type Cyber Key activates twin missiles in his back. Later, the Jetfire toy was repainted as a Decepticon named Sky Shadow. His bio says that Sky Shadow is actually an undercover Jetfire.\n\n===Dreamwave Productions===\n====''Transformers: Energon''====\nOver the following decade, Jetfire retained his position as Autobot second in command through the Autobot/Decepticon alliance. Unicron's threat, however, had not been ended, as was proven when the [[Terrorcon]]s; dissident Decepticons given new powers through Unicron's intermediary agent, [[Alpha Q]]uintesson; attacked the AlterEnergy research facility on Earth and Jetfire, now equipped with the Spark of Combination, joined the other Autobots in defending it and its human occupants.\n\nThe Terrorcon threat underwent sudden, horrific multiplication when they were cloned through Unicron's power, and massive swarms of them assaulted key cities across Earth. Jetfire petitioned the High Council to allow more troops and energon to be dedicated to Earth, and it was only through the efforts of council member Avalon that his appeal was accepted. A large strike force under Jetfire's command was assembled and sent to Earth, with Jetfire taking a portion of the team (Bulkhead, Cliffjumper, Landquake, Perceptor and Tow-Line) to [[Los Angeles]]. Despite fighting a tough battle, it was soon apparent that the Autobots were not going to win, until Megatron; reborn in a vastly powerful new body; came blasting onto the scene and shattered the Terrorcon forces, allowing Autobot victory.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIDW's Transformers Collectors Club exclusive comic story, \"Revelations Part 6\", is set after the defeat of [[Galvatron]] but before Optimus Prime's mission to start a new Space Bridge project. In this story the Autobots from the Fun Publications stories (''Robots in Disguise'' [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]], [[Ultra Magnus]], Sentinel Maximus, [[Downshift (Transformers)|Downshift]], [[Perceptor]], [[Alpha Trion]], Over-Run, [[Anti-Blaze]], [[Checkpoint (Transformers)|Checkpoint]], and [[Scythe (Transformers)|Scythe]]) meet the Autobots from the animated series (''Cybertron'' [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]], Jetfire, Override, [[Scattorshot]], [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]], [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]], [[Lori (Transformers)|Lori]], Bud, and [[Coby Hansen]]) and thank each other and remembering those who were lost in the battles.\n\n===Toys===\n* '''''Armada'' Jetfire with Comettor''' (2002)\n:Jetfire transforms into a space shuttle; the landing gear becomes a shield for his robot mode, while one of the three thrusters becomes a large gun with electronic engine and laser noises. Jetfire is packaged with the Mini-Con '''Comettor''', who transforms into a lunar rover and mounts as landing gear for Jetfire in shuttle mode. When plugged into the gun/thruster, Comettor triggers two spring-loaded tail fins to pop out, and switches the laser noise to a \"5-4-3-2-1\" countdown. When plugged into the shuttle's wings, Comettor causes two bombs to drop, which can also be stored in other inactive slots. Jetfire can also transform into a set of legs, atop which Optimus Prime's super mode torso can attach, forming '''Jet Optimus''' (Jet Convoy in Japan).\n:A special Target store exclusive bonus pack of Armada Jetfire with Commetor came with the Space Team Mini-Cons Payload, Skyblast and Astroscope.\n:According to the ''Transformers Collectors Club'' magazine, the vehicle mode of this Jetfire is inspired by the X-71 Shuttle from the 1998 film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''.\n* {{anchor|Spacewarp}} '''''Armada'' Powerlinx Jetfire with Comettor''' (2003)\n:A blue and white redeco of the ''Armada'' Jetfire figure, representing Jetfire in his enhanced body, as seen in the ''Transformers: Armada'' comic books.\n:A redeco of this mold was intended for release in Transformers: Universe as the Decepticon '''Spacewarp''', but this was canceled. A slightly altered version of this toy was later revived as an exclusive for the Official Transformers Collectors Club, as the classic Decepticon [[Astrotrain]], with a new head sculpt to resemble the character's classic head design.\n* '''''Energon'' Jetfire''' (2004)\n:The new ''Energon'' incarnation of Jetfire features a spring-loaded missile launcher and undercarriage grabber claws. The figure bears a golden Powerlinx symbol, meaning that it can combine with other figures of the same size, forming either a torso or legs to do so. Connecting the figure with another produces an electronic linking noise, while pushing down on Jetfire's head yields a sped-up version of the classic \"transformation\" sound. The toy can also link with smaller silver Powerlinx figures, but the results are disproportionate, and not used in the animated series, comics, or the figure's English instructions.\n* '''''Micron Legends'' Skyfire S''' (2005)\n:Another blue and white Jetfire redeco, this time of the ''Energon'' toy. Released in Japan as \"Skyfire S\" (the \"S\" stands for \"Sonic\"), it represents the character in his upgraded form from the animated series. The toy was also released in Hasbro markets, but as a different character named Overcast, Jetfire's brother.\n* '''''Cybertron'' Ultra Jetfire''' (2005)\n:The new ''Cybertron'' incarnation of Jetfire is armed with twin firing missile launchers, which mount under his wings in plane mode. Pressing on the rear of his tail engines activates an electronic engine noise, while flipping the tail section up changes the noise to a shrill laser blast. Inserting the figure's Earth [[Cyber Planet Key]] into the tail section causes a pair of twin guns to pop up, changing the noise once more, into an explosive blast. The toy features some auto-transforming features&nbsp;\u2014 by snapping the nosecone into the hips during the transformation into robot mode, two small missile cluster launchers are popped out, while straightening the arms at the elbows automatically extends the fists.\n:Like most toys sold in the ''Galaxy Force'' toy line by Takara, then later in the ''Cybertron'' toy line by Hasbro, there are small paint differences between the two versions of the toy. The Hasbro version has a code number on the back of his [[Cyber Key]], while the Takara version has no number on his [[Force Chip]].\n:This toy was recolored into [[Transformers (film)|2007 live-action movie]] [[Jetstorm]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cybertron.ca/boards/showthread.php?t=5632 |title=Canadian Transformers News and Discussion&nbsp;\u2014 You read it here first |publisher=Cybertron.CA |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:This toy stands 19 centimeters tall in robot mode. In the animated series Jetfire is depicted as standing 24 feet (or 732 centimeters) tall. This would make this toy 1/39 scale if you base the toy on the size depicted in the show.\n:A real An-225 has a wing span of 8840 centimeters, while this toy has a wingspan of 27 centimeters, making this toy have a scale of about 1/327 of the real world vehicle.

In 2007 a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toy was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave. All identical to their original releases.\n:This toy stands 8.5 centimeters tall in robot mode. In the animated series, Jetfire is depicted as standing 24 feet (or 732 centimeters) tall. This would make this toy 1/86 scale.\n:Repainted in 2007 as Classic Legends [[Fireflight (Transformers)]].\n* '''''Cybertron'' Ultra Sky Shadow''' (2006)\n:A recolor of the ''Cybertron'' Jetfire figure in tan, black and maroon, this figure represents Jetfire in a Decepticon guise used for under cover missions. The name is a reference to the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' [[Predacon]] Sky Shadow, whose name Jetfire apparently found in the Cybertron Archives&nbsp;\u2014 although quite how he would have found information about an individual from a different continuity is puzzling at best (leading one to believe that the name may actually be a reference to [[Transformers: Energon|Sky Shadow from Transformers Energon]]). Because this recolor was a Hasbro exclusive made after the animated series was already produced in Japan, he did not appear in the television series.\n* '''Transformable Robot Armor Battleplane''' (2007)\n:A Chinese-made unofficial toy based on the Legends of Cybertron Jetfire in a larger size and with slightly different colors.

In the film, he also has a missile launcher. As an emphasis on his old age, he carries a walking stick that transforms into the front landing gear of his jet mode.

[[Jetstorm]] wanted Jetfire to scan a picture of him in front of the recently captured [[Decepticon]] Blitzwing \"for the Femme-bots back home\". He then asked how Sentinel Prime captured Blitzwing. He was later seen with Jetfire trying to make the communicator work. He directed [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] to the Elite Guard flagship's brig, where Sentinel had just captured [[Lugnut (Transformers)|Lugnut]].

He proves to be a valuable asset, and remains behind on Cybertron to aid the Wreckers when the ''Ark'' departs. Despite his valiant efforts, some Autobots-notably Wheeljack-continued to doubt his loyalty and suspected that he was a double-agent for the Decepticons. Jetfire proved his loyalty by joining a mission under Ultra Magnus to rescue [[Alpha Trion]] from Shockwave.\n\n===Games===\nJetfire is one of the playable Autobots in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'', and speaks with an English accent (similar to his film incarnation). In the Decepticon campaign, he starts out as one of [[Starscream#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]]'s partners in charge of guarding the dark energon. He also tries to warn [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]] about the deadly effects of dark energon, but his cries fall on deaf ears, as the Decepticon leader immerses himself in it, becoming more powerful. After that Starscream turns his allegiance to Megatron. Jetfire fled the scene, joining the Autobots. \n\nIn the Autobot campaign, Jetfire joins [[Air Raid (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Air Raid]] and [[Silverbolt#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Silverbolt]] in flying in orbit of Cybertron to take down the armed Decepticon orbital station [[Trypticon#Transformers: Prime|Trypticon]], which is preventing Autobot transport ships from leaving the dying planet. The aerial trio enter Trypticon and destroy his cooling systems and plasma reactor, disabling his main weapon. Unfortunately, the attacks are not enough to disable Trypticon, so they enter his core and destroy his transformation cog, forcing him to revert into his true form. Forced to transform into dinosaur mode, Trypticon sets a course toward the Autobot city of Iacon with the intent of decimating it, but the Autobot trio destroy his flight pack, sending him crashing into the planet. This leaves [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers: Prime|Optimus Prime]] and his ground-based team with the task of finishing off Trypticon before he lays further waste on Iacon.\n\nJetfire is playable in the last level of ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''. The player's mission as Jetfire is to destroy the Decepticon tow cables, and helped Jazz knock Bruticus off the Ark.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* {{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1-4053-0461-8 | page= 41}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[tfwiki:Jetfire (disambiguation)|Jetfire]] at [[tfwiki:Main Page|TFWIKI.Net, the Transformers Wiki]]\n\n{{Transformers}}\n\n[[Category:Transformers characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional aircraft]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fun Publications characters]]\n[[Category:Robot characters in video games]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Articles about multiple fictional characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n'''Jetfire''' is the name of several [[character (arts)|fictional characters]] from the [[Transformers]] franchise.

Jetfire's dedication to the Autobot cause is matched only by his devotion to scientific and technological advancement&nbsp;\u2014 this, he believes, is the only way in which victory over the Decepticons can be achieved. It is this overriding belief that tempers his bravado in battle, but nevertheless, he is often one of the most eager Autobots to plunge into combat, and his position as one of the fastest usually means he is the first to do so. Jetfire is created from the same mold as the [[VF-1 Valkyrie|VF-1S Super Valkyrie]] from the ''[[Macross]]'' series (see [[#Toys|Toys]]), including the VF-1S's [[gunpod]], which is described as a laser on Jetfire's technical specifications.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised & Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 31}}</ref> He uses a photon missile launcher in robot mode.\n\n===Animated series===\n''In the animated series, Jetfire was called '''Skyfire''', for reasons discussed below.''\n\nOn Cybertron before the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, Skyfire was a scientist and explorer working with [[Starscream]]. Together, they investigated an uncharted planet, actually a prehistoric Earth, where they failed to find any signs of intelligent life. Skyfire wished to scrutinize the planet further, and moving in close enough to the planet, a polar wind storm swept him up and buried him beneath the Arctic ice. Starscream searched for his friend, but was unable to locate him and returned to Cybertron alone.\n\nMillions of years later, in 1984, the Decepticons excavated the frozen Skyfire while draining heat energy from the Earth's core and reactivated him. Reunited with his old friend, Starscream, Skyfire joined the Decepticon ranks. When the Autobots arrived, Skyfire engaged them in battle, and then rescued Sparkplug and Spike Witwicky when they became stranded on an ice floe. Unknowingly, he took the two to [[Megatron]] under the impression that he and the other Decepticons valued human life, but when Megatron took them as prisoners, Skyfire started to question his allegiance. When Starscream ordered him to destroy the captured Autobot search party, he refused, and Starscream turned his weapons on him, leaving him heavily damaged. Repaired by Ratchet, he joined the Autobots and engaged in a dogfight with Starscream which ended when he sacrificed himself to stop the core drain, burying himself in ice once again in the process.\n\nA short time later, however, Skyfire was recovered by Wheeljack and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], and immediately participated in an attack on the Decepticons in [[Peru]], where the evil robots were once again attempting to use the Earth's core energy for their own means. Skyfire was almost permitted to destroy the villains' new weapon by [[Thundercracker]], but was then blasted by Starscream (who attempted to blast Thundercracker) and repaired with some difficulty by Spike.\n\nSkyfire would go on to make semi-regular appearances in the immediate future, helping the Autobots evacuate their base when the volcano it was embedded in became active, and flying a squad of troops to battle the [[Insecticons]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |title=Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003 |publisher=Anime.com |accessdate=2010-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119132401/http://anime.com/Transformers/ |archivedate=2010-11-19 }}</ref> Skyfire appeared in a few more episodes, but disappeared from the cartoon due to legal issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Jetfire_(G1)#Why_.22Skyfire.22.3F|title=Jetfire (G1) - Transformers Wiki|website=tfwiki.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref>\n\nSkyfires animation model made infrequent appearances in the third season, making its final appearance in \"Dark Awakening\" being shot down by [[Quintessons]] in a space battle.\n\n===Books===\n[[File:skyfire-satellite.jpg|right|thumb|Skyfire attacks the Satellite of Doom.]]\nSkyfire was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure ''[[List of Transformers books#Satellite of Doom|Satellite of Doom]]''.

He was present with the other Autobots at the Capital City peace celebrations, battling [[Reflector (Transformers)|Reflector]], but was ordered off by [[Optimus Prime]]. He was later seen as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force attempting to rescue Optimus Prime.\n\n====Dreamwave Productions====\nIn [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]]'s 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 universe, Jetfire was once again presented as Starscream friend before the Great War started. As the war broke out, Jetfire was slow to choose an allegiance, eventually siding with the Autobots. Despite the fact that he even remained with the Autobots when Optimus Prime and Megatron vanished in an early space bridge experiment and the factions splintered into smaller sub-groups, his original hesitance caused his Autobot allies to regard him with a certain degree of mistrust. Grimlock in particular bore a fierce grudge against him for an unspecified incident involving a mind-controlling cerebro-shell, and was perfectly ready to believe that he had betrayed the Autobots when he arranged a meeting with current Decepticon leader Shockwave. Jetfire was among the Transformers kidnapped by the ancient Cybertronian called the Fallen, who planned to use the genetic potential in his spark to awaken Primus, but he was freed by [[Grimlock]], putting the grudge to rest.\n\nPrime and Megatron subsequently returned to Cybertron, but when they and their elite crews were lost aboard the Ark, Jetfire was part of a mission to find them, along with [[Omega Supreme]] and the [[Micromasters]] Countdown and Groundshaker. When a lead emerged in the form of a beacon from the Sol system was detected, Jetfire and Omega split off from the team (who went on to investigate Decepticon attacks on other planets) and headed off after the signal. The duo entered stasis for the lengthy trip, with Jetfire eventually awakening millions of years later as their craft approached Earth. Before Jetfire could bring Omega back on-line, however, their ship was attacked by [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and crashed in the Arctic, where shrapnel from it killed a pod of whales. Jetfire ejected from the ship before impact and managed to seal Scourge in a booby-trapped stasis pod, but an avalanche buried both of them in ice.\n\nAt an ill-defined point in time, the Decepticons discovered Jetfire and brought the slab of ice containing him back to their underwater base. Upon returning from a trip to Cybertron with fresh plans of conquest, Starscream thawed Jetfire out to aid in repelling the maniacal [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]], a clone of himself that [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had created, but which had gone insane. Deducing Sunstorm's clone nature, Jetfire jury-rigged a power siphon to de-energise him, and then reactivated Omega Supreme to battle him. To save his own skin from Autobot retribution, however, Starscream had a change of heart and saved Sunstorm, who led him to a mysterious underground energy reservoir that Sunstorm intended to use to give Starscream powers like his own. Yet another double-cross by Starscream saw Sunstorm immersed in the liquid as well, and it began to destroy him from within as Jetfire engaged him in battle, leading him out into space where he exploded, apparently taking Jetfire with him.\n\n====Fun Publications====\n=====Classicverse=====\nIn the [[Fun Publications]] ''Classicverse'' stories Optimus Prime has returned to Earth commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], Jetfire, [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]] (formerly Hot Rod).\n\nIn the story ''Crossing Over'', Jetfire was among Autobot troops of Optimus Prime who responded to the sighting of Megatron and arrived in time to save the dimensional traveling Autobot Skyfall from Megatron's wraith.\n\nIn ''At Fight's End'', [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]] and [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] under the orders of Megatron.

Many years later, he and the [[Technobots]] served as a scientific surveillance team orbiting a devastated Cybertron, monitoring it for any signs of life. The discovery of an energy spike caused Jetfire to lead the team down to the planet, where they were assaulted and captured by a team of Decepticon cultists who worshipped Thunderwing. Once freed by Optimus Prime and the [[The Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], his skills at decrypting Bludgeon's computer files uncovered an exploitable weakness in Thunderwing's new power-source, allowing Prime to eventually defeat him, and uncovered [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s Energon-seeding plan Regenesis. His appearance is based on the recent redesign of the character seen in Transformers Classics toy line. He was also mentioned in ''Transformers: Escalation'' during a communication between Optimus Prime and him.\n\n====Marvel Comics====\n[[File:Csjetfire5.jpg|left|thumb|Jetfire receives the Autobrand]]\nJetfire was constructed by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] on Earth to be one of his new Decepticon troops, given life through the powers of the [[Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]], tapped from the captive Autobot leader, [[Optimus Prime]]. However, before Shockwave could accomplish this, Prime transferred the Matrix into the mind of the Autobots' human ally, Buster Witwicky. Shockwave programmed Jetfire's lifeless shell to recover Buster, but Buster was able to use the Matrix to disassemble Jetfire before he could accomplish his goal. Buster then reconstructed Jetfire and used him to rescue Optimus Prime, who infused Jetfire with true life.\n\nImmediately after this&nbsp;\u2014 in the UK's sister ''Transformers'' comic series, which interspliced its own original material between reprints of the US Marvel title&nbsp;\u2014 Jetfire participated in the \"Dinobot Hunt\", helping to track down the rogue Dinobots, who were running wild across America. Still bearing the Decepticon insignia Shockwave had stamped him with, Jetfire was not trusted by Ironhide until he saved him from the deranged Slag, proving his Autobot loyalty.\n\nSubsequently, in the US title, he underwent the Rite of Autobrand and was branded with the Autobot insignia at last.\n\nJetfire went on to perform few significant actions in the future (although he did serve as the Autobots' acting leader against [[Galvatron]] in the ''[[Target:2006]]'' storyline), but was clearly thoroughly accepted into the Autobots, as his was one of the small number of voices heard when a new Autobot leader had to be chosen, and Dinobot leader [[Grimlock]] was elected.\n\nA story called ''The Gift'' in issue 93 of the Marvel UK comics explored Jetfire's problems fitting in with the other Autobots. Wheeljack informed [[Optimus Prime]] of a news cast where they learned the Decepticons had taken over a [[NASA]] space monitoring facility near the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Trailbreaker]], with Jetfire as backup engaged the Decepticons [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Kickback (Transformers)|Kickback]] and [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]] as the Decepticons attempted to contact Cybertron with the facility's deep space radio equipment. Although Prowl ordered Jetfire to stop Soundwave from sending his message, Jetfire ignored the order to help save Prowl from Kickback's attack. With the transmission sent the Decepticons retreated victorious. Jetfire then accompanied [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] to a [[G. B. Blackrock|Blackrock]] fuel plant to oversee the creation of more fuel for the Autobots. The plant was attacked by Decepticons [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] and Bombshell. Although Jetfire was able to put out a fire at the plant before it exploded, he blamed himself for being slow to react. Jetfire then visited Buster Witwicky on [[Christmas Eve]] and tell him of his troubles of not fitting in with the Cybertronian-made Autobots. Buster encouraged the young Autobot by telling him he's the first of a new generation of Earth-made Autobots and he should be proud of what he is.\n\nIn issue #27 (US), \"King of the Hill!\", [[Perceptor]] summoned his fellow Autobots [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]], Jetfire, [[Omega Supreme]], Ratchet and [[Silverbolt]] in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon [[Trypticon]] the leader was chosen - [[Grimlock]].\n\nSometime later, Jetfire was among the Transformers who attempted to defend [[New York City]] from the cosmically-powered Starscream, only to be deactivated alongside everyone else. Unlike most of Starscream's victims, there was no indication that he was revived through the power of nucleon.\n\n===Games===\nThe ''Robots in Disgise'' Classic line appeared in a simple [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based video game on the Hasbro web site called ''Transformers Battle Circuit''.

This figure was one of the most [[Joint|articulated]] of the early Transformer toys, featuring fully poseable shoulder, hip, elbow and knee joints, and even poseable [[sacroiliac joint]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin C.

This led to problems for Takara when they imported the Transformers toyline&nbsp;\u2014 although Hasbro was able to market the Jetfire toy in their markets, [[Takara]] was not, nor could they promote it via the animated series, since the mold was owned by their main competitor, and therefore, it was viewed as potential free advertising for Takatoku (this issue also prevented the Deluxe Vehicles, Deluxe Insecticons, [[Omega Supreme]], and Sky Lynx from being released in Japan, though after Takara merged with [[Tomy]], the latter two were finally released in Japan). Although an animation model had been created for Jetfire based on the appearance of the toy (which could be seen in the original toy commercial advertising the figure), this was quickly abandoned and completely redesigned so as to no longer resemble the Valkyrie. This was the design that went on to feature in the comics and cartoons.\n:Jetfire only saw a few American production runs, as the show the original toy was based upon, ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', was exported to America to become the first third of ''[[Robotech]]''. Ironically, since Hasbro released Jetfire first, there was never a U.S. release of an authentic transforming version of the toy for ''Robotech'', even though the design was the series' most recognizable and popular mecha. As with other pre-''Robotech'' borrowings from ''Macross'' (for instance, ''[[BattleTech]]''), the licensing situation for the toy became murky with two different companies ([[Big West Advertising|Big West]] and [[Tatsunoko Production]]) asserting exclusive rights to license ''Macross'' merchandise outside Japan. Due to these legal issues, Jetfire has not been among the Transformers toys reissued in the 21st century, instead being offered as part of the War For Cybertron: Siege toyline in his cartoon/comic design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=oQ8-AAAAEBAJ|title= Changeable robot toy&nbsp;\u2014 Google Patent Search|publisher=google|accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>\n:This toy is patented in the U.S. as patent number D287037.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD287037S/en|title=Changeable robot toy|author=|date=|website=google.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n* '''''Generation 2'' Cyberjet Jetfire''' (1995)\n:The first new Jetfire in a decade was a member of the [[Cyberjets]], highly poseable, ball-jointed jets with pressure-activated launching missiles. A repaint of the Decepticon figure released at the same time named Hooligan -- and consequently erroneously decorated with Decepticon symbols -- this figure bore some physical resemblance to his original (unarmored) self, although his color scheme and missile launcher arm drew attention away from his familiar shape.

The bio of this figure specifically noted that Jetfire was the leader of the Cyberjets, although the original figure's bio made no mention of it. R-Blade comes with the missile weapon as a ''sonic lance'' and a ''flare gun''.\n* '''''Titanium'' 6&nbsp;inch Jetfire''' (2006)\n:Released in the second wave of the die-cast metal ''Transformers: Titanium'' line, this 6\" version of Jetfire is based on his Cybertronian mode from Dreamwave's ''[[Transformers: The War Within|War Within]]'' comic book series.\n* '''''Classics'' Voyager Jetfire''' (2007)\n:Part of the second wave of releases for the ''Transformers Classics'' toy line, this incarnation of Jetfire has a removable booster pack and helmet; with them attached (and excluding the translucent blue missiles), the toy looks much like the ''Macross'' (Super) Valkyrie-based original. Without them, he is closer to Skyfire's appearance on the Generation 1 cartoon. His double-barreled rifle was also made to resemble Skyfire's weapon from the cartoon. Some fans have also found a sort of \"hidden\" mode with the Classics figure. Due to the toy's unusual hip design, it can be configured into a Gerwalk-like mode, although no official public documentation by Hasbro, on the website or instruction sheet, specifies this. Without armor, Jetfire's vehicle mode resembles an [[F-14 Tomcat]], with exhaust design elements inspired by the [[F-22 Raptor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oafe.net/yo/tfcl_jf.php |title=Transformers Classics: Jetfire review |publisher=OAFE |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:A printing error on the back of the Classic Grimlock box used Jetfire's picture as one of his co-sells, but listed him as the Decepticon Astrotrain.\n:This toy was remolded into the [[BotCon]] 2007 exclusive Timelines Dreadwind and the 2008 ''Universe'' Series Tread Bolt.\n\n[[File:Su-27 low pass.jpg|right|thumb|The SU-27 Flanker]]\n* '''''Classics'' Legends Jetfire''' (2007)\n:First seen at Botcon 2006, the Legends Jetfire is a repaint of ''Cybertron'' Legends [[Thundercracker]] in the traditional colors of Jetfire.<ref>{{cite web|author=TFormers.com |url=http://tformers.com/ig.php?mode=view&album=6593&pic=IMG_3503.jpg&dispsize=800&start=20 |title=Photo of Micro Jetfire at Botcon 2006 |publisher=Tformers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:This version of Jetfire turns into an SU-27 Flanker jet.\n* '''''Henkei!

The friendly nature that keeps him popular amongst the Autobots hides a strong sense of intelligent judgment that has saved his team from numerous predicaments, and means that he will even speak up and tell Prime that he is wrong to his face.\n\n===Animated series===\n====''Transformers: Armada''====\nIn this series, he is very boastful. When Optimus Prime led a small force to Earth to investigate the [[Mini-Con]] signal emanating from that world, Jetfire was left in charge on Cybertron, but eventually later departed the planet to join his commander on Earth. Arriving shortly after the Decepticon tactician [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]], Jetfire scanned an Earthen space shuttle upon approach to the planet and burst onto the scene in the middle of a battle, his energetic and unexpected arrival completely throwing off Thrust's meticulous plan and allowing the Autobots to claim victory. When Thrust arranged the next Decepticon attack on the Autobots, Jetfire once again proved to be the monkey wrench in his plan when he and Optimus Prime revealed their ability to combine together, once again foiling the villain's schemes. Although, Optimus Prime said \"Jet Convoy\" the first time they combined, later in the series he referred to it as Jet Optimus.\n\nJetfire's unique space-flight abilities make him a distinct asset to the Autobot forces, allowing them to recover a Mini-Con from [[Mars]]. He journeys there together with [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]] who had joined the Autobots at that time. Jetfire is displeased that the turncoat Decepticon will keep his company, but he cannot do anything about it, for Starscream simply takes off the first and leaves him behind. So Jetfire has the only alternative to follow \"this brainless robot\" reluctantly. On the way to Mars, however, he loses sight of Starscream and finds him only with the aid of the [[Star Saber|Air Defense Mini-Con Team]]. He invites Starscream to look for the Mini-Con together, but the latter refuses. Then Jetfire arrests and shackles Starscream for insubordination. While Jetfire towes his prisoner back to Earth, Megatron and Tidal Wave attack them. But, in spite of their disagreement, Jetfire and Starscream prove to be capable of acting as a team. So they succeed in resisting the enemy and in rescuing the Mini-Con.\n\nIt is noteworthy that after Starscream refuses his help, though being seriously damaged, Jetfire remarks that he is \"stubborn as usual\"; supposedly, he had already got to know Starscream's nature well enough.\n\nWhen Optimus Prime dies at the hands of the Decepticon super-weapon, the Hydra Cannon, Jetfire steps down to allow [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] to assume command, retaining his secondary position even when Prime was returned to life by the power of the Mini-Cons. Jetfire goes on to participate in the \"Unicron Battles,\" when the planet-eating giant robot [[Unicron]] attacks Cybertron, and returns the Autobots' human allies Rad, Carlos and Alexis to Earth after the battle is won.\n\n====''Transformers: Energon''====\nOver the ensuing decade, Jetfire (now called '''Skyfire''' in Japan) received an upgrade into a new body-form, and received the Spark of Combination from Primus, allowing him to combine with other Autobots, most frequently the rookie trooper Ironhide, who he had to carefully train and walk through the combination process. Despite his external changes, however, Jetfire remained consistent in personality and outlook, always ready with a witty remark to keep the mood light even in the middle of a pitched battle. He is once again, the second-in-command of the Autobots.\n\nWhen the resurrected Unicron came under the control of [[Megatron]], Primus used his powers to permanently super-charge some of the Autobots, Jetfire included, recoloring their armor. The resultant battle saw Unicron's body destroyed, but his spark endured and possessed Megatron&nbsp;\u2014 now [[Galvatron]] - who grew to colossal size. In order to combat the giant villain, Jetfire and the Autobots took their Spark of Combination to the ultimate extreme, transforming their bodies into pure energy and merging with Optimus Prime, enlarging him to similar proportions and allowing him to battle Galvatron directly. Ironically it was Galvatron who was ultimately the instrument of Unicron's defeat when he plunged himself into an energon sun created by Primus in order to stop Unicron from taking over his body permanently.\n\n====''Transformers: Cybertron''====\nIn order to recuperate after the stresses of the final battle against Unicron, Jetfire ('''Dreadrock''' in Japan, a new character there, not the same as the Jetfire from ''Superlink'', but is still the Autobot's second-in-command)<ref>{{Cite journal | author = | title = Transformers - Galaxy Force Secret Special DVD!| journal = TV Magazine| volume = | issue = | pages= |date = February 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvsjngLBR54}}</ref> took some time out to vacation of the planet of Nebulos, where he inadvertently picked up the local accent (resembling Earthen [[Australia]]n). His relaxation was brought to an end, however, when Primus's energon sun collapsed in on itself, forming a gigantic black hole that threatened the safety of Cybertron.\n\nReturning to the planet, Jetfire helped the Autobots there evacuate, relocating once more to Earth, where he suggested the Autobots revisit the idea of taking on Earthly vehicle alternate modes to hide themselves from the populace, adopting for himself a new cargo plane alternate mode. He went on to develop a rivalry with Decepticon [[Thundercracker]] over who was the superior flyer. Jetfire was Optimus Prime's second-in-command in this series, and was rather cocky. Jetfire participated in many of the battles on Earth, Cybertron and Giant Planet.\n\nIn the episode \"Warp\", It is revealed that he has a fear of needles ([[trypanophobia]]).\n\nIn the episode \"Unfinished\", when the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Animatros back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The jungle planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], the Autobots, the former Decepticons, and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.\n\nAfter the threat of the black hole was thwarted, he was appointed leader of Cybertron in Optimus Prime's absence.\n\nJetfire wields two guns, and is able to generate twin whirlwinds from his shoulders. His Earth-type Cyber Key activates twin missiles in his back. Later, the Jetfire toy was repainted as a Decepticon named Sky Shadow. His bio says that Sky Shadow is actually an undercover Jetfire.\n\n===Dreamwave Productions===\n====''Transformers: Energon''====\nOver the following decade, Jetfire retained his position as Autobot second in command through the Autobot/Decepticon alliance. Unicron's threat, however, had not been ended, as was proven when the [[Terrorcon]]s; dissident Decepticons given new powers through Unicron's intermediary agent, [[Alpha Q]]uintesson; attacked the AlterEnergy research facility on Earth and Jetfire, now equipped with the Spark of Combination, joined the other Autobots in defending it and its human occupants.\n\nThe Terrorcon threat underwent sudden, horrific multiplication when they were cloned through Unicron's power, and massive swarms of them assaulted key cities across Earth. Jetfire petitioned the High Council to allow more troops and energon to be dedicated to Earth, and it was only through the efforts of council member Avalon that his appeal was accepted. A large strike force under Jetfire's command was assembled and sent to Earth, with Jetfire taking a portion of the team (Bulkhead, Cliffjumper, Landquake, Perceptor and Tow-Line) to [[Los Angeles]]. Despite fighting a tough battle, it was soon apparent that the Autobots were not going to win, until Megatron; reborn in a vastly powerful new body; came blasting onto the scene and shattered the Terrorcon forces, allowing Autobot victory.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIDW's Transformers Collectors Club exclusive comic story, \"Revelations Part 6\", is set after the defeat of [[Galvatron]] but before Optimus Prime's mission to start a new Space Bridge project. In this story the Autobots from the Fun Publications stories (''Robots in Disguise'' [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]], [[Ultra Magnus]], Sentinel Maximus, [[Downshift (Transformers)|Downshift]], [[Perceptor]], [[Alpha Trion]], Over-Run, [[Anti-Blaze]], [[Checkpoint (Transformers)|Checkpoint]], and [[Scythe (Transformers)|Scythe]]) meet the Autobots from the animated series (''Cybertron'' [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]], Jetfire, Override, [[Scattorshot]], [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]], [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]], [[Lori (Transformers)|Lori]], Bud, and [[Coby Hansen]]) and thank each other and remembering those who were lost in the battles.\n\n===Toys===\n* '''''Armada'' Jetfire with Comettor''' (2002)\n:Jetfire transforms into a space shuttle; the landing gear becomes a shield for his robot mode, while one of the three thrusters becomes a large gun with electronic engine and laser noises. Jetfire is packaged with the Mini-Con '''Comettor''', who transforms into a lunar rover and mounts as landing gear for Jetfire in shuttle mode. When plugged into the gun/thruster, Comettor triggers two spring-loaded tail fins to pop out, and switches the laser noise to a \"5-4-3-2-1\" countdown. When plugged into the shuttle's wings, Comettor causes two bombs to drop, which can also be stored in other inactive slots. Jetfire can also transform into a set of legs, atop which Optimus Prime's super mode torso can attach, forming '''Jet Optimus''' (Jet Convoy in Japan).\n:A special Target store exclusive bonus pack of Armada Jetfire with Commetor came with the Space Team Mini-Cons Payload, Skyblast and Astroscope.\n:According to the ''Transformers Collectors Club'' magazine, the vehicle mode of this Jetfire is inspired by the X-71 Shuttle from the 1998 film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''.\n* {{anchor|Spacewarp}} '''''Armada'' Powerlinx Jetfire with Comettor''' (2003)\n:A blue and white redeco of the ''Armada'' Jetfire figure, representing Jetfire in his enhanced body, as seen in the ''Transformers: Armada'' comic books.\n:A redeco of this mold was intended for release in Transformers: Universe as the Decepticon '''Spacewarp''', but this was canceled. A slightly altered version of this toy was later revived as an exclusive for the Official Transformers Collectors Club, as the classic Decepticon [[Astrotrain]], with a new head sculpt to resemble the character's classic head design.\n* '''''Energon'' Jetfire''' (2004)\n:The new ''Energon'' incarnation of Jetfire features a spring-loaded missile launcher and undercarriage grabber claws. The figure bears a golden Powerlinx symbol, meaning that it can combine with other figures of the same size, forming either a torso or legs to do so. Connecting the figure with another produces an electronic linking noise, while pushing down on Jetfire's head yields a sped-up version of the classic \"transformation\" sound. The toy can also link with smaller silver Powerlinx figures, but the results are disproportionate, and not used in the animated series, comics, or the figure's English instructions.\n* '''''Micron Legends'' Skyfire S''' (2005)\n:Another blue and white Jetfire redeco, this time of the ''Energon'' toy. Released in Japan as \"Skyfire S\" (the \"S\" stands for \"Sonic\"), it represents the character in his upgraded form from the animated series. The toy was also released in Hasbro markets, but as a different character named Overcast, Jetfire's brother.\n* '''''Cybertron'' Ultra Jetfire''' (2005)\n:The new ''Cybertron'' incarnation of Jetfire is armed with twin firing missile launchers, which mount under his wings in plane mode. Pressing on the rear of his tail engines activates an electronic engine noise, while flipping the tail section up changes the noise to a shrill laser blast. Inserting the figure's Earth [[Cyber Planet Key]] into the tail section causes a pair of twin guns to pop up, changing the noise once more, into an explosive blast. The toy features some auto-transforming features&nbsp;\u2014 by snapping the nosecone into the hips during the transformation into robot mode, two small missile cluster launchers are popped out, while straightening the arms at the elbows automatically extends the fists.\n:Like most toys sold in the ''Galaxy Force'' toy line by Takara, then later in the ''Cybertron'' toy line by Hasbro, there are small paint differences between the two versions of the toy. The Hasbro version has a code number on the back of his [[Cyber Key]], while the Takara version has no number on his [[Force Chip]].\n:This toy was recolored into [[Transformers (film)|2007 live-action movie]] [[Jetstorm]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cybertron.ca/boards/showthread.php?t=5632 |title=Canadian Transformers News and Discussion&nbsp;\u2014 You read it here first |publisher=Cybertron.CA |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n:This toy stands 19 centimeters tall in robot mode. In the animated series Jetfire is depicted as standing 24 feet (or 732 centimeters) tall. This would make this toy 1/39 scale if you base the toy on the size depicted in the show.\n:A real An-225 has a wing span of 8840 centimeters, while this toy has a wingspan of 27 centimeters, making this toy have a scale of about 1/327 of the real world vehicle. With the toy robot mode standing 19 centimeters tall, the actual robot mode of this character would stand about 6220 centmeters (204 feet) tall.\n\n* '''''Cybertron'' Burger King Jetfire''' (2005)\n:A small simple version of Cybertron Jetfire was sold with Burger King kids meals.\n* '''''Cybertron'' Legends Jetfire''' (2006)\n:A small version of the larger ''Cybertron'' Jetfire toy, this figure features a simplified transformation scheme that imitates the bigger figure. In 2007 a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toy was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave. All identical to their original releases.\n:This toy stands 8.5 centimeters tall in robot mode. In the animated series, Jetfire is depicted as standing 24 feet (or 732 centimeters) tall. This would make this toy 1/86 scale.\n:Repainted in 2007 as Classic Legends [[Fireflight (Transformers)]].\n* '''''Cybertron'' Ultra Sky Shadow''' (2006)\n:A recolor of the ''Cybertron'' Jetfire figure in tan, black and maroon, this figure represents Jetfire in a Decepticon guise used for under cover missions. The name is a reference to the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' [[Predacon]] Sky Shadow, whose name Jetfire apparently found in the Cybertron Archives&nbsp;\u2014 although quite how he would have found information about an individual from a different continuity is puzzling at best (leading one to believe that the name may actually be a reference to [[Transformers: Energon|Sky Shadow from Transformers Energon]]). Because this recolor was a Hasbro exclusive made after the animated series was already produced in Japan, he did not appear in the television series.\n* '''Transformable Robot Armor Battleplane''' (2007)\n:A Chinese-made unofficial toy based on the Legends of Cybertron Jetfire in a larger size and with slightly different colors. Came with an additional rifle accessory. Available at discount stores like [[Big Lots]].\n\n==Transformers 3D Battle Card game (2007)==\n{{Transformers character|\n name = Jetfire\n|image = Jetfire-tfmoviecard.jpg\n|caption = Jetfire in the ''Transformers'' 3D Battle Card game\n|affiliation = Autobot\n|subgroup =\n|rank =\n|function = Air Guardian\n|partner =\n|motto =\n|alternatemodes = [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]]\n|series =''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers (2007)]]''\n|engvoice =\n|japanvoice =\n}}\n\nJetfire is among the characters which first appeared in the 2007 ''Transformers'' 3D Battle Card game by [[Wizards of the Coast]].

Originally serving the Fallen, Jetfire is one of the few Transformers to remain on Earth since the dawn of humanity.\n\nAccording to the biography and statistics published on the Hasbro web site, Jetfire is 50 feet tall and his main weapon is a battle-axe. In the film, he also has a missile launcher. As an emphasis on his old age, he carries a walking stick that transforms into the front landing gear of his jet mode. In the film, he can project hologram clips from the palm of his left hand similar to how Optimus Prime did in the 2007 film through his eyes.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nJetfire was spotlighted in ''Tales of the Fallen'' issue #3. He was depicted as a member of the Decepticons under the leadership of the Fallen, serving the villain due to being tricked as to believe he was working for Cybertron's benefit. However, when the other Primes confronted the Fallen on Earth, Jetfire realized his mistake and was teleported to an unknown location. Jetfire fought many other ancient Decepticons there and eventually went into stasis after his victory. He awakened in the mid 20th century and scanned an SR-71 Blackbird before returning to stasis. His Decepticon insignia was unchanged even when he switched sides to the Autobots.<ref>{{cite web|author=TFormers.com |url=http://tformers.com/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=1097 |title=TFormers.com |publisher=TFormers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Defiance'' issue #4, which is a prequel to the movie series, a younger Jetfire is seen in his Cybertronian mode, traveling the galaxy for star-orbited planets, in a flashback told by the Fallen to Megatron.\n\n===Books===\nIn the novel adaptation of ''Revenge of the Fallen'', Jetfire is confronted just after arriving in Egypt by his fellow Decepticon Seeker [[Ransack (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Ransack]]. After firing off an ineffective round at Jetfire, Ransack is crushed under Jetfire's foot.\n\n===Movie plot===\n[[File:Hunan International Economics University45.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of Jetfire, located in [[Hunan International Economics University]].]]\nJetfire is found by [[Witwicky family#Samuel James Witwicky|Sam Witwicky]], [[Mikaela Banes]] and Seymour Simmons at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]], an annex of the [[National Air and Space Museum]], after [[Wheelie (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Wheelie]] pinpoints the general location of the ancient [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seeker]]. Sam reactivates him with an Allspark fragment, waking him up from stasis lock. After a misunderstanding when the humans saw his Decepticon insignia, Jetfire activates a Space Bridge to teleport Sam and his friends to [[Egypt]], explaining to them the origin of the Primes (who he seems to have a certain type of respect for) and the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. Learning of [[Optimus Prime]]'s existence and death, Jetfire sends them to find the Matrix, which he speculates can be used to revive Optimus (Although it could also be used to power [[Fallen (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|the Fallen]]'s technology).\n\nHe later joined the Autobots in battling the Decepticon forces in Egypt, killing the Decepticon weapons expert Mixmaster, before being badly injured by Scorponok. In a final act of sacrifice, he took his own life to enable Optimus to use his parts for an upgrade for his battle with the Fallen.\n\n===Games===\nJetfire is a playable character in the [[PS2]] and [[Wii]] versions of the ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' video game and is in the new downloadable content pack for the [[PS3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. He is only playable in multiplayer mode.\n\nHe also appeared in the video game Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark.\n\n===Toys===\nAll toys of this character are officially licensed from [[Lockheed Martin]].\n\n* '''''Revenge of the Fallen'' Legends Class Jetfire''' (2009) In September 2008, pictures of a mold for a Legends Class Jetfire appeared online.

Both Jetfire and Jetstorm speak with Russian accents. Apparently they are Sentinel Prime's soldiers, obeying his every command.

Both he and Jetstorm speak with Russian accents. Apparently they are Sentinel Prime's soldiers, obeying his every command. The two also appear to have a kiddy sense of fun and amusement, as shown when [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]] plays a video game against [[Waspinator|Wasp]] to determine who is who. They both raise their hands and state that they will play the winner.\n\nJetfire reappeared in \"Five Servos of Doom\". [[Jetstorm]] wanted Jetfire to scan a picture of him in front of the recently captured [[Decepticon]] [[Blitzwing]] \"for the Femme-bots back home\". He then asked how Sentinel Prime captured Blitzwing. He was later seen with Jetfire trying to make the communicator work. He directed [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] to the Elite Guard flagship's brig, where Sentinel had just captured [[Lugnut (Transformers)|Lugnut]]. He also appeared with Jetfire in a baseball stadium, where Sentinel was working with [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]]. Jetstorm combined into [[Safeguard (Transformers)|Safeguard]] and helped rescue Sentinel, who was now in the hands of [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]]. Jetstorm was present when Prowl used Processor Over Matter to lift the rubble of the scoreboard off of him.\n\nIn \"Predacons Rising\", Bumblebee, Jetfire, Jetstorm, Optimus Prime, and Sentinel Prime chase Wasp, but lose him to Swoop while bickering about what to do with him. The group follow them to [[Blackarachnia]]'s lab, and, in the ensuing battle, Jetstorm and Jetfire hand the Dinobots a crushing defeat. In this episode after following Sentinel's orders, which got him buried headfirst in the sand, Jetfire asks, \"Should we be taking notes?\" to which Jetstorm replies, \"On what not to do?\"\n\nJetfire and his twin appeared in \"Decepticon Air\", fighting back against the escaped Decepticons captured on Earth.\n\nThey appeared again in \"This is Why I Hate Machines\", surprised to see Ratchet and Captain Fanzone on Cybertron.

He proves to be a valuable asset, and remains behind on Cybertron to aid the Wreckers when the ''Ark'' departs. Despite his valiant efforts, some Autobots-notably Wheeljack-continued to doubt his loyalty and suspected that he was a double-agent for the Decepticons. Jetfire proved his loyalty by joining a mission under Ultra Magnus to rescue [[Alpha Trion]] from Shockwave.\n\n===Games===\nJetfire is one of the playable Autobots in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'', and speaks with an English accent (similar to his film incarnation). In the Decepticon campaign, he starts out as one of [[Starscream#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]]'s partners in charge of guarding the dark energon. He also tries to warn [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]] about the deadly effects of dark energon, but his cries fall on deaf ears, as the Decepticon leader immerses himself in it, becoming more powerful. After that Starscream turns his allegiance to Megatron. Jetfire fled the scene, joining the Autobots. \n\nIn the Autobot campaign, Jetfire joins [[Air Raid (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Air Raid]] and [[Silverbolt#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Silverbolt]] in flying in orbit of Cybertron to take down the armed Decepticon orbital station [[Trypticon#Transformers: Prime|Trypticon]], which is preventing Autobot transport ships from leaving the dying planet. The aerial trio enter Trypticon and destroy his cooling systems and plasma reactor, disabling his main weapon. Unfortunately, the attacks are not enough to disable Trypticon, so they enter his core and destroy his transformation cog, forcing him to revert into his true form. Forced to transform into dinosaur mode, Trypticon sets a course toward the Autobot city of Iacon with the intent of decimating it, but the Autobot trio destroy his flight pack, sending him crashing into the planet. This leaves [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers: Prime|Optimus Prime]] and his ground-based team with the task of finishing off Trypticon before he lays further waste on Iacon.\n\nJetfire is playable in the last level of ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''.

At first believing the imperial guard Fuca Fuheng to be the prime suspect, Yingluo schemes to approach his sister, the [[Empress Xiaoxianchun|Empress Fuca]] Rongyin, and succeeds in getting transferred from her embroidery unit to the Empress's Changchun Palace as her maid. Over time, she learns that the Fuca siblings are honest and kindhearted people, innocent of the crime, and even develops romantic affections for Fuheng, who is admired by many around the Palace, including Qianlong's Consort Chun who allies herself to Empress Fuca because of a deep-seated crush on her brother.\n\nThough Yingluo is not noble by birth and is illiterate, the kindhearted Empress Fuca teaches her how to read and write, along with all the proper etiquette and mannerisms for noblewomen at the time. Yingluo also helps Empress Fuca survive a series of maneuvers by her chief rivals, becoming a trusted friend and confidant while never forgetting her own agenda of avenging her sister's murder. In time, Yingluo discovers that the actual murderer is a Consort of the late [[Yongzheng Emperor|Emperor Yongzheng]] and mother of Qianlong's half brother, and hatches a plot to drive the culprit to her untimely death. Empress Fuca, for fear of Qianlong's fury over Yingluo's outrageous action, quickly banishes her to the palace sanitation unit to escape from his decree of punishment. There, Yingluo befriends and becomes sworn brothers with a conniving eunuch, Yuan Chunwang, who is subsequently revealed to be a bastard son of Emperor Yongzheng.\n\nWithout Yingluo, Empress Fuca falls victim to the machinations of Noble Consort Gao that puts her in a coma. News reaches Yingluo who hurriedly steals midnight visits into Empress Fuca's chamber to sit by her mistress's side and care for her. Yingluo's devotion to Empress Fuca convinces Qianlong to relent on his tough stance towards her and eventually allows her to return as maid.  Empress Fuca is able to wake from her coma, and even becomes pregnant again. She goes through almost life-ending labor to give birth to another son, who is immediately the target of assassination by the duplicitous Consort Chun, devastated for having been rejected by Fuheng. Empress Fuca is driven to suicide when she is not able to save her newborn in a bizarre fire that rose overnight. After Empress Fuca's death, Yingluo is sent to live and guard over her mistress's grave at the [[Old Summer Palace]]. She stays there for a number of years with Yuan Chunwang until one year (1750), during an imperial visit by Qianlong and his consorts to Fuca's grave, Yingluo unexpectedly learns that Consort Chun was responsible for her late mistress's suicide. She decides once again to enter the Forbidden City and exact retribution on the evildoers.\n\nIn order to achieve the goal, Yingluo knows she needs the hand of authority so she soon sets her eyes on the Emperor. She skillfully charms Qianlong, becoming part of his harem, and is bestowed a title, Consort Ling. With meticulous planning, she topples her rivals one after another, including the villainess, now Noble Consort Chun, even insofar as exposing her role in Empress Fuca's death, which incidentally leads to her fall from grace at the hands of Yingluo's archrival, the newly-named [[Hoifa-Nara, the Step Empress|Empress Hoifa-Nara]] (1751). Yingluo's captivation of Qianlong brings her numerous threats, such as from newcomer [[Fragrant Concubine|Concubine Shun]], a beautiful and cunning woman dead set to even the score with Qianlong and Fuheng for having been forced into political marriage in the Forbidden City. Framing Yingluo for attempted assassination, Concubine Shun deftly teams up with Empress Hoifa-Nara to put Yingluo under house arrest and pull strings to starve her nearly to death. Nevertheless, Yingluo is able to reverse her situation, reveal Shun's treachery, and restore Qianlong's affections for her. Having reached stalemate at this point, Yingluo negotiates for a truce with Hoifa-Nara on the condition that they both not harm any children of the palace in spite of the rivalry.\n\nA decade later (1765), however, the nihilistic Yuan Chunwang betrays Yingluo and joins Hoifa-Nara, causing a series of mishaps in the palace that even force the Empress's hand and break her hold on power. Hongzhou, the Emperor's brother, at the same time plots to sabotage Qianlong's Southern river tour. On a chosen night, a band of rebels suddenly storms onto the royal vessel just as a fire engulfs the Empress Dowager's cabin, prompting Qianlong to charge into the flaming cabin to save his mother, seemingly perishing himself in the process.\n\nThe next morning, as Hongzhou gallantly appears to restore order from the overnight coup, Qianlong and the Empress Dowager emerge safely from a secret passageway that had been purposely designed by Fuheng and expose Hongzhou's plan of treachery. After Qianlong sentences Hongzhou to death, Yuan Chunwang gets on his knees in front of the Emperor and claims he is a long-lost son of the Yongzheng Emperor. The Empress Dowager denies this, ever so slyly, which drives Yuan Chunwang into utter madness while leaving others unable to determine whether or not it is to protect Qianlong. At this time, Consort Ling comes out of hiding under the protection of the Emperor's guards, prompting Hoifa-Nara to protest once and for all the Emperor's lavished attention for Yingluo alone. In a fit of rage and jealousy, she cuts off her own hair, a taboo in Manchu tradition analogous to an outcry for divorce, effectively cursing the entire Aisin Gioro clan.\n\nAt the end, Empress Hoifa-Nara is permitted to keep her title, but loses all of the Emperor's affections. Wei Yingluo is elevated to a new title, 'Imperial Noble Consort', the highest possible rank for someone of non-noble birth. Remembering Empress Fuca's teachings, she embodies all the qualities of a virtuous consort, and supports the Emperor until death.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u5ef6\u79a7\u653b\u7565\u62cd\u6444\u5236\u4f5c\u5907\u6848 |url=http://dsj.sarft.gov.cn/tims/site/views/applications/note/noteTable.shanty?id=0159ab8ffe821da24028e4a159880a14 |website=SAFRT |publisher=SAFRT |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:20%\"|Character !!

The acquisition of these skills requires a lifetime commitment to perfect, since they are unsurprisingly labor-intensive, demanding a sharp eye and tireless hands in order to replicate in painstaking detail the exclusive nature of their beauty.\n\n==== Velvet flowers (ronghua) ====\nThe velvet flower headwear used by the main characters was designed based on historical documents or antiques housed in the [[Forbidden City|Palace Museum]]. Each adornment is created according to the characteristics of individual palace women. Zhao Shuxian, one of the few craftsmen still making velvet flowers, created all the headwear in the show using the art of making velvet flower (ronghua).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2125483/meet-chinese-artisan-fighting-keep-his-silky-skills-alive|title=Meet the Chinese artisan fighting to keep his silky skills alive|date=2017-12-23|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> This technique dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and refers to the creation of not only floral displays, but also animal shapes made by silk on a twisted wire frame.<ref name=\"flower\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/13/WS5b713833a310add14f3857b8_1.html|title=Velvet flower headwear in hit online drama turns heads|date=August 13, 2018|website=China Daily}}</ref>\n\n==== Jeweled hairpins ([[tian-tsui]]) ====\nWorn by the Empress and Consorts as status symbols of opulence, these are hairpins of a particular vibrant blue hue, made from the preserved feathers of the wings and back of the [[kingfisher]] bird.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/2166904/story-yanxi-palace-how-authentic-are-accessories-worn|title=How authentic are the accessories worn in 'Story of Yanxi Palace'?|website=South China Morning Post|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The technique resembles [[cloisonn\u00e9]], and when inlaid with pearls and other gemstones, are especially eye-catching the way a peacock dazzles fanning its tail.\n\nThe success of the drama is due in no small part to the contributions of numerous artisans and craftspeople behind the scenes that lend to the authenticity of [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] era fashion and style visible in every frame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hanfugirl.blog/2018/08/22/qing-dynasty-show-styling-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-make-up-accessories-episode/|title=Qing dynasty show styling\u2013The good, the bad and the ugly (Make-up & Accessories episode)|last=Hanfugirl|date=2018-08-21|website=#Hanfugirl|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe series has generated buzz online for its engaging plot of a \"Cinderella\" tale with Chinese characteristics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2018-07-24/doc-ihftenhz4090120.shtml|title=\"\u5ef6\u79a7\u653b\u7565\"\u98a0\u8986\u5bab\u6597\u5957\u8def \"\u7d2b\u7981\u57ce\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\"\u4e00\u8def\u6253\u602a\u5347\u7ea7|date=July 24, 2018|website=Sina|language=zh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201808/03/WS5b63c0e3a3100d951b8c86e6.html|title=Traditional Chinese culture stars in hit drama|date=August 3, 2018|website=China Daily}}</ref> It set the single-day online viewership record in China with a total of 530 million views, and has attracted a cumulative over 13 billion views since August 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2159591/how-back-stabbing-imperial-concubines-helped-chnas-iqiyi-set-viewership-record|title=How Story of Yanxi Palace\u2019s back-stabbing imperial concubines helped China\u2019s iQiyi set a viewership record|date=August 14, 2018|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref> The drama is the most viewed Chinese language drama of 2018.<ref name=\"worldwide\" /> The drama was also the most Googled show on earth in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-46630781|title=Yanxi Palace: The most Googled show on Earth|date=December 24, 2018|agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\nMany viewers praised the story, because unlike the usual amicable heroines, the main character Wei Yingluo fights fire with fire and outmaneuvers her opponents.<ref name=\"flower\" /> It also received praise for its well-developed cast of characters and exciting interpretation by the actors;

At first believing the imperial guard Fuca Fuheng to be the prime suspect, Yingluo schemes to approach his sister, the [[Empress Xiaoxianchun|Empress Fuca]] Rongyin, and succeeds in getting transferred from her embroidery unit to the Empress's Changchun Palace as her maid. Over time, she learns that the Fuca siblings are honest and kindhearted people, innocent of the crime, and even develops romantic affections for Fuheng, who is admired by many around the Palace, including Qianlong's Consort Chun who allies herself to Empress Fuca because of a deep-seated crush on her brother.\n\nThough Yingluo is not noble by birth and is illiterate, the kindhearted Empress Fuca teaches her how to read and write, along with all the proper etiquette and mannerisms for noblewomen at the time. Yingluo also helps Empress Fuca survive a series of maneuvers by her chief rivals, becoming a trusted friend and confidant while never forgetting her own agenda of avenging her sister's murder. In time, Yingluo discovers that the actual murderer is a Consort of the late [[Yongzheng Emperor|Emperor Yongzheng]] and mother of Qianlong's half brother, and hatches a plot to drive the culprit to her untimely death. Empress Fuca, for fear of Qianlong's fury over Yingluo's outrageous action, quickly banishes her to the palace sanitation unit to escape from his decree of punishment. There, Yingluo befriends and becomes sworn brothers with a handsome but conniving eunuch, Yuan Chunwang, who is subsequently revealed to be a bastard son of Emperor Yongzheng.\n\nWithout Yingluo, Empress Fuca falls victim to the machinations of Noble Consort Gao that puts her in a coma. News reaches Yingluo who hurriedly steals midnight visits into Empress Fuca's chamber to sit by her mistress's side and care for her. Yingluo's devotion to Empress Fuca convinces Qianlong to relent on his tough stance towards her and eventually allows her to return as maid.  Empress Fuca is able to wake from her coma, and even becomes pregnant again. She goes through almost life-ending labor to give birth to another son, who is immediately the target of assassination by the duplicitous Consort Chun, devastated for having been rejected by Fuheng. Empress Fuca is driven to suicide when she is not able to save her newborn in a bizarre fire that rose overnight. After Empress Fuca's death, Yingluo is sent to live and guard over her mistress's grave at the [[Old Summer Palace]]. She stays there for a number of years with Yuan Chunwang until one year (1750), during an imperial visit by Qianlong and his consorts to Fuca's grave, Yingluo unexpectedly learns that Consort Chun was responsible for her late mistress's suicide. She decides once again to enter the Forbidden City and exact retribution on the evildoers.\n\nIn order to achieve the goal, Yingluo knows she needs the hand of authority so she soon sets her eyes on the Emperor. She skillfully charms Qianlong, becoming part of his harem, and is bestowed a title, Consort Ling. With meticulous planning, she topples her rivals one after another, including the villainess, now Noble Consort Chun, even insofar as exposing her role in Empress Fuca's death, which incidentally leads to her fall from grace at the hands of Yingluo's archrival, the newly-named [[Hoifa-Nara, the Step Empress|Empress Hoifa-Nara]] (1751). Yingluo's captivation of Qianlong brings her numerous threats, such as from newcomer [[Fragrant Concubine|Concubine Shun]], a beautiful and cunning woman dead set to even the score with Qianlong and Fuheng for having been forced into political marriage in the Forbidden City. Framing Yingluo for attempted assassination, Concubine Shun deftly teams up with Empress Hoifa-Nara to put Yingluo under house arrest and pull strings to starve her nearly to death. Nevertheless, Yingluo is able to reverse her situation, reveal Shun's treachery, and restore Qianlong's affections for her. Having reached stalemate at this point, Yingluo negotiates for a truce with Hoifa-Nara on the condition that they both not harm any children of the palace in spite of the rivalry.\n\nA decade later (1765), however, the nihilistic Yuan Chunwang betrays Yingluo and joins Hoifa-Nara, causing a series of mishaps in the palace that even force the Empress's hand and break her hold on power. Hongzhou, the Emperor's brother, at the same time plots to sabotage Qianlong's Southern river tour. On a chosen night, a band of rebels suddenly storms onto the royal vessel just as a fire engulfs the Empress Dowager's cabin, prompting Qianlong to charge into the flaming cabin to save his mother, seemingly perishing himself in the process.\n\nThe next morning, as Hongzhou gallantly appears to restore order from the overnight coup, Qianlong and the Empress Dowager emerge safely from a secret passageway that had been purposely designed by Fuheng and expose Hongzhou's plan of treachery. After Qianlong sentences Hongzhou to death, Yuan Chunwang gets on his knees in front of the Emperor and claims he is a long-lost son of the Yongzheng Emperor. The Empress Dowager denies this, ever so slyly, which drives Yuan Chunwang into utter madness while leaving others unable to determine whether or not it is to protect Qianlong. At this time, Consort Ling comes out of hiding under the protection of the Emperor's guards, prompting Hoifa-Nara to protest once and for all the Emperor's lavished attention for Yingluo alone. In a fit of rage and jealousy, she cuts off her own hair, a taboo in Manchu tradition analogous to an outcry for divorce, effectively cursing the entire Aisin Gioro clan.\n\nAt the end, Empress Hoifa-Nara is permitted to keep her title, but loses all of the Emperor's affections. Wei Yingluo is elevated to a new title, 'Imperial Noble Consort', the highest possible rank for someone of non-noble birth. Remembering Empress Fuca's teachings, she embodies all the qualities of a virtuous consort, and supports the Emperor until death.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u5ef6\u79a7\u653b\u7565\u62cd\u6444\u5236\u4f5c\u5907\u6848 |url=http://dsj.sarft.gov.cn/tims/site/views/applications/note/noteTable.shanty?id=0159ab8ffe821da24028e4a159880a14 |website=SAFRT |publisher=SAFRT |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:20%\"|Character !!
