The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Other media==\n===Game===\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise. The game drew in 120 million players shortly after its initial release. The ''Tower of God'' role-playing game's development continued for two years after its initial release, and the game saw a full commercial release in 2016. In February 2016, the game ranked in the top 5 most popular games on South Korea's version of Google Play.\nIn 2019 the Webtoon Cross RPG, Hero Cantare, was released, featuring Tower of God, God of Highschool, and Hardcore Leveling Warrior.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=191863&year=2016|website=news.mk.co.kr|title=\u2018\uc6d4\uc694\uc6f9\ud230\u2019 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758\ud0d1\u2019 \u2018\ub124\uc774\ubc84\uc6f9\ud230\u2019|author=\uc778\ud134\uae30\uc790|date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> In the game, a player can choose one of the characters from the manhwa; each represents a unique [[character class]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.tf.co.kr/read/economy/1626346.htm|title=\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uac8c\uc784 '\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1 with \ub124\uc774\ubc84\uc6f9\ud230' \uc815\uc2dd \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc791|publisher=BizFact|date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name=limited>{{cite web|url=http://www.playforum.net/webzine/news/view/10999|publisher=PlayForum|title=\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1 with \ub124\uc774\ubc84\uc6f9\ud230\u2019 \uc815\uc2dd \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc791|date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.herocantareglobal.com|title=Mobile Game 'Hero Cantare with WEBTOON'Pre-register|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Merchandise===\nNaver sells a variety of ''Tower of God'' merchandise, such as [[figurine]]s.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian.

With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier.

The English fan translations had different transliterations of the names of the characters, such as Androssi Zahard (fan translation) being transliterated to Endorsi Jahad (Line Webtoon). The story and characters remain the same.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{see also|List of Tower of God characters}}\n===Plot===\n''Tower of God'' centers around a boy called Twenty-Fifth Bam, who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower, with only his close friend, Rachel, to keep him company. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Other media==\n===Game===\nIn 2013, Naver released a [[mobile game|mobile]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] on [[Google Play]] based on ''Tower of God'', developed by Sunrise. The game drew in 120 million players shortly after its initial release.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place. A mysterious blonde figure watches the groups filter in and instantly recognizes Khun.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = The Correct Door\n| TranslitTitle       = Seikai no Tobira\n| NativeTitle         = \u6b63\u89e3\u306e\u6249\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = \n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n| LineColor           = \n}}-->\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nHead of [[Line Webtoon]] Tom Akel stated in July 2015 that the manhwa's weekly installments are read by five million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/business/media/free-digital-comics-site-is-expanding-in-us-with-celebrity-help.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stan Lee and Michelle Phan Help Line Webtoon, Digital Comics Site, Expand in U.S.|last=Gustines|first=George Gene|date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> \n\nOn the original Korean platform, ''Tower of God'' is the most profitable series based on the paid preview system, where readers can buy up to 3 chapters in advance.

She later had a recurring role in the pages of ''Excalibur''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSaturnyne originally hails from Earth 9, one in a myriad of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universes]]. She is a highly intelligent and ambitious woman and ends up on [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] as the Omniversal Majestrix.  In this role she is part of the Dimensional Development Court, overseeing the [[Captain Britain Corps]] and charged with the safekeeping and maintenance of order and reality of the entire Omniverse. Saturnyne reports to Merlyn, the Omniversal Guardian. Saturnyne feels no moral or ethical conflict in sacrificing anybody, even an entire universe, if it means the preservation of the Omniverse.<ref group=s name=\"ohofmu2009\">{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z | volume=1 | issue=10 | title=Saturnyne | date=September 2009 | isbn=978-0-7851-3028-4 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nWhenever she decides to take a more personal interest in a matter, she calls upon the Avant Guard. The Avant Guard appear to be normal men, dressed in business suits and carrying an umbrella, but these umbrellas are in fact highly advanced weapons, capable of various abilities like interdimensional travel, destructive blasts and rays capable of [[devolution (fallacy)|devolving]] opponents. She is assisted by Dimples, an overweight man who loves Saturnyne deeply. Saturnyne herself cares little for Dimples and sees him only as a useful servant.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSaturnyne first came into contact with Brian Braddock, also known as [[Captain Britain]], on the alternate Earth known as the Crooked World. This Earth is deemed to be a threat to the Omniverse and Saturnyne convinces Captain Britain to help evolve the backwards planet, hoping to eliminate its threat. They are opposed by the Status Crew, a group charged with maintaining the status quo. Saturnyne and Captain Britain manage to evolve the world, but are surprised when a bigger threat take its place: an alternate reality Mad Jim Jaspers uses his powers to create the [[Jaspers' Warp]], causing widespread insanity and the collapse of reality. Captain Britain and Saturnyne want to stop him, but are stopped by the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]], a killer machine. Saturnyne flees with her Avant Guard, leaving a heartbroken Dimples, Captain Britain and his sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] behind. All three are killed by the Fury, shortly thereafter.<ref>recounted in ''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nThe Dimensional Development Court arrest Saturnyne and replace her with a man called Mandragon, who destroys the Earth 238 universe to prevent the Jaspers Warp from spreading. Merlyn resurrects Captain Britain (but not Jackdaw), and the Fury manages to escape under his own power. Captain Britain and the interdimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Special Executive]] help Saturnyne escape from the Court to Earth-616. On Earth-616, Mad Jim Jaspers, an even more powerful version than the one on Earth 238, comes into power and threatens the world. The Fury also makes its way to Earth-616 and  battles Jaspers. During the conflict, Merlyn dies (though later he would reveal that he had just faked his death). In the end the Fury kills Jaspers and is killed shortly afterwards by Captain Britain and [[Captain UK]] from Earth 238, with help from Saturnyne and the [[Special Executive]]. Saturnyne manages to obtain cell samples of Jaspers and threatens to unleash a clone on Mandragon's world if he does not return her former position to her. Merlyn's daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] succeeds her father, and Saturnyne becomes an agent of Roma.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nDespite having cooperated with Captain Britain at various times, she comes into conflict with Captain Britain when she sends the bounty-hunters known as the Technet after [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]]. The Technet fail to capture her and Phoenix joins Captain Britain, [[Shadowcat]], [[Meggan]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to form ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''.<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref> Saturnyne later meets Phoenix in person, but does not capture her.<ref>''Excalibur'' #24</ref> Saturnyne rescinds her warrant against Phoenix but indefinitely extendeds the Technet's exile on Earth. She also delivers a message from Roma asking the other Captain Britains to free Excalibur's Captain Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #42, 44</ref> Later events reveal that Saturnyne was acting under Roma's orders when she originally sent the Technet against Phoenix, and that the Technet was meant to fail, resulting in the formation of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSaturnyne remains Roma's servant and Omniversal Majestrix for the following years until the villain [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] destroys the Captain Britain Corps and imprisons Roma. Captain Britain manages to defeat Mastermind, and Roma names Captain Britain, now more powerful than ever before, the new ruler of Otherworld.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Saturnyne returns as Omniversal Majestrix, but has a bitter relationship with Brian, whom she deems unworthy of his new position.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSaturnyne is summoned by Roma when the being Abraxas tries to destroy creation.

In the following ''Excalibur'' series, Captain Britain returns to Earth-616 and joins the group, apparently giving up his duties and powers as ruler of Otherworld.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Saturnyne and Lady Roma express their concerns about the Incursions that are destroying many dimensions as Spider-UK arrives to express his concern about all the spiders across the multiverse being hunted and killed. Saturnyne rebuffs him, but Roma sympathizes with him and gives him a talisman that allows him to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining spiders.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nUltimately, Saturnyne is forced to confront the growing threat of the Incursions when the destruction of the various universes leads to the deaths of many members of the Captain Britain Corps. Saturnyne captures a Map Maker and attempts to use it to determine the cause of the Incursions. This instead brings forth an army of Map Maker robots which slaughter the Captain Britain Corps, Roma, and ultimately Saturnyne. Her last act is to place the secrets of the Starlight Citadel into the 616 Captain Britain's brain so that he can warn the Illuminati.<ref>New Avengers #28</ref>\n\nAs of the 2019 series ''Excalibur'' (v4), Saturnyne has been restored to life and is now referred to by some characters as the White Witch, and has gained a new enemy, the ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur]].

In this role she is part of the Dimensional Development Court, overseeing the [[Captain Britain Corps]] and charged with the safekeeping and maintenance of order and reality of the entire Omniverse. Saturnyne reports to Merlyn, the Omniversal Guardian. Saturnyne feels no moral or ethical conflict in sacrificing anybody, even an entire universe, if it means the preservation of the Omniverse.<ref group=s name=\"ohofmu2009\">{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z | volume=1 | issue=10 | title=Saturnyne | date=September 2009 | isbn=978-0-7851-3028-4 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nWhenever she decides to take a more personal interest in a matter, she calls upon the Avant Guard. The Avant Guard appear to be normal men, dressed in business suits and carrying an umbrella, but these umbrellas are in fact highly advanced weapons, capable of various abilities like interdimensional travel, destructive blasts and rays capable of [[devolution (fallacy)|devolving]] opponents. She is assisted by Dimples, an overweight man who loves Saturnyne deeply. Saturnyne herself cares little for Dimples and sees him only as a useful servant.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSaturnyne first came into contact with Brian Braddock, also known as [[Captain Britain]], on the alternate Earth known as the Crooked World. This Earth is deemed to be a threat to the Omniverse and Saturnyne convinces Captain Britain to help evolve the backwards planet, hoping to eliminate its threat. They are opposed by the Status Crew, a group charged with maintaining the status quo. Saturnyne and Captain Britain manage to evolve the world, but are surprised when a bigger threat take its place: an alternate reality Mad Jim Jaspers uses his powers to create the [[Jaspers' Warp]], causing widespread insanity and the collapse of reality. Captain Britain and Saturnyne want to stop him, but are stopped by the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]], a killer machine. Saturnyne flees with her Avant Guard, leaving a heartbroken Dimples, Captain Britain and his sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] behind. All three are killed by the Fury, shortly thereafter.<ref>recounted in ''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\nThe Dimensional Development Court arrest Saturnyne and replace her with a man called Mandragon, who destroys the Earth 238 universe to prevent the Jaspers Warp from spreading. Merlyn resurrects Captain Britain (but not Jackdaw), and the Fury manages to escape under his own power. Captain Britain and the interdimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Special Executive]] help Saturnyne escape from the Court to Earth-616. On Earth-616, Mad Jim Jaspers, an even more powerful version than the one on Earth 238, comes into power and threatens the world. The Fury also makes its way to Earth-616 and  battles Jaspers. During the conflict, Merlyn dies (though later he would reveal that he had just faked his death). In the end the Fury kills Jaspers and is killed shortly afterwards by Captain Britain and [[Captain UK]] from Earth 238, with help from Saturnyne and the [[Special Executive]]. Saturnyne manages to obtain cell samples of Jaspers and threatens to unleash a clone on Mandragon's world if he does not return her former position to her. Merlyn's daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] succeeds her father, and Saturnyne becomes an agent of Roma.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nDespite having cooperated with Captain Britain at various times, she comes into conflict with Captain Britain when she sends the bounty-hunters known as the Technet after [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]]. The Technet fail to capture her and Phoenix joins Captain Britain, [[Shadowcat]], [[Meggan]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to form ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''.<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref> Saturnyne later meets Phoenix in person, but does not capture her.<ref>''Excalibur'' #24</ref> Saturnyne rescinds her warrant against Phoenix but indefinitely extendeds the Technet's exile on Earth. She also delivers a message from Roma asking the other Captain Britains to free Excalibur's Captain Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #42, 44</ref> Later events reveal that Saturnyne was acting under Roma's orders when she originally sent the Technet against Phoenix, and that the Technet was meant to fail, resulting in the formation of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSaturnyne remains Roma's servant and Omniversal Majestrix for the following years until the villain [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] destroys the Captain Britain Corps and imprisons Roma. Captain Britain manages to defeat Mastermind, and Roma names Captain Britain, now more powerful than ever before, the new ruler of Otherworld.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Saturnyne returns as Omniversal Majestrix, but has a bitter relationship with Brian, whom she deems unworthy of his new position.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSaturnyne is summoned by Roma when the being Abraxas tries to destroy creation. While Roma is killed, Saturnyne uses her powers to protect Franklin Richards and Valeria.<ref>{{cite comic | title=[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]] | volume=3 | issue=48 | date=December 2001 | writer=[[Carlos Pacheco]] | cowriters=[[Rafael Marin]], [[Jeph Loeb]] | penciller=[[Jeff Johnson (artist)|Jeff Johnson]] | inker=Joe Weems | colorist=Liquid!

In the following ''Excalibur'' series, Captain Britain returns to Earth-616 and joins the group, apparently giving up his duties and powers as ruler of Otherworld.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Saturnyne and Lady Roma express their concerns about the Incursions that are destroying many dimensions as Spider-UK arrives to express his concern about all the spiders across the multiverse being hunted and killed. Saturnyne rebuffs him, but Roma sympathizes with him and gives him a talisman that allows him to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining spiders.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nUltimately, Saturnyne is forced to confront the growing threat of the Incursions when the destruction of the various universes leads to the deaths of many members of the Captain Britain Corps. Saturnyne captures a Map Maker and attempts to use it to determine the cause of the Incursions. This instead brings forth an army of Map Maker robots which slaughter the Captain Britain Corps, Roma, and ultimately Saturnyne. Her last act is to place the secrets of the Starlight Citadel into the 616 Captain Britain's brain so that he can warn the Illuminati.<ref>New Avengers #28</ref>\n\nAs of the 2019 series ''Excalibur'' (v4), Saturnyne has been restored to life and is now refered by some characters as the White Witch, and has gained a new enemy, the ancient [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur]]. It is also stated that she has replaced Merlyn as the Omniversal Guardian, but remains refered to as the Omniveral Majestrix by her minions.<ref name=\"exv4_9\">{{cite comic | title=Excalibur | issue=9 | volume=4 | writer=Tini Howard | artist=[[Marcus To]] | date=2020 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\nAccording to Alan Davis, Dave Thorpe's original script had specified Saturnyne's appearance to be based on American actress [[Veronica Lake]].<ref group=s>{{cite web | title=Saturnyne | url=http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=187 | author=[[Alan Davis]] | date=December 25, 2006 | access-date=April 19, 2020 | website=Alan Davis Forum}}</ref> Davis has explained that Saturnyne \"enjoys power, and she's a bit of an ice princess, which is why she's silver and blue, with a cold appearance\".<ref group=s>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Marvel Age]] | volume=1 | issue=100 | title=Alan Davis on Excalibur | date=May 1991 | pages=21-23 | author=[[Peter Sanderson]] | issn=8750-4367 | publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> The ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' A-Z of 2008/09 describes Saturnyne as having a [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellian mind]] and being a cunning strategist, and while not being outright brilliant (listed as a three on a scale of seven in intelligence), her indomitable strength of will and ambition has allowed her to ascend to her lofty position through hard work without being born into it.<ref group=s name=\"ohofmu2009\" />\n\n==Other versions==\nSaturnyne has counterparts on many worlds.
