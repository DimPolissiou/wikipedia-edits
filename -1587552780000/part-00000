The [[United States Census Bureau]]'s formal name for the area is the '''Cincinnati\u2013Middletown, OH\u2013KY\u2013IN Metropolitan Statistical Area'''. As of the [[2010 U.S. Census]], this MSA had a population of 2,114,580, making Greater Cincinnati the 29th most populous metropolitan area in the United States, the largest metro area primarily in Ohio, followed by Cleveland (2nd) and Columbus (3rd).<ref>[[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas]]</ref>\n\nThe Census also lists the '''Cincinnati\u2013Wilmington\u2013Maysville, OH\u2013KY\u2013IN Combined Statistical Area''', which adds [[Clinton County, Ohio]] (defined as the Wilmington, OH micropolitan area) and [[Mason County, Kentucky]] (defined as the Maysville, KY micropolitan area) for a 2014 estimated population of 2,208,450.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Population Estimates |access-date=2016-02-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe Cincinnati metropolitan area is considered part of the [[Great Lakes Megalopolis]].\n\n==Census designation history==\nThe Cincinnati, OH\u2013KY\u2013IN, MSA was originally formed by the [[United States Census Bureau]] in 1950 and consisted of the Kentucky counties of [[Campbell County, Kentucky|Campbell]] and [[Kenton County, Kentucky|Kenton]] and the Ohio county of [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton]]. As surrounding counties saw an increase in their population densities and the number of their residents employed within Hamilton County, they met Census criteria to be added to the MSA. The Hamilton\u2013Middletown, OH MSA was also formed in 1950 and consisted solely of [[Butler County, Ohio]].\n\nIn 1990, the Census changed designation of the areas known as MSAs to Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA), and a new Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) grouping was created. From 1990 through 2005, the Cincinnati\u2013Hamilton\u2013Middletown CMSA included the Cincinnati\u2013Hamilton, OH\u2013KY\u2013IN PMSA and the Hamilton\u2013Middletown, OH PMSA.\n\nAs of December 2005, Census terminology changed again, eliminating the PMSA/CMSA terminology. Consolidated Statistical Areas (CSA) combine more than one Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA). Newly defined MSAs (Metropolitan) and \u00b5SAs (Micropolitan) Statistical Areas are CBSAs. From 2005 to 2013, the Cincinnati\u2013Middletown\u2013Wilmington CSA included the Cincinnati\u2013Middletown MSA (defined as the old Cincinnati\u2013Hamilton\u2013Middletown CMSA), and Wilmington, OH \u00b5SA ([[Clinton County, Ohio]]).\n\nIn 2013, the CSA was redefined again. The Cincinnati\u2013Middletown MSA was renamed the Cincinnati MSA. The Wilmington, OH \u00b5SA remained in the CSA. The Maysville, KY \u00b5SA, which had previously consisted of Mason and [[Lewis County, Kentucky|Lewis]] Counties in Kentucky, was redefined as consisting solely of Mason County and added to the CSA. The name of the CSA accordingly changed to the Cincinnati\u2013Wilmington\u2013Maysville CSA.\n\n==Population growth==\n[[File:Highways of Greater Cincinnati.png|thumb|left|A map of [[Greater Cincinnati]]'s freeways.]]\n[[File:Downtown Cincinnati viewed from Devou Park.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Cincinnati]].]]\nThe metropolitan area's population has grown 8.1 percent between Census 2000 and the 2009 Census population estimate, just under the national population growth rate of 9.2 percent over the same period. This growth rate is about in the middle of the growth rates of other similarly sized mid western metropolitan areas. For example, the Cleveland metropolitan area lost approximately 2% of population, while Louisville gained 8%, Columbus gained 12%, and Indianapolis gained 14% over the same time period.\n\nThe 2009 population estimate from the US Census classifies population changes between natural population increases (number of births minus number of deaths) and net migration (the difference between people moving into the region minus those moving out of the region). Natural population increase contributes fundamentally all of Greater Cincinnati's population growth. A small amount of net international migration to the region is offset by a small amount of net domestic migration out of the region.<ref name=\"census.gov\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090322105436/http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/metro.html Population Estimates]</ref>\n\nThe Cincinnati Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes seven counties in Northern Kentucky and three in Southeast Indiana, is the largest metropolitan area that includes parts of Ohio, exceeding the population of [[Greater Cleveland]], though both Greater Cleveland and [[Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area|metropolitan Columbus]] have larger populations within the state of Ohio as of 2013.\n\nMost of the region's population growth has occurred in the northern counties, leading to speculation that the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky metropolitan area will eventually merge with [[Greater Dayton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/1998/11/09/story3.html |title=Ready for 'Daytonnati?'

The southern area of the region, from roughly about the Ohio River, is at the extreme northern limit of the [[humid subtropical climate]]; the north part of the region is on the extreme southern cusp of the [[humid continental climate]]. Evidence of both humid subtropical climate and humid continental climate can be found here, particularly noticeable by the presence of plants indicative of each climatic region. Within the area, the USDA climate zone rating can vary from as warm as zone 6b<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahs.org/pdfs/USDA_Map_3.03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320161223/http://www.ahs.org/pdfs/USDA_Map_3.03.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2009}}</ref> to as cool as zone 5b,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ramon Jordan |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html |title=National Arboretum \u2013 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=Usna.usda.gov |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2016-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704232205/http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html |archive-date=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with the warmest areas tending to be found closest to the [[Ohio River]]; individual [[microclimate]]s of even cooler and warmer temperature may occur in the area but are too small to be considered in the overall climate zone rating. The [[common wall lizard]], introduced from Italy in the 1950s, is an example of fauna in the area that lends a subtropical ambiance to the urban core (near downtown Cincinnati) area of the region.\n\nSignificant moderating variables for the overall climate are:\n* South and central: Ohio River, Licking River, relatively large hills and valleys, and a combined [[urban heat island]] effect due to the close proximity of the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky cities of Covington, Newport, and Downtown Cincinnati\n* Suburban: large parking lots that take up much land in Mason, West Chester, and Florence create a heat island effect.\n* North: Great Miami River, the area is situated on a glaciated flat plateau, the Miami Valley, and some urban heat island effect in the immediate area of downtown Dayton and Hamilton.\n[[File:Upland-South-mapedited.jpg|thumb|left|125px|The Upland South.]]\nTraveling through the region from North to South, a subtle but interesting change in climate can be observed and is most evidenced by the gradual increase in the occurrence of subtropical indicator plants in the landscape. Most noticeable are the Southern Magnolia and [[Mimosa]] trees, and the [[needle palm]] also may be found as a winter hardy landscape specimen in lawns near the Ohio River. During the winter, travellers from north to south will routinely observe a significant difference in snowfall/ice/rain in the region.\n\nAlthough widely accepted as part of the [[Midwest]], the Cincinnati\u2013Northern Kentucky metropolitan area is climatically and geographically located on the northern periphery of the [[Upland South]] region of the United States and is within the [[Bluegrass region]] of Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nThe area is vulnerable to occasional severe weather\u2014thunderstorms, large hail and sometimes tornadoes.\n\n{{Cincinnati weatherbox}}\n\n==In media==\n{{main|Media in Cincinnati}}\n\nCincinnati-based broadcast media outlets often use the terms \"Cincinnati metropolitan area\" and \"Tri-State Area\" to refer to their broader viewing or listening areas, especially for the purpose of weather reports or school closings.

place in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912, these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The [[First Balkan War]] began on 8 October 1912, when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire, and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913, when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its loss of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], attacked its former Balkan League allies. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with and invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911\u20131918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]\n\n[[File:Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war.

Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].\n\nThe First Balkan War had some main causes briefly presented below:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}<ref>{{cite book |title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2(History of the Hellenic Nation) |date=1974 |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon |location=Athens, Greece |isbn=9789602131107 |edition=Vol. 14}}</ref>\n\n# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.\n# The Italo-Ottoman war of 1911 and the muslims' rebelions of Kosovo and Albania showed that the Empire was deeply \"wounded\" and unable to strike back against another war.\n# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.\n# The christian populations of the european part of the Ottoman Empire were siverelly oppressed by the Ottoman Reign, and thus the Balkan States were forced to take action.\n# Most importantly, the Balkan League was formed, and its members were confident that under those circumstancies an organised and simultaneous declaration of war to the Ottoman Empire would be the only way to protect their compatriots and expand their territories in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\n===Policies of the Great Powers===\nThroughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Israel]]).\n\n[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.\n\n===Young Turk Revolution===\n{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}\nThe 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.\n\n===Reaction in the Balkan States===\n\nSerbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).\n\nOn 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online</ref>\n\nBulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 }}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.\n\n===Balkan League===\n{{Main|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]\n\nFollowing the Italian victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912 and a series of three revolts in Ottoman held Albania the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.\n\nWith the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.\n\nMontenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.\n\nThis alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable to all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.\n\n==First Balkan War==\n{{Main|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]\n\nThe three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three-quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.\n\nMontenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[\u00c7atalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait. On 7 November, in response to an Ottoman initiative, they entered into negotiations for the surrender of [[Thessaloniki]]. With the Greeks already there, and the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division moving swiftly from the north towards Thessaloniki, Hassan Tahsin Pasha considered his position to be hopeless. {{sfn|Hall|2000|p=61}}. The Greeks offered more attractive terms than the Bulgarians did. On 8th November, Tahsin Pasha agreed to terms and 26,000 Ottoman troops passed over into Greek captivity. Before the Greeks entered the city, a German warship whisked the former sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] out of Thessaloniki to continue his exile, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. With their army in Thessaloniki, the Greeks took new positions to the east and northeast, including [[Nigrita]]. On 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) Greece expanded its occupied area and teamed up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref>\n\nOn the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}\n\nIn January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the \u00c7atalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.\n\n==Second Balkan War==\n{{Main|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]]\n\nThough the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.\n\nWhen the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be an 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedea\u011fa\u00e7 (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.\n\nGreece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace\u2014and confirming Greek concerns\u2014Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.\n\nSimilarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).\n\nThe Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties,{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}\n\nOn 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web| date= Winter 1995| url= http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| title= THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA| publisher= Magazine: Australia &World Affairs| accessdate= 15 April 2008| last= George Phillipov| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies.

Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis\u2013Lachanas]]]]\nBy 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.\n\nRomania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} from the center of [[Sofia]].\n\nSeeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==\n[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:Serbian poster celebrating victory over Bulgarina in the second Balkan war.jpg|thumb|Serbian propaganda poster, depicting king Alexander I beating the losing Bulgarian ruler.]]\n\nThe developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n\n*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].\n*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.\n*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances\u2014even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.\n\nThe '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.\n\nAustria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.\n\nFinally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSoviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.\n[[File:Zapleneti turski topovi od strana na srpskata vojska pred crkata vo Kumanovo, Balkanska vojna, 1912.tif|thumb|Captured Turkish cannons by the Serbian army, displayed in front of a church in [[Kumanovo]], 1912]]\n\n==All Balkan War conflicts==\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They managed to liberate and gain by conquest territories that were inhabited by Greeks since the ancient times and were doouble the size of that time Greek Kingdom. The Greek Army, very little in numbers and ill-equipped in comparison to the superior Ottoman but also Bulgarian and Serbian armies, won very important battles that made it accountable to the Great Powers' chessplay. Two great personalities rose in the Greek political arena, Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], the leading mind behind the Greek foreign policy, and Crown Prince, and later King, [[Konstantinos I]], the major General of the greek Army.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2(History of the Hellenic Nation) |date=1974 |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon |location=Athens, Greece |isbn=9789602131107 |edition=Vol. 14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mavrogordatos |first1=Georgios |title=1915, \u039f \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (1915, The National Division) |date=2015 |publisher=Ekdoseis Patakis |location=Athens |isbn=9789601664989 |pages=33-35 |edition=VIII}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[International relations (1814\u20131919)]]\n\nSince the area has been referred to as the [[Balkans]], notable conflicts have included the following:\n\n*The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]\n*The [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885)\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1910]]\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1911]]\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]]\n*The [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)]]\n*The [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)]]\n*The [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991\u20131999)\n*[[Destruction of the Thracian Bulgarians in 1913]]\n*[[List of places burned during the Balkan Wars]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

place in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912, these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The [[First Balkan War]] began on 8 October 1912, when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire, and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913, when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its loss of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], attacked its former Balkan League allies. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with and invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911\u20131918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]\n\n[[File:Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war. They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in 1914.]]\n\n[[File:Meurtre de Nazim Pacha illustration, 9 February 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], the chief of staff of the Ottoman army, was assassinated by [[Young Turks]] due to his failure.]]\nThe background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].\n\nThe First Balkan War had some main causes briefly presented below:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}<ref>{{cite book |title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2(History of the Hellenic Nation) |date=1974 |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon |location=Athens, Greece |isbn=9789602131107 |edition=Vol. 14}}</ref>\n\n# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.\n# The Italo-Ottoman war of 1911 and the muslims' rebelions of Kosovo and Albania showed that the Empire was deeply \"wounded\" and unable to strike back against another war.\n# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.\n# The christian populations of the european part of the Ottoman Empire were siverelly oppressed by the Ottoman Reign, and thus the Balkan States were forced to take action.\n# Most importantly, the Balkan League was formed, and its members were confident that under those circumstancies an organised and simultaneous declaration of war to the Ottoman Empire would be the only way to protect their compatriots and expand their territories in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\n===Policies of the Great Powers===\nThroughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Israel]]).\n\n[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.\n\n===Young Turk Revolution===\n{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}\nThe 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.\n\n===Reaction in the Balkan States===\n\nSerbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).\n\nOn 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online</ref>\n\nBulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 }}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.\n\n===Balkan League===\n{{Main|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]\n\nFollowing the Italian victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912 and a series of three revolts in Ottoman held Albania the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.\n\nWith the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.\n\nMontenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.\n\nThis alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable to all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.\n\n==First Balkan War==\n{{Main|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]\n\nThe three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three-quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.\n\nMontenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[\u00c7atalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait. On 7 November, in response to an Ottoman initiative, they entered into negotiations for the surrender of [[Thessaloniki]]. With the Greeks already there, and the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division moving swiftly from the north towards Thessaloniki, Hassan Tahsin Pasha considered his position to be hopeless. {{sfn|Hall|2000|p=61}}. The Greeks offered more attractive terms than the Bulgarians did. On 8th November, Tahsin Pasha agreed to terms and 26,000 Ottoman troops passed over into Greek captivity. Before the Greeks entered the city, a German warship whisked the former sultan Abdul Hamid out of Thessaloniki to continue his exile, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. With their army in Thessaloniki, the Greeks took new positions to the east and northeast, including [[Nigrita]]. On 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) Greece expanded its occupied area and teamed up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref>\n\nOn the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}\n\nIn January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the \u00c7atalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.\n\n==Second Balkan War==\n{{Main|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]]\n\nThough the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.\n\nWhen the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be an 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedea\u011fa\u00e7 (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.\n\nGreece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace\u2014and confirming Greek concerns\u2014Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.\n\nSimilarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).\n\nThe Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties,{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}\n\nOn 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web| date= Winter 1995| url= http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| title= THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA| publisher= Magazine: Australia &World Affairs| accessdate= 15 April 2008| last= George Phillipov| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometers away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.\n\nThe Greek army was also successful.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} {{Better citation needed|reason= False citation/page 117 is wrong|date=April 2020}} It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment.

Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis\u2013Lachanas]]]]\nBy 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.\n\nRomania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} from the center of [[Sofia]].\n\nSeeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==\n[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:Serbian poster celebrating victory over Bulgarina in the second Balkan war.jpg|thumb|Serbian propaganda poster, depicting king Alexander I beating the losing Bulgarian ruler.]]\n\nThe developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n\n*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].\n*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.\n*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances\u2014even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.\n\nThe '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.\n\nAustria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.\n\nFinally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSoviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.\n[[File:Zapleneti turski topovi od strana na srpskata vojska pred crkata vo Kumanovo, Balkanska vojna, 1912.tif|thumb|Captured Turkish cannons by the Serbian army, displayed in front of a church in [[Kumanovo]], 1912]]\n\n==All Balkan War conflicts==\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They managed to liberate and gain by conquest territories that were inhabited by Greeks since the ancient times and were doouble the size of that time Greek Kingdom. The Greek Army, very little in numbers and ill-equipped in comparison to the superior Ottoman but also Bulgarian and Serbian armies, won very important battles that made it accountable to the Great Powers' chessplay. Two great personalities rose in the Greek political arena, Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], the leading mind behind the Greek foreign policy, and Crown Prince, and later King, [[Konstantinos I]], the major General of the greek Army.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2(History of the Hellenic Nation) |date=1974 |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon |location=Athens, Greece |isbn=9789602131107 |edition=Vol. 14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mavrogordatos |first1=Georgios |title=1915, \u039f \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (1915, The National Division) |date=2015 |publisher=Ekdoseis Patakis |location=Athens |isbn=9789601664989 |pages=33-35 |edition=VIII}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[International relations (1814\u20131919)]]\n\nSince the area has been referred to as the [[Balkans]], notable conflicts have included the following:\n\n*The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]\n*The [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885)\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1910]]\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1911]]\n*The [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]]\n*The [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)]]\n*The [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)]]\n*The [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991\u20131999)\n*[[Destruction of the Thracian Bulgarians in 1913]]\n*[[List of places burned during the Balkan Wars]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

One of these structures is the [[Hotel Arbez]], in which the dining hall and other rooms are bisected by the border.\n\n==History==\nUntil 1862, La Cure was entirely in France.  France and Switzerland had previously disputed possession of the strategically important Vall\u00e9e des Dappes, which was controlled by the latter until in 1862, the Swiss accepted an offer to exchange that territory for another piece just to the north and east; the new boundary was drawn directly through La Cure.  According to the [[Treaty of Dappes]], which formalized the swap, any buildings existing at the time that the new line was demarcated were not to be disturbed, even if the boundary bisected them.<ref>[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/chfr/La_Cure/index.html La Cure Photos and Maps]</ref>\n\nToday, the border passes through the Hotel Arbez (see below); in addition, it bisects at least two residences, and a [[pub]].<ref>[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/chfr/La_Cure/index.html La Cure Photos and Maps]</ref>\n\n==Railway==\nThere is a Swiss Railways narrow gauge railway line, the [[Nyon\u2013St-Cergue\u2013Morez Railway]], that runs from Nyon to La Cure.\n\n==Hotel Arbez==\nTaking advantage of the delay between negotiation of the treaty and its final ratification by the [[Swiss Parliament]], a local businessman named Ponthus constructed a new structure in 1863 on the new borderline.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref>  Originally Ponthus operated a [[grocery store]] in the Swiss section of the building, with a bar in the French section, hoping to turn the cross-border business to his advantage.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref> In 1921, Jules-Jean Arbez purchased the building, and turned it into a hotel.\n\n[[File:Plaque fronti\u00e8re - La Cure.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Border plaque on a building in La Cure]]\n[[File:La-Cure-1.JPG|thumb|280px|La Cure, aerial view.]]\nToday, the Franco-Swiss border passes through the kitchen, dining room, hallway and several rooms of the hotel.

Since the stairway to the upper floor started in French territory but ended in Switzerland, the Germans were not permitted to access any of the upper rooms, which became a refuge for refugees and [[French Resistance]] members.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref>  The hotel was chosen in 1962 for negotiation of the [[\u00c9vian Accords]] between France and [[Algeria]], which resulted in the independence of the latter.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Haskell Free Library and Opera House]], a library located half in [[Derby Line, Vermont]], United States and half in [[Stanstead, Quebec]], Canada.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Commons category|La Cure}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.arbezie-hotel.com/ Hotel Arbez].

According to the [[Treaty of Dappes]], which formalized the swap, any buildings existing at the time that the new line was demarcated were not to be disturbed, even if the boundary bisected them.<ref>[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/chfr/La_Cure/index.html La Cure Photos and Maps]</ref>\n\nToday, the border passes through the Hotel Arbez (see below); in addition, it bisects at least two residences, and a [[pub]].<ref>[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/borders/chfr/La_Cure/index.html La Cure Photos and Maps]</ref>\n\n==Railway==\nThere is a Swiss Railways narrow gauge railway line, the [[Nyon\u2013St-Cergue\u2013Morez Railway]], that runs from Nyon to La Cure.\n\n==Hotel Arbez==\nTaking advantage of the delay between negotiation of the treaty and its final ratification by the [[Swiss Parliament]], a local businessman named Ponthus constructed a new structure in 1863 on the new borderline.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref>  Originally Ponthus operated a [[grocery store]] in the Swiss section of the building, with a bar in the French section, hoping to turn the cross-border business to his advantage.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref> In 1921, Jules-Jean Arbez purchased the building, and turned it into a hotel.\n\n[[File:Plaque fronti\u00e8re - La Cure.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Border plaque on a building in La Cure]]\n[[File:La-Cure-1.JPG|thumb|280px|La Cure, aerial view.]]\nToday, the Franco-Swiss border passes through the kitchen, dining room, hallway and several rooms of the hotel.  In two rooms (including the [[suite (hotel)|honeymoon suite]]) the beds themselves are bisected by the boundary, while in another, the bathroom is in France, while the rest of the room is in Switzerland.<ref>[http://www.amusingplanet.com/2012/03/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse-located-half.html Hotel Arbez]</ref><ref>[http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/hotel-arbez-franco-suisse.html My Switzerland: Hotel Arbez]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in [[World War II]], their troops were allowed to enter the French side of the hotel, but were strictly prohibited from crossing to the Swiss side.

The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that fair working conditions including wages are key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions.

In 1898 [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] published ''[[Women and Economics]].'' This book argued for paid housework 74 years before the International Wages for Housework Campaign was founded as well as arguing to expand the definition of women in the home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Economics: A Study of the Economic Relation Between Men and Women as a Factor in Social Evolution|last=Perkins Gilman|first=Charlotte|publisher=Small, Maynard & Company|year=1898|isbn=|location=United States|pages=}}</ref> She asserts that \"wives, as earners through domestic service, are entitled to the wages of cooks, housemaids, nursemaids, seamstresses, or housekeepers\" and that providing women economic independence is key to their liberation.

The idea here is that since housework has become less labor intensive since then, it is even less fulfilling than ever before. This echos a similar argument made by [[Alva Myrdal]].\n\n==Recent history==\nThe demands of the Wages for Housework Campaign have been applied to many more recent debates in the gendered aspects of labor including, reproductive rights, sex work, and demands for women in leadership roles in business.<ref name=\"nplusonemag.com\" />\n\nSilvia Federici and several others from the early campaign have continued to publish books and articles related to the demands of Wages for Housework including: ''Revolution at Point Zero: Housework, Reproduction, and Feminist Struggle'' (2012), ''Wages for Housework: The New York Committee 1972\u20131977, History, Theory, and Documents'' (2017).\n\nThe Wages for Housework Campaign called for a [[Global Women's Strike|Global Women\u2019s Strike]] (GWS) on March 8, 2000, demanding among other things, \u201cPayment for all caring work \u2013 in wages, pensions, land and other resources.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=James|first=Selma|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest|title=Decades after Iceland\u2019s \u2018day off\u2019, our women\u2019s strike is stronger than ever {{!}} Selma James|date=2018-03-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Women from over 60 countries around the world participated in the protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/07/gender|title=Stop the world and change it: the global women's strike|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=2000-03-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Since 2000 the GWS network has continued the call for a living wage for women and other caregivers, and they have led or joined campaigns focused on pay equity, violence against women, and the rights of sex workers, among other issues.\n\nIn 2019 the Global Women\u2019s Strike (GWS) network and Wages for Housework Campaign joined a coalition of organizations calling for a Green New Deal for Europe (GNDE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gndforeurope.com/|title=Green New Deal for Europe|website=Green New Deal for Europe|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Wages for Housework Campaign co-founder, [[Selma James]] (with other GWS members), contributed to the GNDE platform report which includes a policy recommendation to \"fund a care income to compensate unpaid activities like care for people, the urban environment, and the natural world.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://report.gndforeurope.com/|title=A Blueprint for Europe's Just Transition|website=Green New Deal for Europe|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> The idea of a \u201ccare income\u201d expands the original demand for wages for housework to include all indispensable yet unpaid (or underpaid) work that involves caring for people and the planet, or caring for life. \n\nOn April 9, 2020, in response to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19 coronavirus]] pandemic and the climate emergency, the Global Women\u2019s Strike and Women of Colour GWS networks released an open letter to governments amplifying their call for a \u201ccare income.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalwomenstrike.net/press-statement-in-response-to-covid-19-and-the-climate-emergency-organizations-around-the-world-call-for-a-care-income-now/|title=PRESS STATEMENT: In response to Covid-19 and the climate emergency: organizations around the world call for a Care Income Now! \u2013 GLOBAL WOMEN'S STRIKE / WAGES FOR HOUSEWORK / SELMA JAMES|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nCritics have argued that providing wages for housework could further reinforce or institutionalize specific gendered roles vis-\u00e0-vis housework, and care work more broadly. Rather than providing wages for housework, they argue, the goal should be liberation from it and the demeaning and subordinating role of 'housewife'. Instead feminists should focus on increasing women\u2019s opportunities in the paid workforce with pay equity, while promoting a more equal distribution of unpaid work in the household. Proponents of Wages for Housework also support equal opportunity and pay equity, however, they argue that entering the workforce does nothing to directly challenge the social role of women or result in a more equitable distribution of unpaid care work in the household. In fact, more often than not, women who have entered the paid workforce often face a \u201cdouble shift\u201d of work, the first paid work in the labor market and the second unpaid housework.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federici, Silvia, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1129596584|title=Revolution at point zero : housework, reproduction, and feminist struggle|isbn=978-1-77113-494-1|oclc=1129596584}}</ref> According to one global estimate, women spend 4.5 hours of unpaid work per day, twice as many hours as men do on average.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gupta|first=Alisha Haridasani|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/unpaid-work-economy-davos.html|title=Women, Burdened With Unpaid Labor, Bear Brunt of Global Inequality|date=2020-01-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOther criticisms include the concern that providing wages for housework would commodify intimate human relationships of love and care and would subsume them into capitalist relations. However, proponents of wages for housework contest this \u201creductive view\u201d of their proposal. For instance, according to [[Silvia Federici]] the demand for wages for housework is not just about remuneration for unpaid work or women\u2019s financial empowerment and independence. Rather, it is a political perspective and a revolutionary strategy to make invisible work more visible, to demystify and disrupt the structural reliance of capitalism on the unpaid work of (mostly) women, and to subvert the supposed natural social role of \u201chousewife\u201d that capital has invented for women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federici, Silvia, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1129596584|title=Revolution at point zero : housework, reproduction, and feminist struggle|isbn=978-1-77113-494-1|oclc=1129596584}}</ref>\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the payment of wages for housework would mean that capital would have to pay for the immense amount of unpaid care work (undertaken largely by women) that currently reproduces the labor force. According to a report by Oxfam and the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, the monetary value of unpaid care work is estimated at nearly $11 trillion a year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wezerek|first=Gus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/04/opinion/women-unpaid-labor.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor is Worth $10,900,000,000,000|date=2020-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Ghodsee|first2=Kristen R.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/time-care/|title=Time to Care|website=www.oxfamamerica.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> This amounts to an enormous subsidy to the capitalist economy, and paying for it would likely render the current system uneconomic, subverting the social relations in the process. \n\nMonetary estimates of this kind are used to demonstrate the scale of unpaid work in relation to more visible waged work. However, proponents of wages for housework do not advocate for the marketization and commodification of unpaid care work. Instead they have promoted public funding for these schemes as part of a larger project of recognizing and revaluing the indispensable role of unpaid care work for society and the economy. Some feminist scholars have also called for the creation of new commons-based systems of care and basic provisioning that operate outside of the market and state, and for the defense of existing commons, especially in communities of the [[Global South]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/feminism-and-politics-commons|title=Feminism and the Politics of the Commons {{!}} The Wealth of the Commons|website=wealthofthecommons.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n* [[Louise Toupin]].

The Campaign's platform included the women's right to work outside of the home, [[Unemployment benefits in Italy|unemployment benefits]], parental leave, and equal pay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdallacosta1.htm|title=The door to the garden|last=www.generation-online.org|first=Mariarosa Dalla Costa + EE + AB|website=www.generation-online.org|access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"nplusonemag.com\" /> The Campaign was formed in [[Padua]], Italy by [[Selma James]], [[Brigitte Galtier]], [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]], and [[Silvia Federici]].

The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that fair working conditions including wages are key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions. The Wages for Housework campaign applied also shared discussions about the [[social factory]] with [[operaismo]]; whereby \"the whole of society lives as a function of the factory and the factory extends its exclusive domination to the whole of society\".<ref name=\"F&S\">{{cite web|last1=Tronti|first1=Mario|title=Factory and Society|url=https://operaismoinenglish.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/factory-and-society/|website=Operaismo in English|accessdate=6 May 2017|date=1962}}</ref> The campaign activities included student protests, community workshops, and direct action protest. \n\nWages for Housework published a [[autonomist Marxism|Marxist autonomist]] journal, ''Mat\u00e9riaux pour l\u2019intervention''.

In 1898 [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] published ''[[Women and Economics]].'' This book argued for paid housework 74 years before the International Wages for Housework Campaign was founded as well as arguing to expand the definition of women in the home.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Economics: A Study of the Economic Relation Between Men and Women as a Factor in Social Evolution|last=Perkins Gilman|first=Charlotte|publisher=Small, Maynard & Company|year=1898|isbn=|location=United States|pages=}}</ref> She asserts that \"wives, as earners through domestic service, are entitled to the wages of cooks, housemaids, nursemaids, seamstresses, or housekeepers\" and that providing women economic independence is key to their liberation. [[Alva Myrdal]], a Swedish feminist, focused on state sponsored child care and housing, in order to ease the burden of parenting off mothers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Essential Feminist Reader|last=Freedman|first=Estelle|publisher=Modern Library|year=2007|isbn=9780812974607|location=|pages=}}</ref> In [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]],'' in which de Beauvoir asserts that women cannot find transcendence through unpaid house work.<ref name=\":4\" /> This idea is echoed in ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' by [[Betty Friedan]] when she discusses how women are unable to feel fulfilled in the home. ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' defined many second wave feminist goals, and the connection between the Wages for Housework Campaign and this work cannot be overlooked.<ref name=\":4\" />    \n\nIn 1965 Alison Ravetz published \"Modern Technology and an Ancient Occupation: Housework in Present-Day Society\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Modern Technology and an Ancient Occupation: Housework in Present-Day Society|journal = Technology and Culture|volume = 6|issue = 2|pages = 256\u2013260|last=Ravetz|first=Alison|jstor = 3101078|year = 1965|doi = 10.2307/3101078}}</ref> which critiques housework being a womanly duty post industrial revolution. The idea here is that since housework has become less labor intensive since then, it is even less fulfilling than ever before. This echos a similar argument made by [[Alva Myrdal]].\n\n==Recent history==\nThe demands of the Wages for Housework Campaign have been applied to many more recent debates in the gendered aspects of labor including, reproductive rights, sex work, and demands for women in leadership roles in business.<ref name=\"nplusonemag.com\" />\n\nSilvia Federici and several others from the early campaign have continued to publish books and articles related to the demands of Wages for Housework including: ''Revolution at Point Zero: Housework, Reproduction, and Feminist Struggle'' (2012), ''Wages for Housework: The New York Committee 1972\u20131977, History, Theory, and Documents'' (2017).\n\nThe Wages for Housework Campaign called for a [[Global Women's Strike|Global Women\u2019s Strike]] (GWS) on March 8, 2000, demanding among other things, \u201cPayment for all caring work \u2013 in wages, pensions, land and other resources.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=James|first=Selma|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest|title=Decades after Iceland\u2019s \u2018day off\u2019, our women\u2019s strike is stronger than ever {{!}} Selma James|date=2018-03-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Women from over 60 countries around the world participated in the protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/07/gender|title=Stop the world and change it: the global women's strike|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=2000-03-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Since 2000 the GWS network has continued the call for a living wage for women and other caregivers, and they have led or joined campaigns focused on pay equity, violence against women, and the rights of sex workers, among other issues.\n\nIn 2019 the Global Women\u2019s Strike (GWS) network and Wages for Housework Campaign joined a coalition of organizations calling for a Green New Deal for Europe (GNDE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gndforeurope.com/|title=Green New Deal for Europe|website=Green New Deal for Europe|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Wages for Housework Campaign co-founder, [[Selma James]] (with other GWS members), contributed to the GNDE platform report which includes a policy recommendation to \"fund a care income to compensate unpaid activities like care for people, the urban environment, and the natural world.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://report.gndforeurope.com/|title=A Blueprint for Europe's Just Transition|website=Green New Deal for Europe|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> The idea of a \u201ccare income\u201d expands the original demand for wages for housework to include all indispensable yet unpaid (or underpaid) work that involves caring for people and the planet, or caring for life. \n\nOn April 9, 2020, in response to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19 coronavirus]] pandemic and the climate emergency, the Global Women\u2019s Strike and Women of Colour GWS networks released an open letter to governments amplifying their call for a \u201ccare income.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalwomenstrike.net/press-statement-in-response-to-covid-19-and-the-climate-emergency-organizations-around-the-world-call-for-a-care-income-now/|title=PRESS STATEMENT: In response to Covid-19 and the climate emergency: organizations around the world call for a Care Income Now! \u2013 GLOBAL WOMEN'S STRIKE / WAGES FOR HOUSEWORK / SELMA JAMES|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nCritics of the Wages for Housework Campaign have argued that it could further reinforce or institutionalize specific gendered roles vis-\u00e0-vis housework, and care work more broadly. Instead they argue that feminists should focus on increasing women\u2019s opportunities in the paid workforce with pay equity, while promoting a more equal distribution of unpaid work in the household. Proponents of Wages for Housework do not oppose these ideas, however, they argue that entering the workforce does nothing to directly challenge the social role of women or result in a more equitable distribution of unpaid care work in the household. In fact, more often than not, women who have entered the paid workforce often face a \u201cdouble shift\u201d of work, the first paid work in the labor market and the second unpaid housework.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federici, Silvia, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1129596584|title=Revolution at point zero : housework, reproduction, and feminist struggle|isbn=978-1-77113-494-1|oclc=1129596584}}</ref> According to one global estimate, women spend 4.5 hours of unpaid work per day, twice as many hours as men do on average.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gupta|first=Alisha Haridasani|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/us/unpaid-work-economy-davos.html|title=Women, Burdened With Unpaid Labor, Bear Brunt of Global Inequality|date=2020-01-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOther criticisms include the concern that providing wages for housework would commodify intimate human relationships of love and care and would subsume them into capitalist relations. However, proponents of wages for housework contest this \u201creductive view\u201d of their proposal. For instance, according to [[Silvia Federici]] the demand for wages for housework is not just about remuneration for unpaid work or women\u2019s financial empowerment and independence. Rather, it is a political perspective and a revolutionary strategy to make invisible work more visible, to demystify and disrupt the structural reliance of capitalism on the unpaid work of (mostly) women, and to subvert the supposed natural social role of \u201chousewife\u201d that capital has invented for women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federici, Silvia, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1129596584|title=Revolution at point zero : housework, reproduction, and feminist struggle|isbn=978-1-77113-494-1|oclc=1129596584}}</ref>\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the payment of wages for housework would mean that capital would have to pay for the immense amount of unpaid care work (undertaken largely by women) that currently reproduces the labor force. According to a report by Oxfam and the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, the monetary value of unpaid care work is estimated at nearly $11 trillion a year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wezerek|first=Gus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/04/opinion/women-unpaid-labor.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor is Worth $10,900,000,000,000|date=2020-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Ghodsee|first2=Kristen R.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/time-care/|title=Time to Care|website=www.oxfamamerica.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> This amounts to an enormous subsidy to the capitalist economy, and paying for it would likely render the current system uneconomic, subverting the social relations in the process. \n\nMonetary estimates of this kind are used to demonstrate the scale of unpaid work in relation to more visible waged work.
