The study of the truths revealed by reason is called [[natural theology]].  During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], especially in Britain and France, philosophers began to reject revelation as a source of knowledge and to appeal only to truths that they felt could be established by reason alone.  Such philosophers were called \"deists\" and the philosophical position that they advocated is called \"deism\".  \n\nDeism as a distinct intellectual movement declined toward the end of the 18th century.  Some of its tenets continued to live on as part of other intellectual movements (e.g. [[Unitarianism]]) and it continues to have some advocates today.\n\n==Enlightenment deism ==\n\n===Origin of the word \"deism\" ===\nThe words ''deism'' and ''[[theism]]'' are both derived from words meaning \"god\": Latin ''deus'' and Greek ''theos'' (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2).  The word ''d\u00e9iste'' first appears in French in 1564 in a work by a Swiss [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] named [[Pierre Viret]]<ref>Viret described deism as a heretical development of Italian Renaissance naturalism, resulting from misuse of the liberty conferred by the Reformation to criticise idolatry and superstition.{{cite book \n    | last=           Viret\n    | first=           Pierre\n    | authorlink= Pierre Viret\n    | title=           Instruction Chr\u00e9tienne en la doctrine de la foi et de l'\u00c9vangile (Christian teaching on the doctrine of faith and the Gospel)\n    | date=          1564\n}}\nViret wrote that a group of people believed, like the Jews and Turks, in a God of some kind - but regarded the doctrine of the evangelists and the apostles as a mere myth.  Contrary to their own claim, he regarded them as atheists.</ref> but was generally unknown in France until the 1690s when [[Pierre Bayle]] published his famous [[Dictionnaire_Historique_et_Critique|Dictionary]], which contained an article on Viret.<ref>\n{{cite book\n    | last1 =                    Bayle\n    | first1 =                   Pierre\n    | author-link1 =        Pierre Bayle\n    | orig-year =\n    | chapter =               Viret\n    | title =                     Dictionnaire historique et critique\n    | url =                       https://books.google.com/books?id=pHAHjxIW7uEC\n    | language =             fr\n    | volume =               14\n    | edition =                Nouvelle\n    | location =              Paris\n    | publisher =            Desoer\n    | page =\n    | access-date =         2017-11-23\n| year = 1820\n }} (1697/1820)            \nBayle quotes Viret (see below) as follows: \u201cJ'ai entendu qu'il y en a de ceste bande, qui s'appellent d\u00e9istes, d'un mot tout nouveau, lequel ils veulent opposer \u00e0 l'ath\u00e9iste,\u201d remarking on the term as a neologism (''un mot tout nouveau'').  (p.418)</ref>   \n\nIn English the words \"deist\" and \"theist\" were originally synonymous, but by the 17th century the terms started to diverge in meaning.<ref>{{cite book\n    |last=          Orr\n    |first=          John\n    |title=          English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits\n    |publisher= Eerdmans\n    |year=         1934\n}}                    The words deism and theism are both derived words meaning \"god\" - \"THE\": Latin ZEUS-deus /\"deist\" and Greek theos/ \"theist\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2). The word deus/d\u00e9iste first appears in French in 1564 in a work by a Swiss Calvinist named Pierre Viret, but was generally unknown in France until the 1690s when Pierre Bayle published his famous Dictionary, which contained an article on Viret.\u201cPrior to the 17th Century the terms [\"deism\" and \"deist\"] were used interchangeably with the terms \"theism\" and \"theist\", respectively. .. Theologians and philosophers of the 17th Century began to give a different signification to the words. .. Both [theists and deists] asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator. .. But the theist taught that God remained actively interested in and operative in the world which he had made, whereas the Deist maintained that God endowed the world at creation with self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then surrendered it wholly to the operation of these powers acting as second causes.\u201d  (p.13)</ref>   The term ''deist'' with its current meaning first appears in English in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621).\n\n===Overview of Enlightenment deism ===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unrefsec|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\nAt least since [[Thomas Aquinas]], Christian thought had recognized two valid sources of religious knowledge: divine revelation and natural reason (\"natural theology\").  During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some thinkers continued to accept reason, along with features of the natural world, as a valid source of religious knowledge, but they rejected the validity of revelation.  These thinkers were the \"deists\" and the word \"deism\" refers to their collective attack on the idea of divine revelation.  \n\nIn effect, deist authors carried out an intellectual war against the idea of revelation.  It was a guerilla war in the sense that deist authors operated independently and each author carried out his attacks in his own unique way.  Some deist authors attacked with calm logic, while others furiously attacked with moral indignation; some appealed to the facts of history while others wielded pointed humor and sarcasm.  These authors exhibited a similarly wide variety of opinions when it came to matters of natural theology.  Some believed in the immortality of the soul, posthumous punishment for the wicked, and posthumous rewards for the virtuous; others did not; some were undecided.  After [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published his discoveries, some regarded God as a watch-maker; a distant Creator and First Mover who wound up the universe, set it in motion, and then stepped away; it was pointless to pray to such a God who surely wasn't listening.  Others felt a closer connection to God and believed that God heard and responded to their prayers.  Those who believed in a watch-maker God rejected the possibility of miracles&mdash; after having established natural laws and set the great cosmos in motion, God didn't need to keep tinkering with his creation.  Others accepted the possibility of miracles; God after all was all-powerful and could do anything at all, including temporarily bypassing his own natural laws.\n\nThe deists were also animated by a variety of different motives (which at least partially explains the diversity of their concerns and conclusions).  This was the age of the [[Scientific Revolution]]; some were animated by a new-found respect for science (\"natural philosophy\") accompanied by a repugnance for superstition, irrationality, and nonsense.  Some were saddened and repulsed by the savage religious wars that had been ravaging Europe for decades; their goal was to find a way to stop the fighting.  Others were pushing back against the crushing political power possessed by the organized Churches in their respective countries, churches that forbade them from thinking freely, censored them if they tried to publish their thoughts, and (if they could be caught) punished them when they succeeded in publishing.\n\nDetails of the deist war on revelation can be found in the article on [[Deism in England and France in the 18th century]].  Here we will look at only a few representative deists, in order to show how they illustrate the many personal facets of deism.\n\n===Herbert of Cherbury and early English deism ===\n[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Isaac Oliver.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, portrait by [[Isaac Oliver]] (1560\u20131617)]]The first major statement of deism in English is [[Lord Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury's]] book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (1624).<ref> Basil Willey, ''The Seventeenth Century Background: Studies in the Thought of the Age in Relation to Poetry and Religion'', 1934, p.59ff.</ref>  Herbert, like his contemporary [[Descartes]], searched for the foundations of knowledge. The first two-thirds of his book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (''On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') are devoted to an exposition of Herbert's [[Epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. Herbert distinguished truths obtained through experience and reasoning about experience, from innate truths and from revealed truths. Innate truths are imprinted on our minds, and the evidence that they are so imprinted is that they are universally accepted.  Herbert's term for universally accepted truths was ''notitiae communes''{{spaced ndash}}Common Notions.  When it came to religion, Herbert believed that there were five Common Notions.\n* There is one Supreme God.\n* He ought to be worshipped.\n* Virtue and piety are the chief parts of divine worship.\n* We ought to be sorry for our sins and repent of them\n* Divine goodness doth dispense rewards and punishments both in this life and after it.              \n\nHerbert himself had relatively few followers, and it was not until the 1680s that Herbert found a true successor in [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] (1654\u20131693). <ref>{{\n        Cite book\n            |last=    Gay\n            |title=   (see above)\n        }} \"By utilizing his wide classical learning, Blount demonstrated how to use pagan writers, and pagan ideas, against Christianity. ...

Locke's famous attack on innate ideas in the ''Essay'' effectively destroyed that foundation.  After Locke, deists could no longer appeal to innate ideas as Herbert had done.  Instead, deists were forced to turn to arguments based on experience and nature.  Under the influence of Newton they turned to the [[argument from design]] as the principal argument for the existence of God.<ref>Note that Locke himself was not a deist. He believed in both miracles and revelation.  See Orr, pp.96-99.</ref>\n\nPeter Gay identifies [[John Toland]]'s ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696), and the \"vehement response\" it provoked as the beginning of post-Locke deism.  Among the notable figures, Gay describes Toland and [[Matthew Tindal]] as the best known but as talented publicists rather than philosophers or scholars.  He regards Middleton and [[Anthony Collins]] as contributing more to the substance of debate; in contrast with fringe writers such as [[Thomas Chubb]] and [[Thomas Woolston]].<ref\nname=\"Gay, 1968, pp.9-10\">\n{{Cite book\n    |last=Gay\n    |title=(see above)\n}}  \u201cAmong the Deists, only Anthony Collins (1676\u20131729) could claim much philosophical competence; only Conyers Middleton (1683\u20131750) was a really serious scholar.

While one specialized in abusing priests, another specialized in rhapsodies to nature, and a third specialized in the skeptical reading of sacred documents.

Introduction (James E. Force, 1990): \"[W]hat sets the Deists apart from even their most [[latitudinarian]] Christian contemporaries is their desire to lay aside scriptural revelation as rationally incomprehensible, and thus useless, or even detrimental, to human society and to religion. While there may possibly be exceptions, .. most Deists, especially as the eighteenth century wears on, agree that revealed Scripture is nothing but a joke or \"well-invented flam.\" About mid-century, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], in his historical and analytical account of the movement [''View of the Principal Deistical Writers'' [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008682251] (1754\u20131755)], squarely states that the rejection of revealed Scripture is ''the'' characteristic element of deism, a view further codified by such authorities as [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. .. \"DEISM,\" writes Stephens bluntly, \"is a denial of all reveal'd Religion.\"\u201d</ref> \n* Rejection of the incomprehensible notion of the Trinity and other religious \"mysteries\".\n* Rejection of reports of miracles, prophecies, etc.\n\n====  The origins of religion ====\nA central premise of deism was that the religions of their day were corruptions of an original religion that was pure, natural, simple, and rational.  Humanity lost this original religion when it was subsequently corrupted by \"priests\" who manipulating it for personal gain and for the class interests of the priesthood in general,<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=Champion\n    | first=J.A.I.\n    | title=The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken: The Church of England and its Enemies, 1660-1730\n    | year=2014\n    | publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)\n}} Champion maintains that historical argument was a central component of the deists' defences of what they considered true religion.</ref> and thus encrusted with superstitions and \"mysteries\"{{spaced ndash}}irrational theological doctrines. They referred to this manipulation of religious doctrine as \"priestcraft,\" an intensely derogatory term.<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=  Paine\n    | first= Thomas\n    | title= The Age of Reason\n| title-link= The Age of Reason\n }} \"As priestcraft was always the enemy of knowledge, because priestcraft supports itself by keeping people in delusion and ignorance, it was consistent with its policy to make the acquisition of knowledge a real sin.\" (Part 2, p.129)</ref>\n\nThey declared that laymen were thus kept dependent on the priesthood for information about the requirements for salvation, and baffled by these \"mysteries\" &ndash; giving the priesthood a position of great power, which they worked to maintain and increase.  Deists saw it as their mission to strip away \"priestcraft\" and \"mysteries\".  Tindal, perhaps the most prominent deist writer, claimed that this was the proper original role of the Christian Church.<ref>\u201cIt can't be imputed to any defect in the light of nature that the pagan world ran into idolatry, but to their being entirely governed by priests, who pretended communication with their gods, and to have thence their revelations, which they imposed on the credulous as divine oracles. Whereas the business of the Christian dispensation was to destroy all those traditional revelations, and restore, free from all idolatry, the true primitive and natural religion implanted in mankind from the creation.\u201d ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (XIV), quoted in Waring ''(see above)'', p.163.</ref>\n\nOne implication of this premise was that current-day primitive societies, or societies that existed in the distant past, should have religious beliefs less encrusted with superstitions and closer to those of natural theology.  (This position became less and less plausible as thinkers such as [[David Hume]] began studying the [[Four Dissertations#The Natural History of Religion|natural history of religion]] and suggested that the origins of religion lay not in reason but in the emotions, specifically fear of the unknown.)\n\n====Immortality of the soul====\nDifferent deists had different beliefs about the immortality of the soul, about the existence of Hell and damnation to punish the wicked, and the existence of Heaven to reward the virtuous.    Anthony Collins,<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}}          p.134.</ref> [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Thomas Chubb]], and [[Peter Annet]] were materialists and either denied or doubted the immortality of the soul.<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}}          p.78.</ref>  [[Benjamin Franklin]] believed in reincarnation or resurrection.  Lord Herbert of Cherbury and [[William Wollaston]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}} p.137.</ref> held that souls exist, survive death, and in the afterlife are rewarded or punished by God for their behavior in life. [[Thomas Paine]] believed in the \"probability\" of immortality of the soul.<ref>\n''[[The Age of Reason|Age of Reason]]'', Pt I:  \n{{quote|\n    I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\n}}\nand (in the Recapitulation)\n{{quote|I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content myself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable to me that I shall continue to exist hereafter than that I should have had existence, as I now have, before that existence began.\n}}</ref>\n\n====Prayer and worship ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2019}}\nInfluenced by Newton's cosmology, many deists regarded God as a distant Creator who wound up the universe, set it in motion, and then stepped away.  These deists naturally considered it to be pointless to pray to or worship a God who surely wasn't listening.  Others, however, felt a closer connection to God and believed that God heard and responded to their prayers.\n\n====Miracles and divine providence====\nThe most natural position for deists was to reject all forms of supernaturalism, including the miracle stories in the Bible.  The problem was that the rejection of miracles also seemed to entail the rejection of [[divine providence]] (of God taking a hand in human affairs), something that many deists were inclined to accept.<ref>Most American deists, for example, firmly believed in divine providence. See this article, [[#Deism in the United States|Deism in the United States]].</ref> Those who believed in a watch-maker God rejected the possibility of miracles and divine providence.  They believed that God, after establishing natural laws and setting the cosmos in motion, stepped away.  He didn't need to keep tinkering with his creation, and the suggestion that he did was insulting.<ref>See for instance {{cite book\n    | last=  Paine\n    | first= Thomas\n    | title= The Age of Reason\n| title-link= The Age of Reason\n }}, Part 1.</ref> Others, however, firmly believed in divine providence and so were reluctantly forced to accept at least the possibility of miracle. God was, after all, all-powerful, and He could do whatever he wanted, including temporarily suspending his own natural laws.\n\n====Freedom and necessity====\nEnlightenment thinkers, under the influence of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian science]], tended to view the universe as a vast machine, created and set in motion by a creator being, that continues to operate according to natural law, without any divine intervention. This view naturally led to what was then called [[necessitarianism]]<ref>David Hartley, for example, described himself as \"quite in the necessitarian scheme. See Ferg, Stephen, \"Two Early Works of David Hartley\", ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1981), pp. 173\u201389.</ref> (the modern term is [[determinism]]): the view that everything in the universe \u2013 including human behavior \u2013 is completely causally determined by antecedent circumstances and natural law. (See, for example, [[La Mettrie]]'s [http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Machine/ ''L'Homme machine''].) As a consequence, debates about [[Free will|freedom]] versus \"necessity\" were a regular feature of Enlightenment religious and philosophical discussions. Reflecting the intellectual climate of the time, there were differences among deists about freedom and determinism. Some, such as [[Anthony Collins]], actually were necessitarians.<ref>See for example ''Liberty and Necessity'' (1729).</ref>\n\n===David Hume===\n[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|David Hume]]\nViews differ on whether [[David Hume]] was a deist, an [[atheist]], or something else.<ref>Hume himself was uncomfortable with both terms, and Hume scholar [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] has argued that the best and safest term for Hume's views is ''[[irreligion]]''.\n{{cite encyclopedia\n    |url=                  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/\n    |title=                Hume on Religion\n    |encyclopedia= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n    |year=               2005\n    |first=                Paul\n    |last=                 Russell\n    |authorlink=      Paul Russell (philosopher)\n    |accessdate=     2009-12-17\n}}</ref>  Like the deists, he had no truck with revelation, and his famous essay \"On Miracles\" provided a powerful argument against belief in miracles.  On the other hand, he had no truck with the idea that an appeal to Reason could provide any justification for religion.  In  ''Natural History of Religion'' (1757)  he contends that polytheism, not monotheism, was \"the first and most ancient religion of mankind\" and that the psychological basis of religion is not reason, but fear of the unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n    | last=             Hume\n    | first=            David\n    | authorlink=  David Hume\n    | title=            The Natural History of Religion\n    | year=            1779\n}}  \u201cThe primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist. .. And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.\u201d  (Section XIII)\n</ref> Hume's account of ignorance and fear as the motivations for primitive religious belief was a severe blow to the deist's rosy picture of prelapsarian humanity basking in priestcraft-free innocence.  In Waring's words {{quote|The clear reasonableness of natural religion disappeared before a semi-historical look at what can be known about uncivilized man\u2014 \"a barbarous, necessitous animal,\" as Hume termed him. Natural religion, if by that term one means the actual religious beliefs and practices of uncivilized peoples, was seen to be a fabric of superstitions. Primitive man was no unspoiled philosopher, clearly seeing the truth of one God. And the history of religion was not, as the deists had implied, retrograde; the widespread phenomenon of superstition was caused less by priestly malice than by man's unreason as he confronted his experience.<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=Waring\n    | title=(see above)\n}}</ref>}}\n\n===Deism in the United States===\n[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Thomas Paine]]\nUntil 1776 the (now) United States were colonies of the British empire and Americans, as British subjects, were influenced by and participated in the intellectual life of England and Great Britain.

The study of the truths revealed by reason is called [[natural theology]].  During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], especially in Britain and France, philosophers began to reject revelation as a source of knowledge and to appeal only to truths that they felt could be established by reason alone.  Such philosophers were called \"deists\" and the philosophical position that they advocated is called \"deism\".  \n\nDeism as a distinct intellectual movement declined toward the end of the 18th century.  Some of its tenets continued to live on as part of other intellectual movements (e.g. [[Unitarianism]]) and it continues to have some advocates today.\n\n==Enlightenment deism ==\n\n===Origin of the word \"deism\" ===\nThe words ''deism'' and ''[[theism]]'' are both derived from words meaning \"god\": Latin ''deus'' and Greek ''theos'' (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2).  The word ''d\u00e9iste'' first appears in French in 1564 in a work by a Swiss [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] named [[Pierre Viret]]<ref>Viret described deism as a heretical development of Italian Renaissance naturalism, resulting from misuse of the liberty conferred by the Reformation to criticise idolatry and superstition.{{cite book \n    | last=           Viret\n    | first=           Pierre\n    | authorlink= Pierre Viret\n    | title=           Instruction Chr\u00e9tienne en la doctrine de la foi et de l'\u00c9vangile (Christian teaching on the doctrine of faith and the Gospel)\n    | date=          1564\n}}\nViret wrote that a group of people believed, like the Jews and Turks, in a God of some kind - but regarded the doctrine of the evangelists and the apostles as a mere myth.

(p.418)</ref>   \n\nIn English the words \"deist\" and \"theist\" were originally synonymous, but by the 17th century the terms started to diverge in meaning.<ref>{{cite book\n    |last=          Orr\n    |first=          John\n    |title=          English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits\n    |publisher= Eerdmans\n    |year=         1934\n}}                    The words deism and theism are both derived words meaning \"god\" - \"THE\": Latin ZEUS-deus /\"deist\" and Greek theos/ \"theist\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2).

Theologians and philosophers of the 17th Century began to give a different signification to the words. .. Both [theists and deists] asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator. .. But the theist taught that God remained actively interested in and operative in the world which he had made, whereas the Deist maintained that God endowed the world at creation with self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then surrendered it wholly to the operation of these powers acting as second causes.\u201d  (p.13)</ref>   The term ''deist'' with its current meaning first appears in English in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621).\n\n===Overview of Enlightenment deism ===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unrefsec|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\nAt least since [[Thomas Aquinas]], Christian thought had recognized two valid sources of religious knowledge: divine revelation and natural reason (\"natural theology\").  During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some thinkers continued to accept reason, along with features of the natural world, as a valid source of religious knowledge, but they rejected the validity of revelation.  These thinkers were the \"deists\" and the word \"deism\" refers to their collective attack on the idea of divine revelation.  \n\nIn effect, deist authors carried out an intellectual war against the idea of revelation.  It was a guerilla war in the sense that deist authors operated independently and each author carried out his attacks in his own unique way.  Some deist authors attacked with calm logic, while others furiously attacked with moral indignation; some appealed to the facts of history while others wielded pointed humor and sarcasm.  These authors exhibited a similarly wide variety of opinions when it came to matters of natural theology.  Some believed in the immortality of the soul, posthumous punishment for the wicked, and posthumous rewards for the virtuous; others did not; some were undecided.  After [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published his discoveries, some regarded God as a watch-maker; a distant Creator and First Mover who wound up the universe, set it in motion, and then stepped away; it was pointless to pray to such a God who surely wasn't listening.  Others felt a closer connection to God and believed that God heard and responded to their prayers.  Those who believed in a watch-maker God rejected the possibility of miracles&mdash; after having established natural laws and set the great cosmos in motion, God didn't need to keep tinkering with his creation.  Others accepted the possibility of miracles; God after all was all-powerful and could do anything at all, including temporarily bypassing his own natural laws.\n\nThe deists were also animated by a variety of different motives (which at least partially explains the diversity of their concerns and conclusions).  This was the age of the [[Scientific Revolution]]; some were animated by a new-found respect for science (\"natural philosophy\") accompanied by a repugnance for superstition, irrationality, and nonsense.  Some were saddened and repulsed by the savage religious wars that had been ravaging Europe for decades; their goal was to find a way to stop the fighting.  Others were pushing back against the crushing political power possessed by the organized Churches in their respective countries, churches that forbade them from thinking freely, censored them if they tried to publish their thoughts, and (if they could be caught) punished them when they succeeded in publishing.\n\nDetails of the deist war on revelation can be found in the article on [[Deism in England and France in the 18th century]].  Here we will look at only a few representative deists, in order to show how they illustrate the many personal facets of deism.\n\n===Herbert of Cherbury and early English deism ===\n[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Isaac Oliver.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, portrait by [[Isaac Oliver]] (1560\u20131617)]]The first major statement of deism in English is [[Lord Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury's]] book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (1624).<ref> Basil Willey, ''The Seventeenth Century Background: Studies in the Thought of the Age in Relation to Poetry and Religion'', 1934, p.59ff.</ref>  Herbert, like his contemporary [[Descartes]], searched for the foundations of knowledge. The first two-thirds of his book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (''On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') are devoted to an exposition of Herbert's [[Epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. Herbert distinguished truths obtained through experience and reasoning about experience, from innate truths and from revealed truths. Innate truths are imprinted on our minds, and the evidence that they are so imprinted is that they are universally accepted.  Herbert's term for universally accepted truths was ''notitiae communes''{{spaced ndash}}Common Notions.  When it came to religion, Herbert believed that there were five Common Notions.\n* There is one Supreme God.\n* He ought to be worshipped.\n* Virtue and piety are the chief parts of divine worship.\n* We ought to be sorry for our sins and repent of them\n* Divine goodness doth dispense rewards and punishments both in this life and after it.              \n\nHerbert himself had relatively few followers, and it was not until the 1680s that Herbert found a true successor in [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] (1654\u20131693). <ref>{{\n        Cite book\n            |last=    Gay\n            |title=   (see above)\n        }} \"By utilizing his wide classical learning, Blount demonstrated how to use pagan writers, and pagan ideas, against Christianity. ...

Locke's famous attack on innate ideas in the ''Essay'' effectively destroyed that foundation.  After Locke, deists could no longer appeal to innate ideas as Herbert had done.  Instead, deists were forced to turn to arguments based on experience and nature.  Under the influence of Newton they turned to the [[argument from design]] as the principal argument for the existence of God.<ref>Note that Locke himself was not a deist. He believed in both miracles and revelation.  See Orr, pp.96-99.</ref>\n\nPeter Gay identifies [[John Toland]]'s ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696), and the \"vehement response\" it provoked as the beginning of post-Locke deism.  Among the notable figures, Gay describes Toland and [[Matthew Tindal]] as the best known but as talented publicists rather than philosophers or scholars.

Introduction (James E. Force, 1990): \"[W]hat sets the Deists apart from even their most [[latitudinarian]] Christian contemporaries is their desire to lay aside scriptural revelation as rationally incomprehensible, and thus useless, or even detrimental, to human society and to religion. While there may possibly be exceptions, .. most Deists, especially as the eighteenth century wears on, agree that revealed Scripture is nothing but a joke or \"well-invented flam.\" About mid-century, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], in his historical and analytical account of the movement [''View of the Principal Deistical Writers'' [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008682251] (1754\u20131755)], squarely states that the rejection of revealed Scripture is ''the'' characteristic element of deism, a view further codified by such authorities as [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. .. \"DEISM,\" writes Stephens bluntly, \"is a denial of all reveal'd Religion.\"\u201d</ref> \n* Rejection of the incomprehensible notion of the Trinity and other religious \"mysteries\".\n* Rejection of reports of miracles, prophecies, etc.\n\n====  The origins of religion ====\nA central premise of deism was that the religions of their day were corruptions of an original religion that was pure, natural, simple, and rational.  Humanity lost this original religion when it was subsequently corrupted by \"priests\" who manipulating it for personal gain and for the class interests of the priesthood in general,<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=Champion\n    | first=J.A.I.\n    | title=The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken: The Church of England and its Enemies, 1660-1730\n    | year=2014\n    | publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)\n}} Champion maintains that historical argument was a central component of the deists' defences of what they considered true religion.</ref> and thus encrusted with superstitions and \"mysteries\"{{spaced ndash}}irrational theological doctrines. They referred to this manipulation of religious doctrine as \"priestcraft,\" an intensely derogatory term.<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=  Paine\n    | first= Thomas\n    | title= The Age of Reason\n| title-link= The Age of Reason\n }} \"As priestcraft was always the enemy of knowledge, because priestcraft supports itself by keeping people in delusion and ignorance, it was consistent with its policy to make the acquisition of knowledge a real sin.\" (Part 2, p.129)</ref>\n\nThey declared that laymen were thus kept dependent on the priesthood for information about the requirements for salvation, and baffled by these \"mysteries\" &ndash; giving the priesthood a position of great power, which they worked to maintain and increase.  Deists saw it as their mission to strip away \"priestcraft\" and \"mysteries\".  Tindal, perhaps the most prominent deist writer, claimed that this was the proper original role of the Christian Church.<ref>\u201cIt can't be imputed to any defect in the light of nature that the pagan world ran into idolatry, but to their being entirely governed by priests, who pretended communication with their gods, and to have thence their revelations, which they imposed on the credulous as divine oracles. Whereas the business of the Christian dispensation was to destroy all those traditional revelations, and restore, free from all idolatry, the true primitive and natural religion implanted in mankind from the creation.\u201d ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (XIV), quoted in Waring ''(see above)'', p.163.</ref>\n\nOne implication of this premise was that current-day primitive societies, or societies that existed in the distant past, should have religious beliefs less encrusted with superstitions and closer to those of natural theology.  (This position became less and less plausible as thinkers such as [[David Hume]] began studying the [[Four Dissertations#The Natural History of Religion|natural history of religion]] and suggested that the origins of religion lay not in reason but in the emotions, specifically fear of the unknown.)\n\n====Immortality of the soul====\nDifferent deists had different beliefs about the immortality of the soul, about the existence of Hell and damnation to punish the wicked, and the existence of Heaven to reward the virtuous.    Anthony Collins,<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}}          p.134.</ref> [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Thomas Chubb]], and [[Peter Annet]] were materialists and either denied or doubted the immortality of the soul.<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}}          p.78.</ref>  [[Benjamin Franklin]] believed in reincarnation or resurrection.  Lord Herbert of Cherbury and [[William Wollaston]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n    |last= Orr\n    |title=(see above)\n}} p.137.</ref> held that souls exist, survive death, and in the afterlife are rewarded or punished by God for their behavior in life. [[Thomas Paine]] believed in the \"probability\" of immortality of the soul.<ref>\n''[[The Age of Reason|Age of Reason]]'', Pt I:  \n{{quote|\n    I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\n}}\nand (in the Recapitulation)\n{{quote|I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content myself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable to me that I shall continue to exist hereafter than that I should have had existence, as I now have, before that existence began.\n}}</ref>\n\n====Prayer and worship ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2019}}\nInfluenced by Newton's cosmology, many deists regarded God as a distant Creator who wound up the universe, set it in motion, and then stepped away.  These deists naturally considered it to be pointless to pray to or worship a God who surely wasn't listening.  Others, however, felt a closer connection to God and believed that God heard and responded to their prayers.\n\n====Miracles and divine providence====\nThe most natural position for deists was to reject all forms of supernaturalism, including the miracle stories in the Bible.  The problem was that the rejection of miracles also seemed to entail the rejection of [[divine providence]] (of God taking a hand in human affairs), something that many deists were inclined to accept.<ref>Most American deists, for example, firmly believed in divine providence. See this article, [[#Deism in the United States|Deism in the United States]].</ref> Those who believed in a watch-maker God rejected the possibility of miracles and divine providence.  They believed that God, after establishing natural laws and setting the cosmos in motion, stepped away.  He didn't need to keep tinkering with his creation, and the suggestion that he did was insulting.<ref>See for instance {{cite book\n    | last=  Paine\n    | first= Thomas\n    | title= The Age of Reason\n| title-link= The Age of Reason\n }}, Part 1.</ref> Others, however, firmly believed in divine providence and so were reluctantly forced to accept at least the possibility of miracle. God was, after all, all-powerful, and He could do whatever he wanted, including temporarily suspending his own natural laws.\n\n====Freedom and necessity====\nEnlightenment thinkers, under the influence of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian science]], tended to view the universe as a vast machine, created and set in motion by a creator being, that continues to operate according to natural law, without any divine intervention. This view naturally led to what was then called [[necessitarianism]]<ref>David Hartley, for example, described himself as \"quite in the necessitarian scheme. See Ferg, Stephen, \"Two Early Works of David Hartley\", ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1981), pp. 173\u201389.</ref> (the modern term is [[determinism]]): the view that everything in the universe \u2013 including human behavior \u2013 is completely causally determined by antecedent circumstances and natural law. (See, for example, [[La Mettrie]]'s [http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Machine/ ''L'Homme machine''].) As a consequence, debates about [[Free will|freedom]] versus \"necessity\" were a regular feature of Enlightenment religious and philosophical discussions. Reflecting the intellectual climate of the time, there were differences among deists about freedom and determinism. Some, such as [[Anthony Collins]], actually were necessitarians.<ref>See for example ''Liberty and Necessity'' (1729).</ref>\n\n===David Hume===\n[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|David Hume]]\nViews differ on whether [[David Hume]] was a deist, an [[atheist]], or something else.<ref>Hume himself was uncomfortable with both terms, and Hume scholar [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] has argued that the best and safest term for Hume's views is ''[[irreligion]]''.\n{{cite encyclopedia\n    |url=                  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/\n    |title=                Hume on Religion\n    |encyclopedia= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n    |year=               2005\n    |first=                Paul\n    |last=                 Russell\n    |authorlink=      Paul Russell (philosopher)\n    |accessdate=     2009-12-17\n}}</ref>  Like the deists, he had no truck with revelation, and his famous essay \"On Miracles\" provided a powerful argument against belief in miracles.  On the other hand, he had no truck with the idea that an appeal to Reason could provide any justification for religion.  In  ''Natural History of Religion'' (1757)  he contends that polytheism, not monotheism, was \"the first and most ancient religion of mankind\" and that the psychological basis of religion is not reason, but fear of the unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n    | last=             Hume\n    | first=            David\n    | authorlink=  David Hume\n    | title=            The Natural History of Religion\n    | year=            1779\n}}  \u201cThe primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist. .. And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.\u201d  (Section XIII)\n</ref> Hume's account of ignorance and fear as the motivations for primitive religious belief was a severe blow to the deist's rosy picture of prelapsarian humanity basking in priestcraft-free innocence.  In Waring's words {{quote|The clear reasonableness of natural religion disappeared before a semi-historical look at what can be known about uncivilized man\u2014 \"a barbarous, necessitous animal,\" as Hume termed him. Natural religion, if by that term one means the actual religious beliefs and practices of uncivilized peoples, was seen to be a fabric of superstitions. Primitive man was no unspoiled philosopher, clearly seeing the truth of one God. And the history of religion was not, as the deists had implied, retrograde; the widespread phenomenon of superstition was caused less by priestly malice than by man's unreason as he confronted his experience.<ref>{{cite book\n    | last=Waring\n    | title=(see above)\n}}</ref>}}\n\n===Deism in the United States===\n[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Thomas Paine]]\nUntil 1776 the (now) United States were colonies of the British empire and Americans, as British subjects, were influenced by and participated in the intellectual life of England and Great Britain.
