It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 22, 2003. In it, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] struggles to understand a new [[metrosexual]] fad that has sprung around the men and boys of South Park and is the only one who does not want to conform to it. The episode features a parody of the TV show, ''[[Queer Eye|Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]].

[[Mr. Garrison]] and [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Slave|Mr. Slave]], the town's gay couple, are excited at first but quickly become opposed to the fad when they realize that metrosexuals are straight men imitating gay culture and lifestyle, which Garrison believes is insulting to actual gays. The women of the town are initially in favor of their husbands' improved [[hygiene]] and willingness to communicate, but soon tire of the men becoming increasingly self-absorbed. When the wives confront the men about this, they are accused of being \"metrophobic\" and the men become even more feminine than before.\n\nIn hopes of ending the fad, Kyle, Mr. Garrison, and Mr. Slave go to [[New York City|New York]] to kill the Fab Five, the hosts of \"Queer Eye\". Their mission fails but the Fab Five decide to not press charges. Mr. Garrison then tries to talk the nonchalant gay stars out of selling out gay culture for mere ratings, which only falls on deaf ears.

They explain that men need to be masculine and that is what really makes them attractive, even if they are gross. The ''Queer Eye'' producers are about to press charges on the women until they discover that the Fab Five were not human, noting that the Crab People tried this before with ''[[The Jeffersons]]''.

The history of this station dates back to 1995 as ''The Wireless Station'' broadcasting on 1530 AM and playing music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. ''The Wireless Station'' was started/operated by The Wireless Station Ltd for three years from November 1995 and was then leased or sold to Hawke's Bay Media Group in 1998 and re-branded as ''Goodtime Gold'', playing music from the 1960s and 1970s. In 1999 it was renamed simply ''Gold 1530''.\n\n''Gold 1530'' was leased (or sold) to The Radio Network in 2000 and was re-branded as ''Jammin' Oldies 1530 AM'' or ''JO 1530'' in June 2000. In 2002 the station became the very first station under the Coast brand name and in 2004 Coast began producing their programme from Auckland networked back to Hawke's Bay on 1530 AM (then on 1584 AM from 2011), and later to the rest of New Zealand.<ref name=\"napier\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm |title=The Radio Vault Napier/Hastings |publisher=The Radio Vault |date=2014 |accessdate=October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101824/http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Relaunch===\n\nThe final re-branding of the station was to the current name Coast 1530. In 2004 the station became voice tracked from [[Auckland]] in preparation for its launch in the Auckland market on 26 April 2004. The network expanded beyond Auckland and Hawke's Bay to other markets later in the year.<ref name=\"napier\"/>\n\nThe network rose to third place in the Auckland radio survey ratings in 2006, just two years after it began. Then programme director Mike Regal credited the station's success to serving the [[baby boomer]] gap in the market that had previously been ignored by marketers, advertisers and media companies. He said the station was a fine balancing act between being neither a station for the young or a station for seniors. \"We don't want to be too cool and hip with it and risk alienating people, but on the other side we didn't want to sound too old either,\" he told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]''.\n\nClassic album tracks from the likes of [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] have been a cornerstone of the network's playlist. Regal said tracks might have seemed \"[[Dag (subculture)|daggy]]\" to some people, but they were songs people over 30 years old would know, recognise and sing at a karaoke bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10377683 |title=Sinatra, Springfield help push Coast to No 3 in two years |publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\n\nIn 2011 the original 1530 AM frequency leased by The Radio Network and used to start the first Coast Station in Hawke's Bay was returned to its original owners and is being used to once again broadcast The Wireless Station, with a format of music from the 1930s to the 1970s.<ref name=\"napier\"/>\n\nIn a radio survey in late 2014, Coast recorded more than 105,000 listeners in Auckland each week and a 7.8 percent market share, putting it on the top six highest-rating radio stations in the highly competitive [[List of radio stations in Auckland|Auckland radio market]].

The history of this station dates back to 1995 as ''The Wireless Station'' broadcasting on 1530 AM and playing music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. ''The Wireless Station'' was started/operated by The Wireless Station Ltd for three years from November 1995 and was then leased or sold to Hawke's Bay Media Group in 1998 and re-branded as ''Goodtime Gold'', playing music from the 1960s and 1970s. In 1999 it was renamed simply ''Gold 1530''.\n\n''Gold 1530'' was leased (or sold) to The Radio Network in 2000 and was re-branded as ''Jammin' Oldies 1530 AM'' or ''JO 1530'' in June 2000. In 2002 the station became the very first station under the Coast brand name and in 2004 Coast began producing their programme from Auckland networked back to Hawke's Bay on 1530 AM (then on 1584 AM from 2011), and later to the rest of New Zealand.<ref name=\"napier\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm |title=The Radio Vault Napier/Hastings |publisher=The Radio Vault |date=2014 |accessdate=October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101824/http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Relaunch===\n\nThe final re-branding of the station was to the current name Coast 1530. In 2004 the station became voice tracked from [[Auckland]] in preparation for its launch in the Auckland market on 26 April 2004. The network expanded beyond Auckland and Hawke's Bay to other markets later in the year.<ref name=\"napier\"/>\n\nThe network rose to third place in the Auckland radio survey ratings in 2006, just two years after it began. Then programme director Mike Regal credited the station's success to serving the [[baby boomer]] gap in the market that had previously been ignored by marketers, advertisers and media companies. He said the station was a fine balancing act between being neither a station for the young or a station for seniors. \"We don't want to be too cool and hip with it and risk alienating people, but on the other side we didn't want to sound too old either,\" he told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]''.\n\nClassic album tracks from the likes of [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] have been a cornerstone of the network's playlist. Regal said tracks might have seemed \"[[Dag (subculture)|daggy]]\" to some people, but they were songs people over 30 years old would know, recognise and sing at a karaoke bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10377683 |title=Sinatra, Springfield help push Coast to No 3 in two years |publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\n\nIn 2011 the original 1530 AM frequency leased by The Radio Network and used to start the first Coast Station in Hawke's Bay was returned to its original owners and is being used to once again broadcast The Wireless Station, with a format of music from the 1930s to the 1970s.<ref name=\"napier\"/>\n\nIn a radio survey in late 2014, Coast recorded more than 105,000 listeners in Auckland each week and a 7.8 percent market share, putting it on the top six highest-rating radio stations in the highly competitive [[List of radio stations in Auckland|Auckland radio market]]. The network has been even more successful in the Bay of Plenty, maintaining a number one ratings spot, with 23 thousand listeners and 15 percent market share, since breakfast host Brian Kelly moved from local station [[The Hits (New Zealand)|Classic Hits]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=11337698 |title=Will works his magic over the airwaves |publisher=[[Bay of Plenty Times]] |date=6 October 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2018 and early 2019 Coast migrated to FM in a number of markets where coverage had previously on been only available on AM - including Hawke's Bay, Whangarei, and Taranaki.\n\n==Programmes==\n\n===Coast Breakfast===\nA live network breakfast programme with Jason Reeves and Bernadine Oliver-Kerby commenced in January 2018.

After Newstalk ZB in Hawera changed to frequency 1278 AM, the show was dropped and replaced with the Auckland-based programme, but it was later picked up by Coast.

The McHugh Gymnasium was built in front of Adelphia Hall and opened in 1983, a result of the school's first major fundraising campaign. Funds from this campaign were used to remodel the third floor of Adelphia Hall for improved science facilities.

The  theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment.

The  theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.

The case was first covered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that December, followed by the computer hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] later that month, and the subsequent coverage of the trials in late 2013. The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html|title=CNN, Fox News, MSNBC Air Name of Steubenville Rape Victim|date=March 18, 2013|last=Fung|first=Katherine|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=nyt20121217>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Rape Case Unfolds on Web and Splits City |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2012|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Macur|first2=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSteubenville is located at {{coord|40|21|30|N|80|37|0|W|type:city}} (40.359, \u221280.614).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The city lies along the [[Ohio River]], with the city spreading west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006.
