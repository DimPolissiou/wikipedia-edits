It is located on the east bank of the [[Nile]] in the [[Minya Governorate]], to the south of [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] and almost opposite the city of [[Mallawi]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nDuring the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] it was the chief cemetery of the governors (\"[[nomarch]]s\") of the 15th [[Upper Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]], dating back to the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh]] and [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] Dynasties. The most spectacular of the tombs is that of the ''Great Overlord of [[Hare nome|the Hare (15th) Nome]]'' called [[Djehutihotep]]. He lived during the reigns of [[Amenemhat II]], [[Senusret II]] and [[Senusret III]].\n\nDeir El Bersha [[necropolis]] is near the Nile valley town of Minya, 225&nbsp;km south of Cairo.\n\n== Excavations ==\nIn the spring of 1915, the [[Harvard University]]-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, expedition dug at Bersha. They excavated a tomb (designated number 10A) that belonged to an early Middle Kingdom nomarch named [[Djehutynakht (10A)|Djehutynakht]]. The tomb had been looted, but an enormous collection of wooden models representing scenes of daily life and boats remained. The tomb also contained the extraordinary painted coffins of Djehutynakht and his wife. The grave goods are now in the collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].\n\nIn 2007, the tomb of an Egyptian courtier was found. The tomb belonged to Henu, an estate manager and high-ranking official during the First Intermediate Period, which lasted from 2181 to 2050 BC and was a time of political chaos in ancient Egypt. The archaeologists found Henu's mummy wrapped in linen in a large wooden coffin and a sarcophagus decorated with hieroglyphic texts addressed to the gods [[Anubis]] and [[Osiris]]. The tomb contained well-preserved painted wooden statuettes of workers making bricks, women making beer and pounding cereal, and a model of a boat with rowers, Egyptian media said. (from a 2007-05-21 news article at www.chinaview.cn  )\n\nIn 2019, archaeologists revealed a 4000-year-old ancient Egyptian 'map for the soul' on two wooden panels with a mix of ancient [[hieroglyph]]s and symbols inside a sarcophagus known as the [[Coffin Texts]] at Deir El Bersha.
