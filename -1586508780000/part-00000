The closest larger towns are [[Bielefeld]] (39 kilometres southwest) and [[Hanover]] (80&nbsp;km east).\n\n== History ==\nIn the village of Bergkirchen, which belongs to Bad Oeynhausen, a wellspring sanctuary existed in pre-Christian (Saxon) times at the local crossing of the [[Wiehengebirge]], which was replaced in the 9th century by a church. Today's church is a subsequent building. On the church and the downhill-situated [[Widukind]] spring plates explain this further. A few metres from the church a 13th-century timbered homestead can still be found.\n\nIn 753 [[Pepin the Short]], according to the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], stopped over ''ad locum qui dicitur Rimiae'', so that Rehme is commonly accepted as the oldest part of town. \n\nThe [[origin myth]] of Bad Oeynhausen relates that in 1745 a local farmer named S\u00fcltemeyer noticed that after his pigs had wallowed in nearby mud they had a salty crust on their backs and he decided to investigate the source. After public awareness of this finding, King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] ordered the construction of a saltworks, which was named \"Royal Saline Neusalzwerk\". Today's S\u00fcltemeyer Fountain (colloquial: Pig-Fountain), in the city centre, is a reminder of the city's beginning.\n[[File:S\u00fcltemeier Brunnen.jpg|thumb|The S\u00fcltemeyer-Fountain]]\n[[File:Jordan Sprudel.jpg|thumb|219x219px|The Jordansprudel in September 2015]]\nAfter 1830, mining captain Carl Baron of Oeynhausen (1795\u20131865) oversaw drilling in today's spa garden area in search of salt deposits, but instead found a thermal salt spring in 1845. Quickly the healing abilities of this spring were discovered and first baths were built in the community, which now was called \"Neusalzwerk near Rehme\". In 1848 King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] renamed it to \"Royal Bath (German: Bad) Oeynhausen\", and this name was retained after receiving its own town charter in 1860. \nThe opening of the [[Cologne]]-[[Minden]] railway line in 1849 connected the city with railroad network.\n\nThe growth of spa activities and the town's development continued into World War II. Among other things the Kurpark (spa garden), according to plans by [[Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9]], and the Kurhaus (spa hotel) in 1908 (from 1980-2002 a Casino was located here; today called the Kaiserpalais, it hosts a Variet\u00e9, a noble restaurant and a discoth\u00e8que) were constructed. At the beginning of the 20th century residential houses for the [[bourgeoisie]] were built around the spa garden.\nThe extraordinary conglomeration of different architectural styles of the spa garden's buildings and the surrounding mansons bestowed Bad Oeynhausen the unofficial title \"Museum for the Architecture of the 19th Century\". \nOne of the most famous buildings, the \"Farne-Villa\" was replaced by a new building in 1969.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century additional thermal salt springs were drilled. Among these the ''Jordansprudel'', drilled in 1926, is best known and with a capacity of 6000 l/min and a total height of up to 40 m it is the world's highest carbonated thermal salt spring and de facto the town's landmark.\n\nUnder [[Nazi Germany]], Bad Oeynhausen hosted a synod of the [[Confessing Church]], as well as the home congregation to [[Jakob Emil Karl Koch]], a leading member. The [[World War II]] tank factory of the town was bombed on 30 March 1945.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130602071111/http://www.usaaf.net/chron/45/mar45.htm</ref> Post-war, the town hosted the [[Control Commission for Germany \u2013 British Element|Control Commission for Germany \u2013 British Element (CCG/BE)]], the [[Stratocracy|military government]] for the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#British Zone of Occupation|British Zone of Occupation]] and served as the [[British Army of the Rhine]] headquarters.\n\nThe town was returned to local control in 1954 and spa activities resumed. In 1973, the seven surrounding municipalities Wulferdingsen, Volmerdingsen, Werste, Eidinghaisen, Dehme, Rehme and Lohe of the former \"Amt Rehme\" were merged with Bad Oeynhausen into one commune.{{Specify|what community, and which seven?|date=March 2008}} The \"State-owned Spa Bad Oeynhausen\" ({{lang-de|Staatsbad}}), property of the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], was municipalised in 2004.\n\n== Geography ==\nBad Oeynhausen is located on the west bank of the [[Weser]] river.

It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. A major theme of the season is the characters adapting to change, as all of the fifth-year surgical residents have turned into surgical attendings, and are now teaching interns, and operating on their own surgeries. The early episodes of the season depict the characters dealing with the aftermath of the season eight plane crash that claimed the life of [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) and upon rescue [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), who dies in the first episode. \n\n[[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) finds his surgical career in doubt after badly damaging his hand but ultimately his sister Liz ([[Neve Campbell]]) donates a nerve from her leg and [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) is able to save his hand. Later, Shepherd receives more good news when his wife [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) discovers that she is pregnant, despite her previously being told that it was unlikely that she could conceive. [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) is severely traumatized upon rescue and suffers from [[brief reactive psychosis]] and eventually decides to take up her fellowship in Minnesota, though soon grows unhappy in her new surroundings and returns to Seattle after the death of her friend and mentor, Doctor Thomas. [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) survives the plane crash in spite of her leg injury, but upon return her wound becomes infected and her leg has to be amputated to save her life. Robbins reacts badly to this, becoming bitter and blaming her wife Callie and her former friend [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) and refuses to leave her bed or return to work.\n\nDerek discovers that prior to the plane crash, the hospital had recently changed airlines to one with a poorer safety record for budgetary reasons, resulting in the four crash survivors (Grey, Shepherd, Robbins and Yang) deciding to pursue a lawsuit, and it soon becomes apparent that chief of surgery [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) had given the go-ahead to the change. To prevent the doctors' court case from being thrown out, Hunt decides to divorce Yang, but the two secretly resume their relationship and agree to start again. Despite contemplating a settlement, the doctors decide to continue with the lawsuit and eventually are awarded fifteen million dollars each, but the insurance company discovers an unexpected loophole and refuse to pay, resulting in the hospital itself becoming liable, putting its future in extreme doubt. Dr. Alana Cahill ([[Constance Zimmer]]) is appointed to cut costs at the hospital and she eventually decides the best course of action would be to seek out a new buyer and attracts the interest of a company named Pegasus. Later however, Torres and [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]) discover the unpleasant consequences that would fall upon the hospital should they be taken over by Pegasus prompting the four crash survivors (and Torres on the behalf of Sloan) to pool their money together in a bid to purchase the hospital themselves and quit their jobs, resulting in Pegasus pulling out. The doctors run into trouble when they fail to secure an extra benefactor, but at the last minute Catherine Avery ([[Debbie Allen]]) reveals that the Harper Avery Foundation is willing to provide a majority share in the company, on the condition that they have at least one member on the board of directors. The doctors agree and their purchase is complete, only for Catherine to appoint her son [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]) to part of the board, effectively putting him in charge of the entire hospital.\n\nIn other storylines, [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) marries her partner Ben Warren ([[Jason George]]), despite suffering from last-minute nerves and missing the original wedding ceremony due to Adele Webber ([[Loretta Devine]]) being admitted to the hospital. Adele later dies after her surgery, leaving her husband Richard wracked with guilt due to his relationship with Catherine Avery. A new group of interns arrives at Seattle Grace and soon Karev strikes up a close friendship with Jo Wilson ([[Camilla Luddington]]) but the pair fall short of developing a romance, despite other characters commenting on their chemistry. After failing her board exams in season eight, [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) returns home to Ohio, but is later brought back by Hunt and resumes her job at the hospital. Upon her return, Kepner restarts her sexual relationship with Jackson, despite being filled with conflict due to her religious beliefs. The pair eventually split up when Kepner refuses to make a commitment, and Avery starts dating intern Stephanie Edwards ([[Jerrika Hinton]]), while Kepner starts dating a paramedic named Matthew ([[Justin Bruening]]).\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Grey's Anatomy cast members|List of Grey's Anatomy characters}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as Dr. [[Meredith Grey]] \n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Dr. [[Cristina Yang]]\n* [[Justin Chambers]] as Dr. [[Alex Karev]]\n* [[Chandra Wilson]] as Dr. [[Miranda Bailey]]\n* [[James Pickens Jr.]] as Dr. [[Richard Webber]]\n* [[Sara Ramirez]] as Dr. [[Callie Torres]]\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Dr. [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]]{{efn|Eric Dane is credited as a series regular through 9x02.}}\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Dr. [[Owen Hunt]]\n* [[Jessica Capshaw]] as Dr. [[Arizona Robbins]]\n* [[Sarah Drew]] as Dr. [[April Kepner]]\n* [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] as Dr. [[Jackson Avery]]\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Dr. [[Derek Shepherd]]\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as [[Adele Webber]]\n* [[Constance Zimmer]] as Dr. Alana Cahill\n* [[William Daniels]] as Dr. Craig Thomas\n* [[Debbie Allen]] as Dr. Catherine Avery\n* [[Justin Bruening]] as Paramedic Matthew\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Lizzie Shepherd\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Casey Hedges\n* [[Camilla Luddington]] as Dr. Jo Wilson\n* [[Gaius Charles]] as Dr. Shane Ross\n* [[Jerrika Hinton]] as Dr. [[Stephanie Edwards (Grey's Anatomy)|Stephanie Edwards]]\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as Dr. Heather Brooks\n* [[Tessa Ferrer]] as Dr. Leah Murphy\n* [[Hilarie Burton]] as Dr. Lauren Boswell\n* [[Charles Michael Davis]] as Dr. Jason Myers\n* [[Steven Culp]] as Dr. Darren Parker\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as Stan Grossberg\n* Nicole Cummins as Paramedic Nicole\n{{col-end}}\n;Cast Notes\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Casting===\nIn May 2012, it was announced that six original cast mates, [[Ellen Pompeo]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Sandra Oh]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[Justin Chambers]], and [[James Pickens, Jr.]] had renewed their contracts for another two seasons, as [[Meredith Grey]], [[Derek Shepherd]], [[Cristina Yang]], [[Miranda Bailey]], [[Alex Karev]], and [[Richard Webber]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/05/09/greys-anatomy-stars-ink-new-deals/133289/|title='Grey's Anatomy' Stars Ink New Deals|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV Guide|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> In July 2012, it was announced that cast member [[Eric Dane]] would not be returning to ''Grey's Anatomy'' as a series regular, and would leave after two episodes to give his character a proper ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/07/26/grey-anatomy-eric-dane-leaving/|title=Grey's Anatomy Exclusive: Eric Dane Checks Out!|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|work=TV Guide|date=July 26, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref> In addition, [[Chyler Leigh]] requested to be released from her contract to spend more time with her family and her character was killed off in the season eight finale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/06/01/greys-anatomy-chyler-leigh-explains-exit/|title=Grey's Anatomy Exclusive: Chyler Leigh Breaks Her Silence About Shocking Departure|last=Mitovich|first=Michael Web|work=TV Guide|date=June 1, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref> while [[Kim Raver]] also departed from the show following the events of the season eight finale, having declined the offer of a contract extension.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|title='Grey's Anatomy' season finale: Boss  exits|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/18/greys-anatomy-season-finale-boss-explains-two-shocking-exits/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/09/05/revolution-casts-kim-raver/|title=Exclusive: Grey's Anatomy Alum Kim Raver Joins in NBC's Revolution|last=Mitovich|first=Michael Web|work=TV Guide|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref>  Other series regulars, [[Sara Ramirez]], [[Kevin McKidd]], [[Jessica Capshaw]], [[Sarah Drew]], and [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] all returned to the series as regulars, though Capshaw would not have a major role in the first few episodes because of her maternity leave.\n\n[[File:Eric Dane - White House Correspondents' Association Dinner - cropped.jpg|thumb|190px| [[Eric Dane]] made his final appearance as [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] in the second episode as he succumbed to his injuries from the crash.]]\n\nIn August 2012, it was announced that [[Camilla Luddington]], [[Gaius Charles]], and [[Tina Majorino]] had been cast as Jo Wilson, Shane Ross, and Heather Brooks, respectively;

It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace-Mercy West Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. A major theme of the season is the characters adapting to change, as all of the fifth-year surgical residents have turned into surgical attendings, and are now teaching interns, and operating on their own surgeries. The early episodes of the season depict the characters dealing with the aftermath of the season eight plane crash that claimed the life of [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) and upon rescue [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), who dies in the first episode. \n\n[[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) finds his surgical career in doubt after badly damaging his hand but ultimately his sister Liz ([[Neve Campbell]]) donates a nerve from her leg and [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) is able to save his hand. Later, Shepherd receives more good news when his wife [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]) discovers that she is pregnant, despite her previously being told that it was unlikely that she could conceive. [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) is severely traumatized upon rescue and suffers from [[brief reactive psychosis]] and eventually decides to take up her fellowship in Minnesota, though soon grows unhappy in her new surroundings and returns to Seattle after the death of her friend and mentor, Doctor Thomas. [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) survives the plane crash in spite of her leg injury, but upon return her wound becomes infected and her leg has to be amputated to save her life. Robbins reacts badly to this, becoming bitter and blaming her wife Callie and her former friend [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) and refuses to leave her bed or return to work.\n\nDerek discovers that prior to the plane crash, the hospital had recently changed airlines to one with a poorer safety record for budgetary reasons, resulting in the four crash survivors (Grey, Shepherd, Robbins and Yang) deciding to pursue a lawsuit, and it soon becomes apparent that chief of surgery [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]) had given the go-ahead to the change. To prevent the doctors' court case from being thrown out, Hunt decides to divorce Yang, but the two secretly resume their relationship and agree to start again. Despite contemplating a settlement, the doctors decide to continue with the lawsuit and eventually are awarded fifteen million dollars each, but the insurance company discovers an unexpected loophole and refuse to pay, resulting in the hospital itself becoming liable, putting its future in extreme doubt. Dr. Alana Cahill ([[Constance Zimmer]]) is appointed to cut costs at the hospital and she eventually decides the best course of action would be to seek out a new buyer and attracts the interest of a company named Pegasus. Later however, Torres and [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]) discover the unpleasant consequences that would fall upon the hospital should they be taken over by Pegasus prompting the four crash survivors (and Torres on the behalf of Sloan) to pool their money together in a bid to purchase the hospital themselves and quit their jobs, resulting in Pegasus pulling out. The doctors run into trouble when they fail to secure an extra benefactor, but at the last minute Catherine Avery ([[Debbie Allen]]) reveals that the Harper Avery Foundation is willing to provide a majority share in the company, on the condition that they have at least one member on the board of directors. The doctors agree and their purchase is complete, only for Catherine to appoint her son [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]) to part of the board, effectively putting him in charge of the entire hospital.\n\nIn other storylines, [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) marries her partner Ben Warren ([[Jason George]]), despite suffering from last-minute nerves and missing the original wedding ceremony due to Adele Webber ([[Loretta Devine]]) being admitted to the hospital. Adele later dies after her surgery, leaving her husband Richard wracked with guilt due to his relationship with Catherine Avery. A new group of interns arrives at Seattle Grace and soon Karev strikes up a close friendship with Jo Wilson ([[Camilla Luddington]]) but the pair fall short of developing a romance, despite other characters commenting on their chemistry. After failing her board exams in season eight, [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) returns home to Ohio, but is later brought back by Hunt and resumes her job at the hospital.

Today the town offers nearly 10.000 beds,  also because of health reasons,  the town counts as a well known and highly recommended holiday resort.\n\nThe art historian [[Wilhelm Titel]] was born in Boltenhagen.  \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline}}\n* {{Official website}} {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Nordwestmecklenburg (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in Germany]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Germany (Baltic Sea)]]\n[[Category:Nordwestmecklenburg]]\n[[Category:Bezirk Rostock]]\n\n{{Nordwestmecklenburg-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltenhagen"}

However, contrarily to the common opinion, most primates do not have especially large brains. Brain size is a derived character, which only appeared with genus ''[[Homo]]'', and was lacking in the first [[Hominidae|hominid]]. In fact, hominid encephalization quotient is only 1.5 [[megaannum|Ma]] more recent than that of some dolphin species. The encephalization quotient of some [[cetacean]]s is therefore higher than that of most primates, including the nearest relatives of humans, such as ''[[Australopithecus]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conway Morris, S. |title=Life's Solution.

However, contrarily to the common opinion, most primates do not have especially large brains. Brain size is a derived character, which only appeared with genus ''[[Homo]]'', and was lacking in the first [[Hominidae|hominid]]. In fact, hominid encephalization quotient is only 1.5 [[megaannum|Ma]] more recent than that of some dolphin species. The encephalization quotient of some [[cetacean]]s is therefore higher than that of most primates, including the nearest relatives of humans, such as ''[[Australopithecus]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Conway Morris, S. |title=Life's Solution.

After an exploration of the upper [[Niger River]] around 1796, he wrote a popular and influential [[travel literature|travel book]] titled ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'' in which he theorized the Niger and Congo merged to become the same river. He was killed during a second expedition, having successfully traveled about two-thirds of the way down the Niger. Park's death meant the idea of a Niger-Congo merger remained unproven but it became the leading theory among geographers.{{sfn|Maclachlan|1898|p=[https://archive.org/details/mungopark00maclrich/page/130 130]. \"..became the general opinion\"}} The mystery of the Niger's course, which had been speculated about since the Ancient Greeks and was second only to the [[Nile#Search_for_the_source_of_the_Nile|mystery of the Nile source]], was not solved for another 25 years, in 1830, when it was discovered the Niger and Congo were in fact separate rivers. \n\nIf the [[African Association]] was the \"beginning of the [[European exploration of Africa|age of African exploration]]\" then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer; he set a standard for all who followed. Park was the first [[Western culture|Westerner]] to have recorded travels in the central portion of the Niger, and through his popular book introduced the public to a vast unexplored continent which influenced future European explorers and colonial ambitions in Africa.\n\n==Early life==\nMungo Park was born in [[Selkirkshire]], Scotland, at Foulshiels on the [[Yarrow Water]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], on a tenant farm which his father rented from the [[Duke of Buccleuch]]. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen.{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR3 iii Vol. 2]}}{{sfn|Thomson|1890|pp=37-38}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} Although tenant farmers, the Parks were relatively well-off. They were able to pay for Park to receive a good education, and Park's father died leaving property valued at \u00a33,000 ({{Inflation|UK|3000|1800|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-3}}).{{inflation-fn|UK}} His parents had originally intended him for the Church of Scotland.{{sfn|H.B.|1835|p=14}}\n\nHe was educated at home before attending Selkirk grammar school. At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to Thomas Anderson, a surgeon in Selkirk. During his apprenticeship, Park became friends with Anderson's son Alexander and was introduced to Anderson's daughter Allison, who would later become his wife.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=221}}\n\nIn October 1788, Park enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]], attending for four sessions studying medicine and botany. Notably, during his time at university, he spent a year in the natural history course taught by [[John Walker (naturalist)|Professor John Walker]]. After completing his studies, he spent a summer in the Scottish Highlands, engaged in botanical fieldwork with his brother-in-law, [[James Dickson (biologist)|James Dickson]], a gardener and seed merchant in [[Covent Garden]]. In 1788 Dickson along with Sir [[James Edward Smith]] and six other fellows founded the [[Linnean Society]] of [[London]].\n\nIn 1792 Park completed his medical studies at [[University of Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Lupton|1979|p=10}} Through a recommendation by [[Joseph Banks]] he obtained the post of assistant surgeon on board the East India Company's ship {{ship||Worcester|1785 EIC ship|2}}. In February 1793 the ''Worcester'' sailed to [[Bengkulu|Benkulen]] in [[Sumatra]]. Before departing, Park wrote to his friend Alexander Anderson in terms that reflect his Calvinist upbringing:\n\n{{quote|\nMy hope is now approaching to a certainty. If I be deceived, may God alone put me right, for I would rather die in the delusion than wake to all the joys of earth. May the Holy Spirit dwell in your heart, my dear friend, and if I ever see my native land again, may I rather see the green sod on your grave than see you anything but a Christian.\n|source={{harvnb|Lupton|1979|p=14}} }}\n\nOn his return in 1794, Park gave a lecture to the [[Linnaean Society]], describing eight new Sumatran fish. The paper was not published until three years later.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|pp=17, 38}}{{sfn|Park|1797}} He also presented Banks with various rare Sumatran plants.\n\n==Travels into the Interior of Africa==\n===First journey===\n[[File:Kamalia Mungo Park 1790s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of Kamalia in [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] country, Africa, from: Mungo Park, ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'']]\n[[File:Mungo Park cover1859.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Park was one of the first European explorers of Central Africa, and was one of the first explorers mentioned in ''Reisen in Central-Afrika \u2013 von Mungo Park bis auf [[Heinrich Barth|Dr. Barth]] u. [[Eduard Vogel|Dr. Vogel]]'' (1859) (''Travels in Central-Africa \u2013 from Mungo Park to Dr. Barth and Dr. Vogel)'']]\n\nOn 26 September 1794 Mungo Park offered his services to the [[African Association]], then looking for a successor to Major [[Daniel Houghton]], who had been sent in 1790 to discover the course of the [[Niger River]] and had died in the [[Sahara]]. Supported by Sir [[Joseph Banks]], Park was selected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nOn 22 May 1795, Park left Portsmouth, England, on the brig ''Endeavour'', a vessel travelling to Gambia to trade for beeswax and ivory.{{sfn|H.B.|1835|p=34}}\n\nOn 21 June 1795, he reached the [[Gambia River]] and ascended it {{convert|200|mi|km|sigfig=1}} to a British trading station named [[Pisania (trading post)|Pisania]]. On 2 December, accompanied by two local guides, he started for the unknown interior.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29 29]}} He chose the route crossing the upper [[Senegal]] basin and through the semi-desert region of [[Kaarta]]. The journey was full of difficulties, and at [[Ludamar]] he was imprisoned by a [[Moorish]] chief for four months. On 1 July 1796, he escaped, alone and with nothing but his horse and a pocket compass, and on the 21st reached the long-sought [[Niger River]] at [[S\u00e9gou]], being the first European to do so.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA194 194]}} He followed the river downstream {{convert|80|mi|km|sigfig=2}} to Silla, where he was obliged to turn back,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} lacking the resources to go further.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211 211]}}\n                         \nOn his return journey, begun on 29 July, he took a route more to the south than that originally followed, keeping close to the Niger River as far as [[Bamako]], thus tracing its course for some {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1}}.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA238 238]}} At Kamalia he fell ill, and owed his life to the kindness of a man in whose house he lived for seven months. Eventually he reached Pisania again on 10 June 1797, returning to [[Scotland]] by way of [[Antigua]] on 22 December. He had been thought dead, and his return home with news of his exploration of the Niger River evoked great public enthusiasm. An account of his journey was drawn up for the African Association by Bryan Edwards, and his own detailed narrative appeared in 1799 (''Travels in the Interior of Africa'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nPark was convinced that: \n{{quote|\nwhatever difference there is between the negro and European, in the conformation of the nose, and the colour of the skin, there is none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic feelings of our common nature.\n|source={{harvnb|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA82 82]}} }}\n\nPark encountered a group of [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] when traveling through [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] country Mali: \n{{quote|\nThey were all very inquisitive, but they viewed me at first with looks of horror, and repeatedly asked if my countrymen were cannibals. They were very desirous to know what became of the slaves after they had crossed the salt water. I told them that they were employed in cultivating the land; but they would not believe me; and one of them putting his hand upon the ground, said with great simplicity, \"have you really got such ground as this, to set your feet upon?\" A deeply-rooted idea that the whites purchase Negroes for the purpose of devouring them, or of selling them to others that they may be devoured hereafter, naturally makes the slaves contemplate a journey towards the Coast with great terror, insomuch that the Slatees{{efn|the black slave-merchants}} are forced to keep them constantly in irons, and watch them very closely, to prevent their escape.\n|source={{harvnb|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA319 319]}} }}\n\nHis book ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'' became a best-seller{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=221}} because it detailed what he observed, what he survived, and the people he encountered.{{sfn|Fyfe|2004}} His dispassionate \u2014 if not scientific or objective \u2014 descriptions set a standard for future travel writers to follow and gave Europeans a glimpse of Africa's humanity and complexity. Park introduced them to a vast continent unexplored by Europeans. If the [[African Association]] was the  \"beginning of the age of [[European exploration of Africa|African exploration]]\"{{sfn|Kryza|2006|p=11}} then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer, he set a standard for all who followed. After his death, European public and political interest in Africa began to increase. Perhaps the most lasting effect of Park's travels, though, was the influence on European colonial ambitions during the 19th century.\n\n===Between journeys===\nSettling at Foulshiels, in August 1799 Park married Allison, daughter of his apprenticeship master, Thomas Anderson.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|p=121}} A project to go to [[New South Wales]] in some official capacity came to nothing, and in October 1801 Park moved to [[Peebles]], where he practised as a physician.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Second journey===\nIn the autumn of 1803 Mungo Park was invited by the government to lead another expedition to the Niger. Park, who chafed at the hardness and monotony of life at Peebles, accepted the offer, but the expedition was delayed. Part of the waiting time was occupied perfecting his [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; his teacher, Sidi Ambak Bubi, was a native of [[Mogador]] (now [[Essaouira]] in Morocco) whose behavior both amused and alarmed the people of Peebles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n[[Image:Mungo Parks Route 1795-97 and 1805-06.png|left|thumb|350px|Map of Mungo Park's journeys]]\n\nIn May 1804 Park went back to Foulshiels, where he made the acquaintance of [[Sir Walter Scott|Walter Scott]], then living nearby at Ashiesteil and with whom he soon became friendly. In September, Park was summoned to London to leave on the new expedition; he left Scott with the hopeful proverb on his lips,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} \"Freits (omens) follow those that look to them.\"{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR160 clx Vol. 2]}}\n\nPark had at that time adopted the theory that the Niger and the Congo were one, and in a memorandum drawn up before he left Britain he wrote: \"My hopes of returning by the Congo are not altogether fanciful.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nOn 31 January 1805 he sailed from [[Portsmouth]] for [[Gambia]], having been given a captain's commission as head of the government expedition. Alexander Anderson, his brother-in-law and second-in-command, had received a lieutenancy. George Scott, a fellow [[Scottish Borders|Borderer]], was draughtsman, and the party included four or five artificers. At [[Gor\u00e9e]] (then in British occupation) Park was joined by Lieutenant Martyn, R.A., thirty-five privates and two seamen.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThe expedition got a late start into the rainy season and did not reach the Niger until mid-August, when only eleven Europeans were left alive; the rest had succumbed to fever or [[dysentery]].{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} From [[Bamako]] the journey to [[S\u00e9gou]] was made by canoe. Having received permission from the local ruler, [[Mansong Diarra]], to proceed, at [[Sansanding]], a little below S\u00e9gou, Park made ready for his journey down the still unknown part of the river. Helped by one soldier, the only one capable of work, Park converted two canoes into one tolerably good boat, {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} long and {{convert|6|ft|m|0}} broad. This he christened H.M. schooner ''Joliba'' (the native name for the Niger River), and in it, with the surviving members of his party, he set sail downstream on 19 November.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nAnderson had died at Sansanding on 28 October, and in him Park had lost the only member of the party \u2013 except Scott, already dead \u2013 \"who had been of real use.\"{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA222 222 Vol. 2]}} Those who embarked in the ''Joliba'' were Park, Martyn, three European soldiers (one mad), a guide and three slaves. Before his departure, Park gave to Isaaco, a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] guide who had been with him thus far, letters to take back to [[Gambia]] for transmission to Britain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThe Moors along this section of the Niger did not believe Park was exploring purely for intellectual curiosity but was scouting European trading routes, they saw Park as a threat to Moorish trading dominance.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} They lobbied Mansong Diarra to have Park killed, and when Mansong did not, they lobbied tribes further down the river. Park understood the politics and adopted a policy of staying away from the shore towards the middle of the 2 to 3 mile-wide river while attacking anyone who came near.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} In the process he also avoided paying tolls/bribes to pass through each kingdom, earning the rage of local rulers, Moorish or not, who would send messengers ahead to the next tribe downriver that a dangerous interloper was coming their way. Furthermore Park's policy of shoot first and not engaging with locals, in some cases slaughtering significant numbers of natives using superior firepower, made the Europeans something of a pariah. Park was running a gauntlet of hostile tribes in part of his own making.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}}\n\nTo his wife, Park wrote of his intention not to stop nor land anywhere until he reached the coast, where he expected to arrive about the end of January 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThese were the last communications received from Park, and nothing more was heard of the party until reports of disaster reached Gambia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Mungo Park Monument, Selkirk, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The Mungo Park Monument in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], Scotland by [[Andrew Currie (sculptor)|Andrew Currie]]]]\nAt length, the British government engaged Isaaco to go to the Niger to ascertain Park's fate. At Sansanding, Isaaco found Amadi Fatouma (Isaaco calls him Amaudy),{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909954 381]}} the guide who had gone downstream with Park, and the substantial accuracy of the story he told was later confirmed by the investigations of [[Hugh Clapperton]] and [[Richard Lemon Lander|Richard Lander]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nAmadi Fatouma stated that Park's canoe had descended the river as far as Sibby without incident. After Sibby three canoes chased them and Park's party repulsed them with firearms.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909955 382]}} A similar incident occurred at Cabbara and again at Toomboucouton. At Gouroumo seven canoes pursued them. One of the party died of sickness leaving \"four white men, myself [Amadi], and three slaves\". Each person (including the slaves) had \"15 musquets apiece, well loaded and always ready for action\".{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909955 382]}} After passing the residence of the king of Goloijigi, 60 canoes came after them which they \"repulsed after killing many natives\". Further along they encountered an army of the Poule nation and kept to the opposite bank to avoid an action. After a close encounter with a hippopotamus they continued past Caffo (3 canoes) to an island where Isaaco was taken prisoner. Park rescued him, and 20 canoes chased them. This time they merely asked Amadi for trinkets which Park supplied.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909956 383]}} At Gourmon they traded for provisions and were warned of an ambush up ahead. They passed the army \"being all Moors\" and entered [[Hausaland|Haoussa]], finally arriving at [[Yauri, Nigeria|Yauri]] (which Amadi calls Yaour),{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909956 383]}} where he (Fatouma) landed. In this long journey of some {{convert|1,000|mi|km|sigfig=2}} Park, who had plenty of provisions, stuck to his resolution of keeping away from the natives. Below [[Djenn\u00e9]], came [[Timbuktu]], and at various other places the natives came out in canoes and attacked his boat. These attacks were all repulsed, Park and his party having plenty of firearms and ammunition and the natives having none. The boat also escaped the many perils attendant on navigating an unknown stream strewn with many rapids;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} Park had built ''Joliba'' so that she drew only {{convert|1|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} of water.\n\nAt Haoussa, Amadi traded with the local chief. Amadi reports that Park gave him five silver rings, some powder and flints to give as a gift to the chief of the village. The following day Amadi visited the king where Amadi was accused of not having given the chief a present. Amadi was \"put in irons\". The king then sent an army to Boussa where there is a natural narrowing of the river commanded by high rock.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909957 384]}} But at the [[Bussa, Nigeria|Bussa rapids]], not far below [[Yauri, Nigeria|Yauri]], the boat became stuck on a rock and remained fast. On the bank were gathered hostile natives, who attacked the party with bow and arrow and throwing spears. Their position being untenable, Park, Martyn and the two remaining soldiers sprang into the river and were drowned. The sole survivor was one of the slaves. After three months in irons, Amadi was released and talked with the surviving slave, from whom was obtained the story of the final scene.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909957 384]}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nAmadi paid a [[Peulh]] man to obtain Park's sword belt. Amadi then returned first to Sansanding and then to [[Segou]]. After, Amadi went to Dacha and told the king what had passed. The king sent an army past \"Tombouctou\" ([[Timbuktu]]) to Sacha but decided that [[Hausaland|Haoussa]] was too far for a punitive expedition. Instead they went to [[Inland Niger Delta|Massina]], a small \"Paul\" [[Peulh]] country where they took all the cattle and returned home. Amadi appears to have been part of this expedition: \"We came altogether back to Sego\" ([[Segou]]). Amadi then returned to Sansanding via Sego. Eventually the Peulh man obtained the sword belt and after a voyage of eight months met up with Amadi and gave him the belt. Isaaco met Amadi in Sego and having obtained the sword belt returned to Senegal.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909958 385]}}\n\nIsaaco, and later [[Richard Lander]], obtained some of Park's effects, but his journal was never recovered. In 1827 his second son, Thomas, landed on the [[Guinea]] coast, intending to make his way to [[Bussa (town)|Bussa]], where he thought his father might be detained a prisoner; but after penetrating a little distance inland he died of fever.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=826\u2013827}} Park's widow, Allison, received a previously agreed upon \u00a34,000 settlement from the [[African Association]] as a result of the death of Mungo Park. She died in 1840. Mungo Park's remains are believed to have been buried along the banks of the River Niger in Jebba, Nigeria.\n\nWith Park's death the mystery of the Niger remained unsolved. Park's theory that the Niger and Congo were the same river became the general opinion in the years after his death. However even while Park was alive, an amateur German geographer named Reichard proposed the Niger delta was the mouth of the river, but his theory was one of many and did not have much currency because the delta had so many small streams it did not appear to be from a great river. In 1821, [[James McQueen (pioneer)|James McQueen]] published a book, the result of 25 years of research, in which he correctly (it would later be seen) laid out the entire course of the Niger, however like Reichard, his theories did not receive much notice. A number of failed expeditions were mounted but the mystery would finally be solved 25 years after Park's death, in 1830. [[Richard Lander]] and his brother became the first Europeans to follow the course of the Niger from source to ocean.{{sfn|Maclachlan|1898|p=[https://archive.org/details/mungopark00maclrich/page/130 130-142]}}\n\n==Medal==\nThe [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] award the [[Mungo Park Medal]] annually in Park's honour.<ref name=\"RSGS\" />\n\n==In media==\nMungo Park appears as one of the two protagonists in the novel ''[[Water Music (novel)|Water Music]]'' by [[T.

After an exploration of the upper [[Niger River]] around 1796, he wrote a popular and influential [[travel literature|travel book]] titled ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'' in which he theorized the Niger and Congo merged to become the same river. He was killed during a second expedition, having successfully traveled about two-thirds of the way down the Niger. Park's death meant the idea of a Niger-Congo merger remained unproven but it became the leading theory among geographers.{{sfn|Maclachlan|1898|p=[https://archive.org/details/mungopark00maclrich/page/130 130]. \"..became the general opinion\"}} The mystery of the Niger's course, which had been speculated about since the Ancient Greeks and was second only to the [[Nile#Search_for_the_source_of_the_Nile|mystery of the Nile source]], was not solved for another 25 years, in 1830, when it was discovered the Niger and Congo were in fact separate rivers. \n\nIf the [[African Association]] was the \"beginning of the [[European exploration of Africa|age of African exploration]]\" then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer; he set a standard for all who followed. Park was the first [[Western culture|Westerner]] to have recorded travels in the central portion of the Niger, and through his popular book introduced the public to a vast unexplored continent which influenced future European explorers and colonial ambitions in Africa.\n\n==Early life==\nMungo Park was born in [[Selkirkshire]], Scotland, at Foulshiels on the [[Yarrow Water]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], on a tenant farm which his father rented from the [[Duke of Buccleuch]]. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen.{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR3 iii Vol. 2]}}{{sfn|Thomson|1890|pp=37-38}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} Although tenant farmers, the Parks were relatively well-off. They were able to pay for Park to receive a good education, and Park's father died leaving property valued at \u00a33,000 ({{Inflation|UK|3000|1800|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-3}}).{{inflation-fn|UK}} His parents had originally intended him for the Church of Scotland.{{sfn|H.B.|1835|p=14}}\n\nHe was educated at home before attending Selkirk grammar school. At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to Thomas Anderson, a surgeon in Selkirk. During his apprenticeship, Park became friends with Anderson's son Alexander and was introduced to Anderson's daughter Allison, who would later become his wife.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=221}}\n\nIn October 1788, Park enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]], attending for four sessions studying medicine and botany. Notably, during his time at university, he spent a year in the natural history course taught by [[John Walker (naturalist)|Professor John Walker]]. After completing his studies, he spent a summer in the Scottish Highlands, engaged in botanical fieldwork with his brother-in-law, [[James Dickson (biologist)|James Dickson]], a gardener and seed merchant in [[Covent Garden]]. In 1788 Dickson along with Sir [[James Edward Smith]] and six other fellows founded the [[Linnean Society]] of [[London]].\n\nIn 1792 Park completed his medical studies at [[University of Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Lupton|1979|p=10}} Through a recommendation by [[Joseph Banks]] he obtained the post of assistant surgeon on board the East India Company's ship {{ship||Worcester|1785 EIC ship|2}}. In February 1793 the ''Worcester'' sailed to [[Bengkulu|Benkulen]] in [[Sumatra]]. Before departing, Park wrote to his friend Alexander Anderson in terms that reflect his Calvinist upbringing:\n\n{{quote|\nMy hope is now approaching to a certainty. If I be deceived, may God alone put me right, for I would rather die in the delusion than wake to all the joys of earth. May the Holy Spirit dwell in your heart, my dear friend, and if I ever see my native land again, may I rather see the green sod on your grave than see you anything but a Christian.\n|source={{harvnb|Lupton|1979|p=14}} }}\n\nOn his return in 1794, Park gave a lecture to the [[Linnaean Society]], describing eight new Sumatran fish. The paper was not published until three years later.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|pp=17, 38}}{{sfn|Park|1797}} He also presented Banks with various rare Sumatran plants.\n\n==Travels into the Interior of Africa==\n===First journey===\n[[File:Kamalia Mungo Park 1790s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of Kamalia in [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] country, Africa, from: Mungo Park, ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'']]\n[[File:Mungo Park cover1859.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Park was one of the first European explorers of Central Africa, and was one of the first explorers mentioned in ''Reisen in Central-Afrika \u2013 von Mungo Park bis auf [[Heinrich Barth|Dr. Barth]] u. [[Eduard Vogel|Dr. Vogel]]'' (1859) (''Travels in Central-Africa \u2013 from Mungo Park to Dr. Barth and Dr. Vogel)'']]\n\nOn 26 September 1794 Mungo Park offered his services to the [[African Association]], then looking for a successor to Major [[Daniel Houghton]], who had been sent in 1790 to discover the course of the [[Niger River]] and had died in the [[Sahara]]. Supported by Sir [[Joseph Banks]], Park was selected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nOn 22 May 1795, Park left Portsmouth, England, on the brig ''Endeavour'', a vessel travelling to Gambia to trade for beeswax and ivory.{{sfn|H.B.|1835|p=34}}\n\nOn 21 June 1795, he reached the [[Gambia River]] and ascended it {{convert|200|mi|km|sigfig=1}} to a British trading station named [[Pisania (trading post)|Pisania]]. On 2 December, accompanied by two local guides, he started for the unknown interior.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29 29]}} He chose the route crossing the upper [[Senegal]] basin and through the semi-desert region of [[Kaarta]]. The journey was full of difficulties, and at [[Ludamar]] he was imprisoned by a [[Moorish]] chief for four months. On 1 July 1796, he escaped, alone and with nothing but his horse and a pocket compass, and on the 21st reached the long-sought [[Niger River]] at [[S\u00e9gou]], being the first European to do so.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA194 194]}} He followed the river downstream {{convert|80|mi|km|sigfig=2}} to Silla, where he was obliged to turn back,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} lacking the resources to go further.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211 211]}}\n                         \nOn his return journey, begun on 29 July, he took a route more to the south than that originally followed, keeping close to the Niger River as far as [[Bamako]], thus tracing its course for some {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1}}.{{sfn|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA238 238]}} At Kamalia he fell ill, and owed his life to the kindness of a man in whose house he lived for seven months. Eventually he reached Pisania again on 10 June 1797, returning to [[Scotland]] by way of [[Antigua]] on 22 December. He had been thought dead, and his return home with news of his exploration of the Niger River evoked great public enthusiasm. An account of his journey was drawn up for the African Association by Bryan Edwards, and his own detailed narrative appeared in 1799 (''Travels in the Interior of Africa'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nPark was convinced that: \n{{quote|\nwhatever difference there is between the negro and European, in the conformation of the nose, and the colour of the skin, there is none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic feelings of our common nature.\n|source={{harvnb|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA82 82]}} }}\n\nPark encountered a group of [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] when traveling through [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] country Mali: \n{{quote|\nThey were all very inquisitive, but they viewed me at first with looks of horror, and repeatedly asked if my countrymen were cannibals. They were very desirous to know what became of the slaves after they had crossed the salt water. I told them that they were employed in cultivating the land; but they would not believe me; and one of them putting his hand upon the ground, said with great simplicity, \"have you really got such ground as this, to set your feet upon?\" A deeply-rooted idea that the whites purchase Negroes for the purpose of devouring them, or of selling them to others that they may be devoured hereafter, naturally makes the slaves contemplate a journey towards the Coast with great terror, insomuch that the Slatees{{efn|the black slave-merchants}} are forced to keep them constantly in irons, and watch them very closely, to prevent their escape.\n|source={{harvnb|Park|1799|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA319 319]}} }}\n\nHis book ''Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa'' became a best-seller{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=221}} because it detailed what he observed, what he survived, and the people he encountered.{{sfn|Fyfe|2004}} His dispassionate \u2014 if not scientific or objective \u2014 descriptions set a standard for future travel writers to follow and gave Europeans a glimpse of Africa's humanity and complexity. Park introduced them to a vast continent unexplored by Europeans. If the [[African Association]] was the  \"beginning of the age of [[European exploration of Africa|African exploration]]\"{{sfn|Kryza|2006|p=11}} then Mungo Park was its first successful explorer, he set a standard for all who followed. After his death, European public and political interest in Africa began to increase. Perhaps the most lasting effect of Park's travels, though, was the influence on European colonial ambitions during the 19th century.\n\n===Between journeys===\nSettling at Foulshiels, in August 1799 Park married Allison, daughter of his apprenticeship master, Thomas Anderson.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|p=121}} A project to go to [[New South Wales]] in some official capacity came to nothing, and in October 1801 Park moved to [[Peebles]], where he practised as a physician.{{sfn|Lupton|1979|pp=125-126}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Second journey===\nIn the autumn of 1803 Mungo Park was invited by the government to lead another expedition to the Niger. Park, who chafed at the hardness and monotony of life at Peebles, accepted the offer, but the expedition was delayed. Part of the waiting time was occupied perfecting his [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; his teacher, Sidi Ambak Bubi, was a native of [[Mogador]] (now [[Essaouira]] in Morocco) whose behavior both amused and alarmed the people of Peebles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n[[Image:Mungo Parks Route 1795-97 and 1805-06.png|left|thumb|350px|Map of Mungo Park's journeys]]\n\nIn May 1804 Park went back to Foulshiels, where he made the acquaintance of [[Sir Walter Scott|Walter Scott]], then living nearby at Ashiesteil and with whom he soon became friendly. In September, Park was summoned to London to leave on the new expedition; he left Scott with the hopeful proverb on his lips,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} \"Freits (omens) follow those that look to them.\"{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR160 clx Vol. 2]}}\n\nPark had at that time adopted the theory that the Niger and the Congo were one, and in a memorandum drawn up before he left Britain he wrote: \"My hopes of returning by the Congo are not altogether fanciful.\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nOn 31 January 1805 he sailed from [[Portsmouth]] for [[Gambia]], having been given a captain's commission as head of the government expedition. Alexander Anderson, his brother-in-law and second-in-command, had received a lieutenancy. George Scott, a fellow [[Scottish Borders|Borderer]], was draughtsman, and the party included four or five artificers. At [[Gor\u00e9e]] (then in British occupation) Park was joined by Lieutenant Martyn, R.A., thirty-five privates and two seamen.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThe expedition got a late start into the rainy season and did not reach the Niger until mid-August, when only eleven Europeans were left alive; the rest had succumbed to fever or [[dysentery]].{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} From [[Bamako]] the journey to [[S\u00e9gou]] was made by canoe. Having received permission from the local ruler, [[Mansong Diarra]], to proceed, at [[Sansanding]], a little below S\u00e9gou, Park made ready for his journey down the still unknown part of the river. Helped by one soldier, the only one capable of work, Park converted two canoes into one tolerably good boat, {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} long and {{convert|6|ft|m|0}} broad. This he christened H.M. schooner ''Joliba'' (the native name for the Niger River), and in it, with the surviving members of his party, he set sail downstream on 19 November.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nAnderson had died at Sansanding on 28 October, and in him Park had lost the only member of the party \u2013 except Scott, already dead \u2013 \"who had been of real use.\"{{sfn|Park|1816b|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=89INAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA222 222 Vol. 2]}} Those who embarked in the ''Joliba'' were Park, Martyn, three European soldiers (one mad), a guide and three slaves. Before his departure, Park gave to Isaaco, a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] guide who had been with him thus far, letters to take back to [[Gambia]] for transmission to Britain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThe Moors along this section of the Niger did not believe Park was exploring purely for intellectual curiosity but was scouting European trading routes, they saw Park as a threat to Moorish trading dominance.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} They lobbied Mansong Diarra to have Park killed, and when Mansong did not, they lobbied tribes further down the river. Park understood the politics and adopted a policy of staying away from the shore towards the middle of the 2 to 3 mile-wide river while attacking anyone who came near.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}} In the process he also avoided paying tolls/bribes to pass through each kingdom, earning the rage of local rulers, Moorish or not, who would send messengers ahead to the next tribe downriver that a dangerous interloper was coming their way. Furthermore Park's policy of shoot first and not engaging with locals, in some cases slaughtering significant numbers of natives using superior firepower, made the Europeans something of a pariah. Park was running a gauntlet of hostile tribes in part of his own making.{{sfn|Bovill|1968|pp=1-30 \"The Death of Mungo Park\"}}\n\nTo his wife, Park wrote of his intention not to stop nor land anywhere until he reached the coast, where he expected to arrive about the end of January 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nThese were the last communications received from Park, and nothing more was heard of the party until reports of disaster reached Gambia.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Mungo Park Monument, Selkirk, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The Mungo Park Monument in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], Scotland by [[Andrew Currie (sculptor)|Andrew Currie]]]]\nAt length, the British government engaged Isaaco to go to the Niger to ascertain Park's fate. At Sansanding, Isaaco found Amadi Fatouma (Isaaco calls him Amaudy),{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909954 381]}} the guide who had gone downstream with Park, and the substantial accuracy of the story he told was later confirmed by the investigations of [[Hugh Clapperton]] and [[Richard Lemon Lander|Richard Lander]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\nAmadi Fatouma stated that Park's canoe had descended the river as far as Sibby without incident. After Sibby three canoes chased them and Park's party repulsed them with firearms.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909955 382]}} A similar incident occurred at Cabbara and again at Toomboucouton. At Gouroumo seven canoes pursued them. One of the party died of sickness leaving \"four white men, myself [Amadi], and three slaves\". Each person (including the slaves) had \"15 musquets apiece, well loaded and always ready for action\".{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909955 382]}} After passing the residence of the king of Goloijigi, 60 canoes came after them which they \"repulsed after killing many natives\". Further along they encountered an army of the Poule nation and kept to the opposite bank to avoid an action. After a close encounter with a hippopotamus they continued past Caffo (3 canoes) to an island where Isaaco was taken prisoner. Park rescued him, and 20 canoes chased them. This time they merely asked Amadi for trinkets which Park supplied.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909956 383]}} At Gourmon they traded for provisions and were warned of an ambush up ahead. They passed the army \"being all Moors\" and entered [[Hausaland|Haoussa]], finally arriving at [[Yauri, Nigeria|Yauri]] (which Amadi calls Yaour),{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909956 383]}} where he (Fatouma) landed. In this long journey of some {{convert|1,000|mi|km|sigfig=2}} Park, who had plenty of provisions, stuck to his resolution of keeping away from the natives. Below [[Djenn\u00e9]], came [[Timbuktu]], and at various other places the natives came out in canoes and attacked his boat. These attacks were all repulsed, Park and his party having plenty of firearms and ammunition and the natives having none. The boat also escaped the many perils attendant on navigating an unknown stream strewn with many rapids;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}} Park had built ''Joliba'' so that she drew only {{convert|1|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} of water.\n\nAt Haoussa, Amadi traded with the local chief. Amadi reports that Park gave him five silver rings, some powder and flints to give as a gift to the chief of the village. The following day Amadi visited the king where Amadi was accused of not having given the chief a present. Amadi was \"put in irons\". The king then sent an army to Boussa where there is a natural narrowing of the river commanded by high rock.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909957 384]}} But at the [[Bussa, Nigeria|Bussa rapids]], not far below [[Yauri, Nigeria|Yauri]], the boat became stuck on a rock and remained fast. On the bank were gathered hostile natives, who attacked the party with bow and arrow and throwing spears. Their position being untenable, Park, Martyn and the two remaining soldiers sprang into the river and were drowned. The sole survivor was one of the slaves. After three months in irons, Amadi was released and talked with the surviving slave, from whom was obtained the story of the final scene.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909957 384]}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=826}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nAmadi paid a [[Peulh]] man to obtain Park's sword belt. Amadi then returned first to Sansanding and then to [[Segou]]. After, Amadi went to Dacha and told the king what had passed. The king sent an army past \"Tombouctou\" ([[Timbuktu]]) to Sacha but decided that [[Hausaland|Haoussa]] was too far for a punitive expedition. Instead they went to [[Inland Niger Delta|Massina]], a small \"Paul\" [[Peulh]] country where they took all the cattle and returned home. Amadi appears to have been part of this expedition: \"We came altogether back to Sego\" ([[Segou]]). Amadi then returned to Sansanding via Sego. Eventually the Peulh man obtained the sword belt and after a voyage of eight months met up with Amadi and gave him the belt. Isaaco met Amadi in Sego and having obtained the sword belt returned to Senegal.{{sfn|Isaaco|1814|p=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15909958 385]}}\n\nIsaaco, and later [[Richard Lander]], obtained some of Park's effects, but his journal was never recovered. In 1827 his second son, Thomas, landed on the [[Guinea]] coast, intending to make his way to [[Bussa (town)|Bussa]], where he thought his father might be detained a prisoner; but after penetrating a little distance inland he died of fever.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=826\u2013827}} Park's widow, Allison, received a previously agreed upon \u00a34,000 settlement from the [[African Association]] as a result of the death of Mungo Park. She died in 1840. Mungo Park's remains are believed to have been buried along the banks of the River Niger in Jebba, Nigeria.\n\nWith Park's death the mystery of the Niger remained unsolved. Park's theory that the Niger and Congo were the same river became the general opinion in the years after his death. However even while Park was alive, an amateur German geographer named Reichard proposed the Niger delta was the mouth of the river, but his theory was one of many and did not have much currency because the delta had so many small streams it did not appear to be from a great river. In 1821, [[James McQueen (pioneer)|James McQueen]] published a book, the result of 25 years of research, in which he correctly (it would later be seen) laid out the entire course of the Niger, however like Reichard, his theories did not receive much notice. A number of failed expeditions were mounted but the mystery would finally be solved 25 years after Park's death, in 1830. [[Richard Lander]] and his brother became the first Europeans to follow the course of the Niger from source to ocean.{{sfn|Maclachlan|1898|p=[https://archive.org/details/mungopark00maclrich/page/130 130-142]}}\n\n==Medal==\nThe [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] award the [[Mungo Park Medal]] annually in Park's honour.<ref name=\"RSGS\" />\n\n==In media==\nMungo Park appears as one of the two protagonists in the novel ''[[Water Music (novel)|Water Music]]'' by [[T.
