Yarnal, and B. L. Turner Ii. 2003. The Human Dimensions of Global Change. In Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, eds. G. L. Gaile and C. J. Willmott, 267-282. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> These five main divers of global change can stem from [[Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways|socioeconomic]] factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard.\u00a0 Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops. \u00a0In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lambin, E. F., B. L. Turner Ii, J. Helmut, S. Agbola, A. Angelsen, J. Bruce, O. Coomes, R. Dirzo, G. Fischer, C. Folke, P. George, K. Homewood, J. Imbernon, R. Leemans, X. Li, E. Moran, M. Mortimore, R.

Global Environmental Change 11:261-269.</ref> These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level.\n\nAn example of how socioeconomic drivers affect [[Climate change|climate change]] can be seen in the [[Soybean|soy bean trading]] between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to [[Brazil]] and [[China]] has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., V. Hull, M. Batistella, R. DeFries, T. Dietz, F. Fu, T. W. Hertel, R. C. Izaurralde, E. F. Lambin, S. Li, L. A. Martinelli, W. J. McConnell, E. F. Moran, R. Naylor, Z. Ouyang, K. R. Polenske, A. Reenberg, G. de Miranda Rocha, C. S. Simmons, P. H. Verburg, P. M. Vitousek, F. Zhang, and C. Zhu. 2013. Framing Sustainability in a Telecoupled World. Ecology and Society 18 (2).</ref> All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Turner Ii, B. L., and W. Meyer. 1994. Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change: An Overview. In Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, eds. W. Meyer and B. L. Turner Ii, 3-9. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn\u2019t only happening in Brazil with soy bean production.\n[[File:Crawfish Farming - Acadia Parish Louisiana 2020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nAnother example came from The [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009]] Union when they mandated [[biofuel]] development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna's into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eakin, H., DeFries, R., Kerr, S., Lambin, E. F., Liu, J., Marcotullio, P. J., ... Zimmerer, K. (2014). Significance of telecoupling for exploration of land-use change. In ''Rethinking Global Land Use in an Urban Era'' (pp. 141-161). MIT Press.</ref> Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don\u2019t all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn't only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand's agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects. [[Opium replacement]]\n\nFor instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., T. Dietz, S. R. Carpenter, M. Alberti, C. Folke, E. Moran, A. N. Pell, P. Deadman, T. Kratz, J. Lubchenco, E. Ostrom, Z. Ouyang, W. Provencher, C. L. Redman, S. H. Schneider, and W. W. Taylor. 2007. Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Science 317 (5844):1513- 1516</ref>\n\nHowever, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Stockholm Environment Institute. ''Linking Global and Local Scenarios under Climate Change''. Stockholm Environment Institute, 2003, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep00343. Accessed 12 Mar. 2020.\n</ref> With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can\u2019t meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes. The main concept to take away from this is the idea that everything is connected and that our roles and choices as humans have major driving forces that impact our world in numerous ways.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accidental injury]]\n* [[Ecophysiology]]\n* [[Environmental disease]]\n* [[Envirome]]\n* [[Epidemiology]]\n* [[Epidemiology of cancer]]\n* [[Exposure science]]\n* [[Heritability]]\n* [[Hygiene hypothesis]]\n* [[Occupational toxicology]]\n* [[Public health]]\n* [[Quantitative genetics]]\n* [[Toxicology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/177153.php \"TAU Expert Reviews Environmental Triggers (hairspray!

Yarnal, and B. L. Turner Ii. 2003. The Human Dimensions of Global Change. In Geography in America at the Dawn of the 21st Century, eds. G. L. Gaile and C. J. Willmott, 267-282. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> These five main divers of global change can stem from [[Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways|socioeconomic]] factors which in turn, these can be seen as drivers in their own regard.\u00a0 Socioeconomic drivers of climate change can be triggered by a social or economic demand for resources such as a demand for timber or a demand for agricultural crops. \u00a0In tropical deforestation for instance, the main driver is economic opportunities that come the extraction of these resources and the conversion of this land to crop or rangelands. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Lambin, E. F., B. L. Turner Ii, J. Helmut, S. Agbola, A. Angelsen, J. Bruce, O. Coomes, R. Dirzo, G. Fischer, C. Folke, P. George, K. Homewood, J. Imbernon, R. Leemans, X. Li, E. Moran, M. Mortimore, R.

Global Environmental Change 11:261-269.</ref> These drivers can be manifested at any level, from the global level demand for timber all the way to the household level.\n\nAn example of how socioeconomic drivers affect [[Climate change|climate change]] can be seen in the [[Soybean|soy bean trading]] between Brazil and China. The trading of soy beans from to [[Brazil]] and [[China]] has grown immensely in the past few decades. This growth in trade between these two countries is stimulated by socioeconomic drivers. Some of the socioeconomic drivers in play here are the rising demand for Brazilian soy beans in China, the increase in land use change for soy bean production in Brazil, and the importance of strengthening foreign trade between the two countries. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., V. Hull, M. Batistella, R. DeFries, T. Dietz, F. Fu, T. W. Hertel, R. C. Izaurralde, E. F. Lambin, S. Li, L. A. Martinelli, W. J. McConnell, E. F. Moran, R. Naylor, Z. Ouyang, K. R. Polenske, A. Reenberg, G. de Miranda Rocha, C. S. Simmons, P. H. Verburg, P. M. Vitousek, F. Zhang, and C. Zhu. 2013. Framing Sustainability in a Telecoupled World. Ecology and Society 18 (2).</ref> All of these socioeconomic drivers have implications in climate change. For instance, an increase in the development for soy bean croplands in Brazil means there needs to be more and more land made available for this resource. This causes the general land cover of forest to be converted into croplands which in its own regard has an impact on the environment. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Turner Ii, B. L., and W. Meyer. 1994. Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change: An Overview. In Changes in Land Use and Land Cover: A Global Perspective, eds. W. Meyer and B. L. Turner Ii, 3-9. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>This example of land use change driven by a demand of a resource, isn\u2019t only happening in Brazil with soy bean production.\n[[File:Crawfish Farming - Acadia Parish Louisiana 2020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nAnother example came from The [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009]] Union when they mandated [[biofuel]] development for countries within their membership. With an international socioeconomic driver of increasing the production biofuels comes affects in land use in these countries. When agricultural cropland shift to bioenergy cropland the original crop supply decreases while the global market for this crop increases. This causes a cascading socioeconomic driver for the need for more agricultural croplands to support the growing demand. However, with the lack of available land from the crop substitution to biofuels, countries must look into areas further away to develop these original croplands. This causes spillover systems in countries where this new development takes place. For instance, African countries are converting savanna's into cropland and this all stems from the socioeconomic driver of wanting to develop biofuels. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Eakin, H., DeFries, R., Kerr, S., Lambin, E. F., Liu, J., Marcotullio, P. J., ... Zimmerer, K. (2014). Significance of telecoupling for exploration of land-use change. In ''Rethinking Global Land Use in an Urban Era'' (pp. 141-161). MIT Press.</ref> Furthermore, socioeconomic driver that cause land use change don\u2019t all occur at an international level. These drivers can be experienced all the way down to the household level. Crop substitution doesn't only come from biofuel shifts in agriculture, a big substitution came from Thailand when they switched the production of opium poppy plants to non-narcotic crops. This caused Thailand's agricultural sector to grow, but it caused global rippling effects. [[Opium replacement]]\n\nFor instance, in Wolong China, locals use forests as fuelwood to cook and heat their homes. So, the socioeconomic driver in play here is the local demand for timber to support subsistence in this area. With this driver, locals are depleting their supply for fuelwood so they have to keep moving further away to extract this resource. This movement and demand for timber is in turn contributing to the loss of pandas in this area because their ecosystem is getting destroyed. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Liu, J., T. Dietz, S. R. Carpenter, M. Alberti, C. Folke, E. Moran, A. N. Pell, P. Deadman, T. Kratz, J. Lubchenco, E. Ostrom, Z. Ouyang, W. Provencher, C. L. Redman, S. H. Schneider, and W. W. Taylor. 2007. Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems. Science 317 (5844):1513- 1516</ref>\n\nHowever, when researching local trends the focus tends to be on outcomes instead of on how changes in the global drivers affect outcomes. <ref>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Stockholm Environment Institute. ''Linking Global and Local Scenarios under Climate Change''. Stockholm Environment Institute, 2003, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep00343. Accessed 12 Mar. 2020.\n</ref> With this being said, community level planning needs to be implemented when analyzing socioeconomic drivers of change.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see how socioeconomic drivers at any level play a role in the consequences of human actions on the environment. These drivers all have cascading effects on land, humans, resources, and the environment as a whole. With this being said, humans need to fully understand how their socioeconomic drivers can change the way we live. For instance, going back to the soy bean example, when the supply can\u2019t meet the demand for soy beans the global market for this crop increases which then in turn affects countries that rely on this crop for a food source. These affects can cause a higher price for soy beans at their stores and markets or it can cause an overall lack of availability for this crop in importing countries. With both of these outcomes, the household level is being affected by a national level socioeconomic driver of an increased demand for Brazilian soy beans in China. From just this one example alone, one can see how socioeconomic drivers influence changes at a national level that then lead to more global, regional, communal, and household level changes. The main concept to take away from this is the idea that everything is connected and that our roles and choices as humans have major driving forces that impact our world in numerous ways.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accidental injury]]\n* [[Ecophysiology]]\n* [[Environmental disease]]\n* [[Envirome]]\n* [[Epidemiology]]\n* [[Epidemiology of cancer]]\n* [[Exposure science]]\n* [[Heritability]]\n* [[Hygiene hypothesis]]\n* [[Occupational toxicology]]\n* [[Public health]]\n* [[Quantitative genetics]]\n* [[Toxicology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/177153.php \"TAU Expert Reviews Environmental Triggers (hairspray!

Martin plays a poor waiter. He has many mishaps, including pouring water before placing down the glasses, forcing the couple to repeat their order of \"two martinis\" three times, and subsequently bringing them six martinis. The film culminates with the wife becoming angry that she got dressed up, hired a babysitter and then was brought out to a restaurant with such amazingly bad service. The husband pleads with her: \"Trust me... trust me.\" Immediately afterwards, the waiter returns with their \"change\"\u2014$10,000 worth\u2014before the couple had even paid.

It existed in various forms from 1900 to 1960 but was titled the ''Colonie du Niger'' only from 1922 to 1960.\n\n==Military territory==\nWhile French booty took control of some of the areas of modern Niger began in the 1890s, a formal Zinder Military Territory was formed on 23 July 1900. This military territory only governed what is modern southern Niger, with only nominal rule east of [[Zinder]] or north of [[Tanout]]. Its Commandant was based at the village of [[Sorbo-Haoussa]] near [[Niamey]], where the headquarters was moved in 1903. Administratively, it was part of the [[Senegambia and Niger]] Colony from 1902 to 1904 and [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony from 1904 to 1911. While commanded by officers of the French [[Troupes de marine]], its budget and administration was dependent on the Lieutenant Governor at [[Kayes]] (latter [[Bamako]]), and military decision making\u2014as well as contact with authorities in the [[France|Metropole]] or other colonies was through the Governor General in Dakar.<ref name=newbury1960>Colin Newbury. The formation of the government general of French West Africa. Journal of African history, vol.1, no.1 (1960), pp.111-128.</ref> The area also appears on French maps as the \"''Third Military Territory''\". On 22 June 1910, the territory was renamed [[Niger Military Territory]], and included parts of modern northeast Mali ([[Gao]] Cercle) and Northern Chad ([[Tibesti]] Cercle). On 21 June 1911 the Cercle of [[Gao]] ceded to [[French Sudan]], and throughout the late nineteen-teens, efforts were made to establish permanent French posts in the north and east, in [[Bilma]], [[N'guigmi]] and elsewhere. In 1911, the headquarters of the territory was moved to [[Zinder]], reflecting both the relative peacefulness of the west of the territory, and the fear of incursion from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] to the South and the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] from [[Italian Libya|Libya]]. Despite this, French control of the northern and eastern areas remained minimal. Along with [[Colonial Mauritania|Mauritania]], Niger remained the only part of [[French West Africa]] to remain under military rule.\n\n==Civilian colonial rule==\nOn 13 October 1922, the civilian '''Colony of Niger''' took control of most of southern and western areas, with a lieutenant governor reporting to the [[List of governors of French West Africa|Governor General]] of [[French West Africa]]. The 1919 creation of [[French Upper Volta]] as a civil colony removed the areas of modern Niger west of the [[Niger River]].<ref>See the photo of the 1927 map at [http://www.ambafrance-ne.org/article.php3?id_article=564 Don d\u2019ouvrages aux Archives nationales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217003439/http://www.ambafrance-ne.org/article.php3?id_article=564 |date=2008-02-17 }} from the French Embassy at Niamey, showing the outline of Niger colonie and military territories.</ref> In 1926, the capitol was moved again to [[Niamey]] from [[Zinder]]. In 1930, [[Tibesti]] Cercle ceded to [[French Chad|Chad Colony]] in [[French Equatorial Africa]], and in 1932, the colony of [[French Upper Volta]] was divided amongst its neighbors, with the Cercles of [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]] and [[Fada N'gourma]] ceded to Niger Colony.\n\n==World War II==\nNiger Colony officials, unlike neighboring [[French Chad|Chad]], remained loyal to the French [[Vichy government]] after 1940, and thus closed its southern border (to [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]]) and eastern border until 1944.\n\n==Decolonization==\nOn 31 December 1946 the Military Territories of [[N'Guigmi]] and [[Agadez]] were ceded to Niger Colony, leaving only [[Bilma]] Cercle as the last military-run section of modern Niger. This area in the far north east only came under French civilian administration in 1956.\n\nIn 1947, [[French Upper Volta]] was reconstituted, and the Cercles of [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]] and [[Fada N'Gourma]] ceded to Upper Volta Colony. While there were minor border changes after 1947, the modern borders of Niger were roughly established with this change.\n\nFollowing the 1956 [[Loi Cadre]], rudiments of internal rule were created with the [[Territorial Assembly of Niger]] elected by popular vote, but holding only advisory and administrative powers. In 1958 the [[French Union]] succeed the [[French Community]]\nOn 25 August 1958, the Lieutenant Governor became [[High Commissioner of Niger]], but remained Head of State of a quasi-independent state which controlled some purely internal administration.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Niger|Constitution of 25 February 1959]] was created by and then ratified vote of the [[Constituent Assembly of Niger]], a body created for this purpose from the elected [[Territorial Assembly of Niger]] in December 1958. On 12 March 1959 the Constituent Assembly became the [[Legislative Assembly of Niger]], with the head of government, [[Hamani Diori]], retaining the title of [[Prime Minister of Niger|President of the Council]]. Nominal executive powers were vested in the Assembly, with the constitution establishing elements, such as the [[Flag of Niger]], the [[National anthem of Niger]] and the [[Coat of Arms of Niger]], along with language on naming of political bodies, rights and powers which have been retained in subsequent texts.\n\nFollowing the [[Algerian War]] and the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic]], the colonies of the French Union became fully independent in 1960. Niger ratified its first fully independent constitution on 8 November 1960 and [[Jean Colombani]] stepped down as High Commissioner on 10 November 1960.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Niger]]\n*[[History of Niger]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Niger]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.rulers.org/ruln2.html#niger Niger: Rulers.org].

While commanded by officers of the French [[Troupes de marine]], its budget and administration was dependent on the Lieutenant Governor at [[Kayes]] (latter [[Bamako]]), and military decision making\u2014as well as contact with authorities in the [[France|Metropole]] or other colonies was through the Governor General in Dakar.<ref name=newbury1960>Colin Newbury. The formation of the government general of French West Africa. Journal of African history, vol.1, no.1 (1960), pp.111-128.</ref> The area also appears on French maps as the \"''Third Military Territory''\". On 22 June 1910, the territory was renamed [[Niger Military Territory]], and included parts of modern northeast Mali ([[Gao]] Cercle) and Northern Chad ([[Tibesti]] Cercle). On 21 June 1911 the Cercle of [[Gao]] ceded to [[French Sudan]], and throughout the late nineteen-teens, efforts were made to establish permanent French posts in the north and east, in [[Bilma]], [[N'guigmi]] and elsewhere. In 1911, the headquarters of the territory was moved to [[Zinder]], reflecting both the relative peacefulness of the west of the territory, and the fear of incursion from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] to the South and the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] from [[Italian Libya|Libya]]. Despite this, French control of the northern and eastern areas remained minimal. Along with [[Colonial Mauritania|Mauritania]], Niger remained the only part of [[French West Africa]] to remain under military rule.\n\n==Civilian colonial rule==\nOn 13 October 1922, the civilian '''Colony of Niger''' took control of most of southern and western areas, with a lieutenant governor reporting to the [[List of governors of French West Africa|Governor General]] of [[French West Africa]]. The 1919 creation of [[French Upper Volta]] as a civil colony removed the areas of modern Niger west of the [[Niger River]].<ref>See the photo of the 1927 map at [http://www.ambafrance-ne.org/article.php3?id_article=564 Don d\u2019ouvrages aux Archives nationales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217003439/http://www.ambafrance-ne.org/article.php3?id_article=564 |date=2008-02-17 }} from the French Embassy at Niamey, showing the outline of Niger colonie and military territories.</ref> In 1926, the capitol was moved again to [[Niamey]] from [[Zinder]]. In 1930, [[Tibesti]] Cercle ceded to [[French Chad|Chad Colony]] in [[French Equatorial Africa]], and in 1932, the colony of [[French Upper Volta]] was divided amongst its neighbors, with the Cercles of [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]] and [[Fada N'gourma]] ceded to Niger Colony.\n\n==World War II==\nNiger Colony officials, unlike neighboring [[French Chad|Chad]], remained loyal to the French [[Vichy government]] after 1940, and thus closed its southern border (to [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|Nigeria]]) and eastern border until 1944.\n\n==Decolonization==\nOn 31 December 1946 the Military Territories of [[N'Guigmi]] and [[Agadez]] were ceded to Niger Colony, leaving only [[Bilma]] Cercle as the last military-run section of modern Niger. This area in the far north east only came under French civilian administration in 1956.\n\nIn 1947, [[French Upper Volta]] was reconstituted, and the Cercles of [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]] and [[Fada N'Gourma]] ceded to Upper Volta Colony. While there were minor border changes after 1947, the modern borders of Niger were roughly established with this change.\n\nFollowing the 1956 [[Loi Cadre]], rudiments of internal rule were created with the [[Territorial Assembly of Niger]] elected by popular vote, but holding only advisory and administrative powers. In 1958 the [[French Union]] succeed the [[French Community]]\nOn 25 August 1958, the Lieutenant Governor became [[High Commissioner of Niger]], but remained Head of State of a quasi-independent state which controlled some purely internal administration.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Niger|Constitution of 25 February 1959]] was created by and then ratified vote of the [[Constituent Assembly of Niger]], a body created for this purpose from the elected [[Territorial Assembly of Niger]] in December 1958. On 12 March 1959 the Constituent Assembly became the [[Legislative Assembly of Niger]], with the head of government, [[Hamani Diori]], retaining the title of [[Prime Minister of Niger|President of the Council]]. Nominal executive powers were vested in the Assembly. with the constitution establishing elements, such as the [[Flag of Niger]], the [[National anthem of Niger]] and the [[Coat of Arms of Niger]], along with language on naming of political bodies, rights and powers which have been retained in subsequent texts.\n\nFollowing the [[Algerian War]] and the collapse of the [[French Fourth Republic]], the colonies of the French Union became fully independent in 1960. Niger ratified its first fully independent constitution on 8 November 1960 and [[Jean Colombani]] stepped down as High Commissioner on 10 November 1960.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Niger]]\n*[[History of Niger]]\n*[[List of colonial governors of Niger]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.rulers.org/ruln2.html#niger Niger: Rulers.org].
