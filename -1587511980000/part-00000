With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe their feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.<ref name=\"Fuchs\">{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A.

Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.<ref name=Fuchs /><ref name= \"Zangwill\">{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}</ref> Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a \"learning curve\", and a \"forgetting curve\".<ref>T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \"Unit 7: Memory.\" p. 126</ref> His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.\n\n[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863\u20131930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|author2=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170\u2013174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}</ref> The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli.

James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.<ref name=Matlin />\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596-1650) was a seventeenth-century philosopher who came up with the phrase \"Cogito, ergo sum.\" Which means \"I think, therefore I am.\" He took a philosophical approach to the study of cognition and the mind, with his Meditations he wanted people to meditate along with him to come to the same conclusions as he did but in their own free cognition. <ref>{{cite web |title=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#H3 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Psychology ==\n[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]\nIn psychology, the term \"cognition\" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] (see [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]),<ref name=\"Sternberg2009\">Sternberg, R. J., & Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology (6th Ed.).

It encompasses processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]] and [[mental images|mental imagery]].<ref>''Sensation & Perception'', 5th ed. 1999, Coren, Ward & Enns, p. 9</ref><ref>''Cognitive Psychology'', 5th ed. 1999, Best, John B., pp. 15\u201317</ref> Traditionally, [[emotion]] was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the [[cognitive psychology]] of emotion; research is also focused on one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called [[metacognition]].\n\nWhile few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes (compare [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].\n\n=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===\nFor years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.\n\n[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do \"abstract symbolic reasoning\". His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children. He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|pages=737\u2013745|doi=10.3758/BF03194434|pmid=11436742|issue=4|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Word superiority'''\n\nThe word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|pages=685\u2013694|doi=10.3758/BF03202718|pmid=1435271|issue=6|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Brown-Peterson'''\n\nIn the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|author2=Whiteman, H. |author3=Kelley, M. |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=241\u2013251|doi=10.1080/713755806|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}</ref>\n\n'''Memory span'''\n\nDuring the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|author2=Hasher, L. |author3=Kane, M. |title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759\u2013767|doi=10.3758/BF03198529|issue=5|pmid=10540805|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Visual search'''\n\nIn one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the \"featured\" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the \"conjunctive\" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J. |author2=Cave, K. |author3=Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419\u2013433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419|issue=3|citeseerx=10.1.1.551.1667 }}</ref>\n\n'''Knowledge representation'''\n\nThe [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or \"goodness\" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]]. The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pinker|first=Steven|last2=Bloom|first2=Paul|date=December 1990|title=Natural language and natural selection|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=707\u2013727|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|issn=0140-525X}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent developments ===\nAn emergent field of research, referred to as \"Team Cognition\", is arising in military sciences. \"Team cognition\" indicates \u201can emergent property of teams that results from the interplay of individual cognition and team process behaviors [...] [Team cognition] underlies team performance\u201d (Arizona State University East, 2005, Cooke NJ, 2005).<ref>Russo, M.; Fiedler, E.; Thomas, M.; McGhee (2005),  United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.

With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe their feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.<ref name=\"Fuchs\">{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A.

Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.<ref name=Fuchs /><ref name= \"Zangwill\">{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}</ref> Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a \"learning curve\", and a \"forgetting curve\".<ref>T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \"Unit 7: Memory.\" p. 126</ref> His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.\n\n[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863\u20131930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|author2=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170\u2013174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}</ref> The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli.

James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.<ref name=Matlin />\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596-1650) was a seventeenth-century philosopher who came up with the phrase \"Cogito, ergo sum.\" Which means \"I think, therefore I am.\" He took a philosophical approach to the study of cognition and the mind, with his Meditations he wanted people to meditate along with him to come to the same conclusions as he did but in their own free cognition. <ref>{{cite web |title=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#H3 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Psychology ==\n[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]\nIn psychology, the term \"cognition\" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]] (see [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]),<ref name=\"Sternberg2009\">Sternberg, R.

It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].\n\n=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===\nFor years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.\n\n[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do \"abstract symbolic reasoning\". His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children. He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|pages=737\u2013745|doi=10.3758/BF03194434|pmid=11436742|issue=4|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Word superiority'''\n\nThe word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|pages=685\u2013694|doi=10.3758/BF03202718|pmid=1435271|issue=6|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Brown-Peterson'''\n\nIn the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|author2=Whiteman, H. |author3=Kelley, M. |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|pages=241\u2013251|doi=10.1080/713755806|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}</ref>\n\n'''Memory span'''\n\nDuring the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|author2=Hasher, L. |author3=Kane, M. |title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759\u2013767|doi=10.3758/BF03198529|issue=5|pmid=10540805|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n'''Visual search'''\n\nIn one version of the visual search experiment, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the \"featured\" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the \"conjunctive\" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J. |author2=Cave, K. |author3=Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419\u2013433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419|issue=3|citeseerx=10.1.1.551.1667 }}</ref>\n\n'''Knowledge representation'''\n\nThe [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or \"goodness\" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]].

It was [[settlement (law)|settled]] on the bride (being gifted into [[trust instrument|trust]]) by agreement at the time of the wedding, or as provided by law.\n\nThe dower grew out of the Germanic practice of [[bride price]] ([[Old English]] ''weotuma''), which was given over to a bride's family well in advance for arranging the marriage, but during the early Middle Ages, was given directly to the bride instead. However, in popular parlance, the term may be used for a [[life interest]] in property settled by a husband on his wife at any time, not just at the wedding. The verb [[wikt:dower#Verb|''to dower'']] is sometimes used''.''\n\nIn popular usage, the term ''dower'' may be confused with:\n*A ''[[dowager]]'' is a widow (who may receive her dower). The term is especially used of a noble or royal widow who no longer occupies the position she held during the marriage. For example, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] was technically the [[dowager queen]] after the death of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] (though she was referred to by the more informal title \"[[Queen Mother]]\"), and [[Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland|Princess Lilian]] was the Dowager Duchess of Halland in [[heraldry|heraldic]] parlance. Such a dowager will receive the income from her dower property. (The term \"[[Empress dowager|Empress Dowager]]\", in Chinese history, has a different meaning.)\n*Property brought to the marriage by the bride is called a ''[[dowry]]''.  But the word ''dower'' has been used since [[Chaucer]] (''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'') in the sense of ''dowry'', and is recognized as a definition of ''dower'' in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].\n*Property made over to the bride's family at the time of the wedding is a ''[[bride price]]''. This property does not pass to the bride herself.\n\n==Meaning==\nBeing for the widow and being accorded by law, dower differs essentially from a conventional marriage portion such as the [[England|English]] [[dowry]] (cf.  [[Roman law|Roman]] ''dos'', [[Byzantine law|Byzantine]] ''pro\u00edx'', [[France|French]] ''dot'', Dutch ''bruidsschat'', [[Germany|German]] ''Mitgift'').\n\nThe bride received a right to certain property from the bridegroom or his family. It was intended to ensure her livelihood in widowhood, and it was to be kept separate and in the wife's possession.\n\nDower is the gift given by the groom to the bride, customarily on the morning after the wedding, though all dowerings from the man to his fianc\u00e9e, either during the betrothal period, or wedding, or afterwards, even as late as in the testamentary dowering, are understood as dowers if specifically intended for the maintenance of the widow.\n\nDower was a property arrangement for marriage first used in early medieval German cultures, and the Catholic Church drove its adoption into other countries, in order to improve the wife's security by this ''additional'' benefit. The practice of dower was prevalent in those parts of Europe influenced by [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[Scandinavia]]n culture, such as Sweden, Germany, Normandy and successor states of the Langobardian kingdom.\n\nThe husband was legally prevented from using the wife's dower \u2014 as contrasted with her [[dowry]], which was brought to the marriage by the bride and used by both spouses. This often meant that the woman's legal representative, usually a male relative, became guardian or [[executor]] of the dower, to ensure that it was not squandered.\n\nUsually, the wife was free from kin limitations to use (and bequeath) her dower to whatever and whomever she pleased. It may have become the property of her next marriage, been given to an ecclesiastical institution, or been inherited by her children from other relationships than that from which she received it.\n\n==Types==\nIn English legal history, there were originally five kinds of dower:<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Dower |volume=8|page=457|first=Harold Spencer|last=Scott}}</ref><ref>William Blackstone (2009), The Commentaries of Sir William Blackstone, Knight, on the Laws, Constitution of England; {{ISBN|978-1-60442-719-6}}; pages 105\u2013111</ref> (1) ''ad ostium ecclesiae'', or at the church porch; (2) ''ex assensu patris''; (3) ''de la plus belle''; (4) at common law; (5) by custom.\n\n# ''Dower ad ostium ecclesiae'', was the closest to modern meaning of dower.

It was a legal declaration of a wife's right to property, while the husband lived, which he would manage; which would transfer to the wife's children when they were born; and which would secure her livelihood were she widowed. A dower at common law was not liable for the husband's debts \u2014 which became controversial after many tried to use it to shield their property from the collection of debts. The Dower Acts of 19th century abolished this.\n# Dower by custom was an attempt to recognize the rules of dower customary at each manor and in each region. Customary dowers were also abolished in the 19th century, and replaced with uniform inheritance laws.\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDower is thought to have been suggested by the bride price which [[Tacitus]] found to be usual among the [[Germans]]. This bride price he terms ''dos'', but contrasts it with the ''dos'' (dowry) of the Roman law, which was a gift on the part of the wife to the husband, while in [[Germany]] the gift was made by the husband to the wife.<ref>[[Pierre Larousse|Larousse]], ''[[Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle|Grand dictionnaire universel]]'', Paris, 1870, s.v.

Dower is an outcome of the ecclesiastical practice of exacting from the husband at marriage a promise to endow his wife, a promise retained in form even now in the marriage ritual of the [[Established Church]] in [[England]].<ref>See [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', II, 134, note p.</ref> Dower is mentioned in an ordinance of [[King Philip Augustus]] of [[France]] (1214), and in the almost contemporaneous [[Magna Carta]] (1215); but it seems to have already become customary law in [[Normandy]], [[Sicily]], and [[Naples]], as well as in England. The object of both ordinance and charter was to regulate the amount of the dower where this was not the subject of voluntary arrangement, dower by English law consisting of a wife's life estate in one-third of the lands of the husband \"of which any issue which she might have had might by possibility have been heir\".<ref>Blackstone, ''op. cit.'', 131</ref>\n\n===England and other Common Law Countries===\nThere is judicial authority of the year 1310 for the proposition that dower was favoured by law,<ref>[[Year Books]] of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], London, 1905, Vol. III, 189</ref> and at a less remote period it was said to be with life and liberty one of three things which \"the law favoreth\". In England in the late 18th century, it became common for men to hold land with a trust that prevented their wives' acquiring dower.  Accordingly, the English statute, the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]] was passed to impair the inviolability of dower by empowering husbands to cut off by deed or will their wives from dower. Wives married before the Act still had (in certain cases) to acknowledge the deed before a commissioner to bar their right to dower in property which their husband sold.  This was simpler than the previous procedure, which had required a [[Fine of lands|fine]] to be levied in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], a [[legal fiction|fictitious proceeding]], by which she and her husband formally remitted their right to the property to the purchaser.\n\nIn English law, dower was one third of the lands [[seisin|seised]] in fee by the husband during the marriage. However, in the early modern period, it was common for a wife to bar her right to dower in advance under a marriage settlement, under which she agreed to take instead a [[jointure]], that is a particular interest in her husband's property, either a particular share, or a life interest in a particular part of the land, or an annuity.  This was often part of an arrangement by which she gave up her property to her husband in exchange for her jointure, which would accordingly be greater than a third.  Strictly dower was only available from land that her husband owned, but a life tenant under a settlement was often given power to appoint a [[jointure]] for his wife.  The wife would retain her right to dower (if not barred by a settlement) even if her husband sold the property; however this right could also be barred by a fictitious court proceeding known as levying a fine.  The widow of a [[copyhold]]er was usually provided for by the custom of the [[manorialism|manor]] with [[freebench]], an equivalent right to dower, but often (but not necessarily) a half, rather than a third.\n\n===Scotland===\nUnder [[Scots law]], the part of the estate that cannot be denied to a surviving wife is referred to as [[jus relictae]].\n\n===French Canada===\n{{disputed|section|date=October 2016}}\nOf dower (''douaire'') as it existed in the old French law no trace is to be found in the existing law of France. But brought to [[Canada]] from the mother country in pre-Revolutionary times, customary dower accruing by operation of law is yet recognized in the law of the former French province of [[Quebec]]. The civil death which by English law seems to have applied to men only, might be by the French law incurred by women taking perpetual religious vows. Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income.<ref>See Larousse, ''op. cit.''</ref> And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss of dower.\n\n===United States===\nIt was the law of dower unimpaired by statute which, according to the [[United States|American]] commentator [[Chancellor Kent]], has been \"with some modifications everywhere adopted as part of the municipal jurisprudence of the [[United States]]\".<ref>''Commentaries on [[Law of the United States|American Law]]'', IV, 36</ref>   See ''Scribner on Dower''.<ref>Charles H.

II, 121</ref> consequently his heirs inherited his land forthwith as though he had died a natural death. Assignment of dower in his hand would nevertheless be postponed until the natural death of such a man, for only by his wife's consent could a married man be legally professed in religion, and she was not allowed by her consent to exchange her husband for dower. After the Reformation and the enactment of the English statute of 11 and 12 [[William III of England|William III]], prohibiting \"papists\" from inheriting or purchasing lands, a [[Roman Catholic]] widow was not held to be debarred of dower, for dower accruing by operation of law was deemed to be not within the prohibitions of the statute. By a curious disability of old English law a [[Jewish]] widow born in England would be debarred of dower in land which her husband, he having been an Englishman of the same faith and becoming converted after marriage, should purchase, if she herself remained unconverted.\n\n==Morganatic marriage: a post-medieval application==\nSome well-born persons have been prone to marry an ineligible spouse. Particularly in European countries where the equal birth of spouses (''Ebenb\u00fcrtigkeit'') was an important condition to marriages of dynasts of reigning houses and high nobility, the old matrimonial and contractual law provision of dowering was taken into a new use by institutionalizing the [[morganatic marriage]]. Marriage being morganatical prevents the passage of the husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage.\n\n''Morganatic'', from the [[Latin]] phrase ''matrimonium ad morganaticam'', refers to the dower (Latin: ''morganaticum'', German: ''Morgengabe'', Swedish: ''morgong\u00e5va'' ). When a marriage contract is made that the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or patrimony or from his clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as \"marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance\", i.e. ''matrimonium ad morganaticum''.\n\nNeither the bride nor any children of the marriage has any right on the groom's titles, rights, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate on other counts and the prohibition of [[polygamy|bigamy]] applies.\n\nThe practice of \"only-doweried\" is close to [[pre-nuptial contract]]s excluding the spouse from property, though children are usually not affected by prenuptials, whereas they certainly were by morganatical marriage.\n\nMorganatic marriage contained an agreement that the wife and the children born of the marriage will not receive anything further than what was agreed in pre-nuptials, and in some cases may have been zero, or something nominal. Separate nobility titles were given to morganatic wives of dynasts of reigning houses, but it sometimes included no true property. This sort of dower was far from the original purpose of the bride receiving a settled property from the bridegroom's clan, in order to ensure her livelihood in widowhood.\n\nThe practice of morganatic marriage was most common in historical [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]], where equality of birth between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility. Morganatic marriage has not been and is not possible in jurisdictions that do not allow sufficient freedom of contracting, as it is an agreement containing that pre-emptive limitation to the inheritance and property rights of the wife and the children. Marriages have never been considered morganatic in any part of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==In Islam==\n{{main|Mahr}}\nThe payment from the groom to the bride is a mandatory condition for all valid [[Nikah|Muslim marriages]]: a man must pay mahr (donatio propter nuptias in Latin) to his bride. It is the duty of the husband to pay as stated in the Qu'ran (Sura Al-Nisaa\u2019 verses 4 and 20\u201324), although often his family may assist, and by agreement can be in promissory form, i.e. in the event the husband pronounces [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_6.php|title=Islams Women \u2013 Fiqh of Marriage \u2013 Dowry|publisher=islamswomen.com}}</ref> It is considered a gift which the bride has to agree on. The mahr can be any value as long as it is agreed upon by both parties. When the groom gives his bride the mahr, it becomes her property.\n\nIf the mahr was in promissory form then upon [[Islamic divorce|divorce]], the mahr becomes payable if the husband initiated the divorce ([[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]]). If it was previously paid a woman is entitled to keep her mahr. However, if the woman initiates the divorce (in the procedure called [[khula]]), the circumstances of the breakup become relevant. If the divorce is sought for cause; meaning, in an Islamic context, her husband's abuse, illness, impotence, or infidelity, the woman is generally considered to have the right to keep the mahr; however, if the divorce is not sought for a generally accepted cause, the husband may request its return. {{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe amount promised or paid to the bride forms part of her personal property and is of assistance to her in times of financial need, such as a divorce or desertion by the husband. While the mahr is usually in the form of cash, it may also be a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she so chooses.\n\n==In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\nAccording to the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas]], the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]'s most holy book, the dower is paid from the groom to the bride. The dower, if the husband lives in a city, is nineteen [http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/glossary.html#Mithqal mithq\u00e1ls] (approx. 2.2 [[troy ounce]]s) of pure gold, or, if the husband lives outside a city, the same amount in silver.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Curtesy]]\n*[[Elective Share]]\n*[[Jointure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{catholic|wstitle=Dower|author=Charles William Sloane}}\n*[[Georges Duby]], ''The Knight, The Lady, and the Priest'' (1981).\n\n[[Category:Property law]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Dowry|Dour}}\n{{for|the surname|Dower (surname)}}\n{{Close Relationships}}\n[[File:Proikosymfono Kastoria 1905.JPG|thumb|Dower agreement (Proikosymfono) before wedding at Kastoria, Greece, (1905).

It was [[settlement (law)|settled]] on the bride (being gifted into [[trust instrument|trust]]) by agreement at the time of the wedding, or as provided by law.\n\nThe dower grew out of the Germanic practice of [[bride price]] ([[Old English]] ''weotuma''), which was given over to a bride's family well in advance for arranging the marriage, but during the early Middle Ages, was given directly to the bride instead.

Therefore, a widow entering into religion would lose her dower, although in some regions she was allowed to retain a moderate income.<ref>See Larousse, ''op. cit.''</ref> And now by the law of Quebec a widow joining certain religious orders of the province is deemed civilly dead and undoubtedly would suffer loss of dower.\n\n===United States===\nIt was the law of dower unimpaired by statute which, according to the [[United States|American]] commentator [[Chancellor Kent]], has been \"with some modifications everywhere adopted as part of the municipal jurisprudence of the [[United States]]\".<ref>''Commentaries on [[Law of the United States|American Law]]'', IV, 36</ref>   See ''Scribner on Dower''.<ref>Charles H. Scribner, ''A Treatise on the Law of Dower, in Two Volumes'', T. & J. W.

II, 121</ref> consequently his heirs inherited his land forthwith as though he had died a natural death. Assignment of dower in his hand would nevertheless be postponed until the natural death of such a man, for only by his wife's consent could a married man be legally professed in religion, and she was not allowed by her consent to exchange her husband for dower. After the Reformation and the enactment of the English statute of 11 and 12 [[William III of England|William III]], prohibiting \"papists\" from inheriting or purchasing lands, a [[Roman Catholic]] widow was not held to be debarred of dower, for dower accruing by operation of law was deemed to be not within the prohibitions of the statute. By a curious disability of old English law a [[Jewish]] widow born in England would be debarred of dower in land which her husband, he having been an Englishman of the same faith and becoming converted after marriage, should purchase, if she herself remained unconverted.\n\n==Morganatic marriage: a post-medieval application==\nSome well-born persons have been prone to marry an ineligible spouse. Particularly in European countries where the equal birth of spouses (''Ebenb\u00fcrtigkeit'') was an important condition to marriages of dynasts of reigning houses and high nobility, the old matrimonial and contractual law provision of dowering was taken into a new use by institutionalizing the [[morganatic marriage]]. Marriage being morganatical prevents the passage of the husband's titles and privileges to the wife and any children born of the marriage.\n\n''Morganatic'', from the [[Latin]] phrase ''matrimonium ad morganaticam'', refers to the dower (Latin: ''morganaticum'', German: ''Morgengabe'', Swedish: ''morgong\u00e5va'' ). When a marriage contract is made that the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or patrimony or from his clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as \"marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance\", i.e. ''matrimonium ad morganaticum''.\n\nNeither the bride nor any children of the marriage has any right on the groom's titles, rights, or entailed property. The children are considered legitimate on other counts and the prohibition of [[polygamy|bigamy]] applies.\n\nThe practice of \"only-doweried\" is close to [[pre-nuptial contract]]s excluding the spouse from property, though children are usually not affected by prenuptials, whereas they certainly were by morganatical marriage.\n\nMorganatic marriage contained an agreement that the wife and the children born of the marriage will not receive anything further than what was agreed in pre-nuptials, and in some cases may have been zero, or something nominal. Separate nobility titles were given to morganatic wives of dynasts of reigning houses, but it sometimes included no true property. This sort of dower was far from the original purpose of the bride receiving a settled property from the bridegroom's clan, in order to ensure her livelihood in widowhood.\n\nThe practice of morganatic marriage was most common in historical [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]], where equality of birth between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility. Morganatic marriage has not been and is not possible in jurisdictions that do not allow sufficient freedom of contracting, as it is an agreement containing that pre-emptive limitation to the inheritance and property rights of the wife and the children. Marriages have never been considered morganatic in any part of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==In Islam==\n{{main|Mahr}}\nThe payment from the groom to the bride is a mandatory condition for all valid [[Nikah|Muslim marriages]]: a man must pay mahr (donatio propter nuptias in Latin) to his bride. It is the duty of the husband to pay as stated in the Qu'ran (Sura Al-Nisaa\u2019 verses 4 and 20\u201324), although often his family may assist, and by agreement can be in promissory form, i.e. in the event the husband pronounces [[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_6.php|title=Islams Women - Fiqh of Marriage - Dowry|publisher=islamswomen.com}}</ref> It is considered a gift which the bride has to agree on. The mahr can be any value as long as it is agreed upon by both parties. When the groom gives his bride the mahr, it becomes her property.\n\nIf the mahr was in promissory form then upon [[Islamic divorce|divorce]], the mahr becomes payable if the husband initiated the divorce ([[Divorce (Islamic)|talaq]]). If it was previously paid a woman is entitled to keep her mahr. However, if the woman initiates the divorce (in the procedure called [[khula]]), the circumstances of the breakup become relevant. If the divorce is sought for cause; meaning, in an Islamic context, her husband's abuse, illness, impotence, or infidelity, the woman is generally considered to have the right to keep the mahr; however, if the divorce is not sought for a generally accepted cause, the husband may request its return. {{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe amount promised or paid to the bride forms part of her personal property and is of assistance to her in times of financial need, such as a divorce or desertion by the husband. While the mahr is usually in the form of cash, it may also be a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she so chooses.\n\n==In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\nAccording to the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas]], the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]'s most holy book, the dower is paid from the groom to the bride. The dower, if the husband lives in a city, is nineteen [http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/glossary.html#Mithqal mithq\u00e1ls] (approx. 2.2 [[troy ounce]]s) of pure gold, or, if the husband lives outside a city, the same amount in silver.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Curtesy]]\n*[[Elective Share]]\n*[[Jointure]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{catholic|wstitle=Dower|author=Charles William Sloane}}\n*[[Georges Duby]], ''The Knight, The Lady, and the Priest'' (1981).\n\n[[Category:Property law]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Family law]]\n", "name_user": "Jerome Kohl", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dower"}

Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955.

Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate, and store construction.  Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company's finances, real estate, and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company president after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became chairman emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.\n\n===Legal case===\nThe Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along [[U.S. Route 220 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 220]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], was the subject of a key 1960s [[United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the \"public forum doctrine.\"  The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the \"shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district\" of a city.<ref>Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308 (1968).</ref> At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in [[Logan Valley Mall]], the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid-1970s, at which time Weis moved across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.\n\n==Banners==\nIn addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in 1993 (Mr.Z's) and 1994 (King's).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shope|first=Dan|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1994-06-26-2970465-story.html|title=WEIS BUYS KING'S SIX MARKETS|date=June 26, 1994|work=The Morning Call|access-date=February 11, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news | last=Zwiebach | first=Elliot | url=https://www.supermarketnews.com/archive/weis-construct-10-new-stores | title=WEIS TO CONSTRUCT 10 NEW STORES | work=[[Supermarket News]] | date=April 25, 1994}}</ref> Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced.

At one time, the company operated a few stores as '''Big-Top Market''', but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.\n\n==Competition==\nWeis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, [[Walmart]] and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. [[Giant-Carlisle|Giant (Carlisle)]], a supermarket chain owned by [[Ahold]], began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nWeis also faces tough competition in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], from [[Stauffer's of Kissel Hill]].\n   \nIn Maryland, Weis competes with [[Walmart]], [[Acme Market|Acme]], [[Giant Eagle]], [[Food Lion]], [[Harris Teeter]], Safeway, [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]] and [[Giant-Landover|Giant (Landover)]].\n\nIn New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]], Stop & Shop and Acme.\n\nIn New York, Weis's competition includes [[Price Chopper Supermarkets|Price Chopper]] and [[Wegmans]].\n\nIn 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.\n\nWeis also has a very smooth organic ketchup, which consumers have noted is not as good as the organic ketchup at Wegmans, Whole Foods, and other grocery stores. \n\n==Private brand labels==\nWeis Markets sells a variety of house brands under the following private brand labels:\n\n*Weis Quality (Advertised as equivalent to national brands)\n*Weis Organic (Organic Fruits and Vegetables)\n*Weis Signature (Premium)\n*Weis Quality Premium Meats (Deli Meat)\n*ValuTime (Discount brand guaranteed to be cheapest in the area)\n*Paws Premium (Dog food)\n*TopCare (Health and Beauty Care Products)\n*Full Circle (Fair-Trade Certified food)\n*Weis 360 (Organic staples such as oatmeal and bread)\n*Weis Simply Great\n\n==Corporate officers==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Jonathan Weis&nbsp;\u2013 chairman, president, and chief executive officer\n* Kurt Schertle, chief operating officer\n* Scott Frost&nbsp;\u2013 senior vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer\n* David Gose, senior vice president of operations\n* Richard Gunn, senior vice president of merchandising and marketing\n* Jim Marcil&nbsp;\u2013 senior vice president of human resources\n* Harold Graber&nbsp;\u2013 senior vice president for real estate and development\n* Wayne Bailey, senior vice president of supply chain and logistics\n* Bob Gleeson - vice president, fresh merchandising\n* Donna Banks-Ficcio - vice president, center store sales and merchandising\n* Ron Bonacci, vice president of marketing and advertising\n* R.

Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate, and store construction.  Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company's finances, real estate, and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company president after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became chairman emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.\n\n===Legal case===\nThe Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along [[U.S. Route 220 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 220]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], was the subject of a key 1960s [[United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the \"public forum doctrine.\"  The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the \"shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district\" of a city.<ref>Amalgamated Food Employees Union v.

Before [[over fishing]] killed its fishery, Peru had the world's most productive fishery due to the cold Current. It lifts nutrients from the Pacific floor to surface waters. On land, it results in a cold mist that covers coastal Peru to the extent that desert plants have adapted to obtain water from the air instead of from (infrequent) rainfall. The wet side soil is thin, while few rivers operate on the dry side. This means all the water must be brought from the Atlantic side of the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges that split Peru.\n\nMany obstacles limited Peru's agricultural production. Peru has always been rich in [[natural resources]] such as [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[guano]] and [[rubber]]. These resources were found, not grown. Train tracks did not connect its peoples; instead they connected the sources of these valuable resources to the sea. So few ways helped to bring agricultural products to market.\n\nThe road system is underdeveloped in Peru, e.g., offering no connection to neighboring [[Brazil]]. Only a little over a quarter of the 15th-century [[Inca road system]] has been modernized. Another obstacle is the large size of Peru's informal economy. This prevents Peru from relying on an income tax to run the government. Much of its revenue instead comes from a 13% tax on gross agricultural sales. This squeezes Peruvian farmers who must compete with farmers in countries that tax farmers on net profit. No profit, no tax.\n\nTwenty-first century Peru grows agricultural commodities such as [[asparagus]], [[potato]]es, [[maize]], [[rice]], [[quinoa]] and [[coffee]].<ref name=\"CIA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html|title=The World Factbook  - South America :: Peru |website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Peru provides half of the world supply of [[quinoa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#VISUALIZE_BY_DOMAIN |title=FAOSTAT |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] Statistics |accessdate=2013-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401115157/http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html |archivedate=2013-04-01 }}</ref>  Peruvian agriculture uses synthetic fertilizers rather than still-abundant guano due to infrastructure issues. Peruvian maize is not exportable due to large producer subsidies in Europe and the United States. Coffee is exportable, because little is grown in those countries.

Retrieved 7 January 2010.</ref> Peru does not have a quality control program such as [[Kenya]]'s, but its government has worked to educate farmers on how to improve quality.

This is shady stuff.\n\n==Aqueducts and terraces==\n[[File:Cumbemayo aqueduct.JPG|thumb|left|Aqueduct at Cumbe Mayo]][[File:Puquios aqueduct Nazca Peru.JPG|thumb|right|An entrance to Nazca's Puquios]]\nThe ancient people of Peru built water-moving and preserving technologies like the [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of [[Cumbe Mayo]] ([[circa|c.]] 1500 BCE) and the [[Nazca]]'s underground aqueducts called [[Puquios]] (date uncertain), or the terraced gardens of the [[Huari culture|Huari]]. Aqueducts were also utilized by the Moche.{{sfn|Sayer|1999|p=10}}\n\nAnother technique used for farming was [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]]. The [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chavin]],{{sfn|Wood|1996|p= 4}} Moche,{{sfn|Sayer|1999|p=10}} and Incas built terraces, or [[anden]]es, into the sides of hills.

These terraces are still used.<ref>Sayer, page 25.</ref> Incans irrigated their fields with a system of reservoirs and cisterns to collect water, which was then distributed by canals and ditches.{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=18}}\n\nHowever, by the mid-19th century, only 3% of Peru's land was still farmable. It lagged behind many other South American countries in agriculture.\n\n==Guano==\nIn the 19th century the [[Inca]] fertilizer [[guano]] ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpetre]]) became the most important resource in Peru's modern history, for its use as a fertilizer and as [[gunpowder]].<ref name=\"Salon.com\">Leonard, Andrew.[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/02/29/guano_imperialism/ \"When guano imperialists ruled the earth\"].

On land, it results in a cold mist that covers coastal Peru to the extent that desert plants have adapted to obtain water from the air instead of from (infrequent) rainfall. The wet side soil is thin, while few rivers operate on the dry side. This means all the water must be brought from the Atlantic side of the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges that split Peru.\n\nMany obstacles limited Peru's agricultural production. Peru has always been rich in [[natural resources]] such as [[tin]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[guano]] and [[rubber]]. These resources were found, not grown. Train tracks did not connect its peoples; instead they connected the sources of these valuable resources to the sea. So few ways helped to bring agricultural products to market.\n\nThe road system is underdeveloped in Peru, e.g., offering no connection to neighboring [[Brazil]]. Only a little over a quarter of the 15th-century [[Inca road system]] has been modernized. Another obstacle is the large size of Peru's informal economy. This prevents Peru from relying on an income tax to run the government. Much of its revenue instead comes from a 13% tax on gross agricultural sales. This squeezes Peruvian farmers who must compete with farmers in countries that tax farmers on net profit. No profit, no tax.\n\nTwenty-first century Peru grows agricultural commodities such as [[asparagus]], [[potato]]es, [[maize]], [[rice]], [[quinoa]] and [[coffee]].<ref name=\"CIA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html|title=The World Factbook  - South America :: Peru |website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Peru provides half of the world supply of [[quinoa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#VISUALIZE_BY_DOMAIN |title=FAOSTAT |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] Statistics |accessdate=2013-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401115157/http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html |archivedate=2013-04-01 }}</ref>  Peruvian agriculture uses synthetic fertilizers rather than still-abundant guano due to infrastructure issues. Peruvian maize is not exportable due to large producer subsidies in Europe and the United States. Coffee is exportable, because little is grown in those countries. In recent years Peru has become the world's primary source of high-quality [[organic coffee]].<ref name=\"USDA\">[http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200805/146294603.pdf \"Peru: Organic Products Update 2008\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018233116/http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200805/146294603.pdf |date=2012-10-18 }}.

Retrieved 7 January 2010.</ref> Peru does not have a quality control program such as [[Kenya]]'s, but its government has worked to educate farmers on how to improve quality. Despite the glut of coffee in the market today, coffee production in Peru's unusual high altitudes and partial shade is allows ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' to flourish, and it has much more of such land available than competitors such as [[Jamaica]] and Hawaii.\n\n==Aqueducts and terraces==\n[[File:Cumbemayo aqueduct.JPG|thumb|left|Aqueduct at Cumbe Mayo]][[File:Puquios aqueduct Nazca Peru.JPG|thumb|right|An entrance to Nazca's Puquios]]\nThe ancient people of Peru built water-moving and preserving technologies like the [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] of [[Cumbe Mayo]] ([[circa|c.]] 1500 BCE) and the [[Nazca]]'s underground aqueducts called [[Puquios]] (date uncertain), or the terraced gardens of the [[Huari culture|Huari]]. Aqueducts were also utilized by the Moche.{{sfn|Sayer|1999|p=10}}\n\nAnother technique used for farming was [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]]. The [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chavin]],{{sfn|Wood|1996|p= 4}} Moche,{{sfn|Sayer|1999|p=10}} and Incas built terraces, or [[anden]]es, into the sides of hills. The andenes reduced erosion that would normally damage a steep hill. These terraces are still used.<ref>Sayer, page 25.</ref> Incans irrigated their fields with a system of reservoirs and cisterns to collect water, which was then distributed by canals and ditches.{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=18}}\n\nHowever, by the mid-19th century, only 3% of Peru's land was still farmable. It lagged behind many other South American countries in agriculture.\n\n==Guano==\nIn the 19th century the [[Inca]] fertilizer [[guano]] ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpetre]]) became the most important resource in Peru's modern history, for its use as a fertilizer and as [[gunpowder]].<ref name=\"Salon.com\">Leonard, Andrew.[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2008/02/29/guano_imperialism/ \"When guano imperialists ruled the earth\"].

The supervisors in Atlantic City were aware of the flaws and did nothing to correct them, sending the message to the members of their department that they would not be disciplined no matter how egregious the violation. Their confidence that they could assault citizens without fear of disciplinary action is best evidenced in the way that they assaulted and treated numerous individuals while fully aware that they were being recorded by casino surveillance cameras, and that even with such recorded evidence Internal Affairs would review the footage and exonerate them.\nAtlantic City's Internal Affairs process was characterized as the exact \"facade to cover the violent behavioral patterns of police officers under investigation, to protect them from disciplinary action, and thereby perpetuate the City's custom of acquiescing in the excessive use of force by its police, the prior Chief testified that Internal Affairs: (1) reviews all internal complaints made against its officers, regardless of outcome, for evidence of pattern of misconduct; and (2) are required to review target officer's prior and subsequent Internal Affairs complaints to see if an officer has a pattern of misconduct. the prior Internal Affairs Captain specifically contradicted the Chief, testifying that the department did not have a \"regular practice\" to review an officer's prior and subsequent complaints to determine if a pattern of misconduct might exist, and did not do so on \"a regular basis, this being in direct conflict with the New Jersey Attorney General's Guidelines for Internal Affairs Policy and Procedure, further testimony by the Chief And Captain revealed that the department's Internal Affairs Unit did not interview officers under investigation, resulting (not surprisingly) in either \"Exonerated\" or \"Not Sustained\" findings. Such shallow and inadequate investigations into police misconduct is direct evidence of deliberate indifference on the part of Atlantic City and its police department's staff and would most likely be sufficient to impose municipal liability on them.\nThe Chief and Captain testified that officers were not routinely interviewed by Internal Affairs, and that the interview requirement in the Attorney General's Guidelines was \"a suggestion\" based on the \"operative word \"should\", The Guidelines are clear that Internal Affairs should interview the officers under investigation as well as the Complainants and the Chief testified that the Guidelines provision that \"Investigators should interview the complainant, all witnesses and the subject officer\" was \"a suggestion\" and not \"a requirement\". The Internal Affairs Captain also disagreed with the provision, characterizing it as a \"guideline\" rather than a \"requirement\" based on the operative word \"should.\" the Internal Affairs Captain considered the Guideline provision to be \"an opinion.\" however the captain contradicted himself in other testimony that according to Atlantic City Police Internal guidelines \"all efforts must be made to interview a complainant in person.\" The Guidelines are clear that Internal Affairs should review prior and subsequent Internal Affairs reports every time a complaint is brought against an officer as part of an Early Warning System, there was in fact a reasonable expectation that the word \"should\" clearly indicated an obligation or duty or requirement.<ref>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT COURT OF NEW JERSEY CAMDEN Forero vs. Atlantic City,  Civil Action No.:11-01630 (JHR-AMD)</ref>\n\nIn July 2015 Atlantic City Police Sergeant Kiyia Harris was arrested by FBI Agents and charged with lying to federal authorities in reference to her relationship and dealings with a convicted drug dealer boyfriend .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Sergeant-Police-Officer-Drug-Dealer-Atlantic-City-FBI-Kiyia-Harris-314766751.html|title=Sgt.

Only incidents that have had some sort of finding of misconduct. See BLP -->\nOn 23 November 2009, two Atlantic City policemen stopped two men on the street and detained them. The two officers reportedly made racial insults directed toward the men. An internal affairs investigation found the officers acted correctly. In October 2011, the two officers agreed to pay $360,000 to the men for violating their civil rights. Local newspapers did not name the two officers.<ref>Two Atlantic City police officers found guilty of civil rights violations against two men, settlement amount reduced, by Lynda Cohen, 24 October 2014, Press of Atlantic City website</ref>\n\nIn June 2013, David Connor Castellani alleged police brutality after a verbal confrontation characterized in court as \"Mouthing Off\" to several police officers became an alleged act of \"Street Justice\" the officers were found to have acted correctly, as technically under the letter of the law, if Castellani had even dropped to the ground and rolled up in a fetal position that could have been considered resisting arrest, and all the actions and the force utilized by the officers would have still been appropriate until Castellani complied with their orders to submit to being taken into custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/gang-atlantic-city-officers-brutally-beat-man-release-an-attack-dog-to-gnaw-on-his-neck/|title=Gang of Atlantic City officers brutally beat man, release an attack dog to gnaw on his neck|first=Site|last=Staff|date=30 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shorenewstoday.com/snt/news/index.php/mainland-/news/44702-linwood-family-suing-atlantic-city-police-for-alleged-use-of-excessive-force-in-sons-arrest-video.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212160857/http://www.shorenewstoday.com/snt/news/index.php/mainland-/news/44702-linwood-family-suing-atlantic-city-police-for-alleged-use-of-excessive-force-in-sons-arrest-video.html |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015 calling for an end to \"incessant discovery disputes\" over Atlantic City Police Department internal affairs files, a federal judge in Camden ordered the city to turn over every internal affairs file it generated from 2003 to 2014\u2014roughly 2,000 files.

The supervisors in Atlantic City were aware of the flaws and did nothing to correct them, sending the message to the members of their department that they would not be disciplined no matter how egregious the violation. Their confidence that they could assault citizens without fear of disciplinary action is best evidenced in the way that they assaulted and treated numerous individuals while fully aware that they were being recorded by casino surveillance cameras, and that even with such recorded evidence Internal Affairs would review the footage and exonerate them.\nAtlantic City's Internal Affairs process was characterized as the exact \"facade to cover the violent behavioral patterns of police officers under investigation, to protect them from disciplinary action, and thereby perpetuate the City's custom of acquiescing in the excessive use of force by its police, the prior Chief testified that Internal Affairs: (1) reviews all internal complaints made against its officers, regardless of outcome, for evidence of pattern of misconduct; and (2) are required to review target officer's prior and subsequent Internal Affairs complaints to see if an officer has a pattern of misconduct. the prior Internal Affairs Captain specifically contradicted the Chief, testifying that the department did not have a \"regular practice\" to review an officer's prior and subsequent complaints to determine if a pattern of misconduct might exist, and did not do so on \"a regular basis, this being in direct conflict with the New Jersey Attorney General's Guidelines for Internal Affairs Policy and Procedure, further testimony by the Chief And Captain revealed that the department's Internal Affairs Unit did not interview officers under investigation, resulting (not surprisingly) in either \"Exonerated\" or \"Not Sustained\" findings. Such shallow and inadequate investigations into police misconduct is direct evidence of deliberate indifference on the part of Atlantic City and its police department's staff and would most likely be sufficient to impose municipal liability on them.\nThe Chief and Captain testified that officers were not routinely interviewed by Internal Affairs, and that the interview requirement in the Attorney General's Guidelines was \"a suggestion\" based on the \"operative word \"should\", The Guidelines are clear that Internal Affairs should interview the officers under investigation as well as the Complainants and the Chief testified that the Guidelines provision that \"Investigators should interview the complainant, all witnesses and the subject officer\" was \"a suggestion\" and not \"a requirement\". The Internal Affairs Captain also disagreed with the provision, characterizing it as a \"guideline\" rather than a \"requirement\" based on the operative word \"should.\" the Internal Affairs Captain considered the Guideline provision to be \"an opinion.\" however the captain contradicted himself in other testimony that according to Atlantic City Police Internal guidelines \"all efforts must be made to interview a complainant in person.\" The Guidelines are clear that Internal Affairs should review prior and subsequent Internal Affairs reports every time a complaint is brought against an officer as part of an Early Warning System, there was in fact a reasonable expectation that the word \"should\" clearly indicated an obligation or duty or requirement.<ref>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT COURT OF NEW JERSEY CAMDEN Forero vs. Atlantic City,  Civil Action No.:11-01630 (JHR-AMD)</ref>\n\nIn July 2015 Atlantic City Police Sergeant Kiyia Harris was arrested by FBI Agents and charged with lying to federal authorities in reference to her relationship and dealings with a convicted drug dealer boyfriend .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Sergeant-Police-Officer-Drug-Dealer-Atlantic-City-FBI-Kiyia-Harris-314766751.html|title=Sgt.
