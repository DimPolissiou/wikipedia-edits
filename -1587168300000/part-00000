It was written for the 1913 Paris season of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] company; the original choreography was by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] with stage designs and costumes by [[Nicholas Roerich]]. When first performed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913, the [[avant-garde]] nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a \"riot\" or \"near-riot,\" though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shaver-Gleason |first1=Linda |title=Did Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring Incite a Riot at Its Premiere? |url=https://notanothermusichistorycliche.blogspot.com/2018/06/did-stravinskys-rite-of-spring-incite.html |website=Not Another Music History Clich\u00e9! |accessdate=7 December 2018 |date=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Levitz |first1=Tamara |title=\"Racism at the Rite,\" in The Rite of Spring at 100 |date=2013 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253024442 |pages=146\u201378}}</ref> Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\n\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. ''The Rite'' was the third such project, after the acclaimed ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]'' (1910) and ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911). The concept behind ''The Rite of Spring'', developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, \"Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts\"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kNMlDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=rite%20of%20spring&f=false|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226224848|language=en}}</ref> Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading ballet-masters, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in Los Angeles.\n\nStravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in [[tonality]], [[metre (music)|metre]], rhythm, [[Accent (music)|stress]] and [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in [[Russian traditional music|Russian folk music]], a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. The music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Igor Stravinsky as drawn by Pablo Picasso 31 Dec 1920 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stravinsky, sketched by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], 1920]]\n[[Igor Stravinsky]] was the son of [[Fyodor Stravinsky]], the principal [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Imperial Opera]], [[St Petersburg]], and Anna, n\u00e9e Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;1: Background and early years, 1882\u20131905|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg1#S52818.1|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] while taking private lessons in harmony and [[counterpoint]]. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908, Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a [[Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor (Stravinsky)|Piano Sonata in F{{music|sharp}} minor]] (1903\u201304), a [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E{{music|flat}} major]] (1907), which he catalogued as \"Opus 1\", and a short orchestral piece, ''[[Feu d'artifice]]'' (\"Fireworks\", composed in 1908).<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;2: Towards ''The Firebird'', 1902\u201309 | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg2#S52818.2|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;11: Posthumous reputation and legacy: Works | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article_works/grove/music/52818pg11#S52818.12|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909 ''Feu d'artifice'' was performed at a concert in St. Petersburg.

To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer [[Michel Fokine]], the designer [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] and the dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent.<ref>{{cite web|last= Griffiths|first= Paul|title= Diaghilev (Dyagilev), Sergey Pavlovich|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08450?q=Diaghilev&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> Having heard ''Feu d'artifice'' he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] to create the ballet ''[[Les Sylphides]]''.

During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21).

Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \"Yarila\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which ''The Rite of Spring'' developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Morton|first= Lawrence|title= Footnotes to Stravinsky Studies: Le Sacre du printemps|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=6072712|journal= Tempo |series=New Series|issue= 128|date= March 1979|pages=9\u201316|doi= 10.1017/S0040298200030539}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>Hill, pp. 102\u2013104</ref> Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of ''The Rite''. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round.<ref>Hill, p. 3</ref> However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of ''L'Oiseau de Feu'' in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision&nbsp;... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\".<ref>Stravinsky, p. 31</ref>\n\nBy May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with [[Nicholas Roerich]], the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the ''Polovtsian Dances''.<ref name=H4 /> The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \"The Great Sacrifice\" (Russian: ''Velikaia zhertva'');<ref name=VdT2>Van den Toorn, p. 2</ref> Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet ''Petrushka''.<ref name=H4>Hill, pp. 4\u20138</ref>\n\nIn July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near [[Smolensk]], where Roerich was staying with the [[Princess Maria Tenisheva]], a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]]''. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 35\u201336</ref> [[Thomas Forrest Kelly|Thomas F. Kelly]], in his history of the ''Rite'' premiere, suggests that the two-part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich.<ref>Kelly, p. 297</ref> Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the ''Russian Musical Gazette'', that the first part of the work would be called \"The Kiss of the Earth\", and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of [[Wise old man|sages]], culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, \"The Sacrifice\", would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages.<ref name=H4 /> The original working title was changed to \"Holy Spring\" (Russian:'' Vesna sviashchennaia''), but the work became generally known by the French translation ''Le Sacre du printemps'', or its English equivalent ''The Rite of Spring'', with the subtitle \"Pictures of Pagan Russia\".<ref name=VdT2 /><ref name=\"Grout and Palisca, p. 713\">Grout and Palisca, p. 713</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:RoyLindmanClarensSwitzerland 005.jpg|thumb|right|Clarens, in Switzerland (modern photograph), where most of ''The Rite of Spring'' was composed]]\nStravinsky's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at [[Ustyluh|Ustilug]] in Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the \"Augurs of Spring\" and the \"Spring Rounds\".<ref name=VdT24>Van den Toorn, p. 24</ref> In October he left Ustilug for [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]] in Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room\u2014an {{convert|8|by|8|ft|m|adj=on}} closet, with only a muted upright piano, a table and two chairs<ref name=\"Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143\">Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143</ref>\u2014he worked throughout the 1911\u201312 winter on the score.<ref name=H13>Hill, p. 13</ref> By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II.<ref name=VdT24 /> He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost,<ref name=H13 /> which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes conductor [[Pierre Monteux]] in April 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 35</ref> He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of ''The Rite''; he and the composer [[Claude Debussy]] played the first half of this together, in June 1912.<ref name=H13 />\n\nFollowing Diaghilev's decision to delay the premiere until 1913, Stravinsky put ''The Rite'' aside during the summer of 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 34</ref> He enjoyed the Paris season, and accompanied Diaghilev to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to attend a performance of ''[[Parsifal]]''.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 37\u201339</ref> Stravinsky resumed work on ''The Rite'' in the autumn; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912.<ref name=VdT24 /> During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score, which he signed and dated as \"completed in Clarens, March 8, 1913\".<ref name=VDT36 /> He showed the manuscript to [[Maurice Ravel]], who was enthusiastic and predicted, in a letter to a friend, that the first performance of the ''Le Sacre'' would be as important as the 1902 premiere of Debussy's ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]''.<ref>Orenstein, p. 66</ref> After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March, Monteux drew the composer's attention to several passages which were causing problems: inaudible horns, a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings, and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during [[fortissimo]] episodes.<ref name=VDT36>Van den Toorn, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Stravinsky amended these passages, and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the \"Sacrificial Dance\". Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere; rather, Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more. According to Van den Toorn, \"[n]o other work of Stravinsky's underwent such a series of post-premiere revisions\".<ref name=VdT39>Van den Toorn, pp. 39\u201342</ref>\n\nStravinsky acknowledged that the work's opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs,<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 502</ref> but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources;<ref name=VdT10>Van den Toorn, p. 10</ref> if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music, he said, it was due to \"some unconscious 'folk' memory\".<ref name=VdT12>Van den Toorn, p. 12</ref> However, Morton has identified several more melodies in Part I as having their origins in the Lithuanian collection.<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 510</ref><ref name=Hvii>Hill, pp. vii\u2013viii</ref> More recently [[Richard Taruskin]] has discovered in the score an adapted tune from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's \"One Hundred Russian National Songs\".<ref name=VdT12 /><ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 513</ref> Taruskin notes the paradox whereby ''The Rite'', generally acknowledged as the most revolutionary of the composer's early works, is in fact rooted in the traditions of Russian music.<ref>Taruskin 1980, p. 543</ref>\n\n=== Realisation ===\n[[File:Vaslav-nijinsky-in-le-pavillon-d-armide-1911.jpg|thumb|upright|Nijinsky in 1911, depicted by [[John Singer Sargent]] in costume for his role in [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]]'s ballet ''Le Pavillon d'Armide'']]\nTaruskin has listed a number of sources that Roerich consulted when creating his designs. Among these are the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a 12th-century compendium of early pagan customs, and [[Alexander Afanasyev]]'s study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory.<ref name=Vdt14>Van den Toorn, pp. 14\u201315</ref> The Princess Tenisheva's collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration.<ref name=H4 /> When the designs were complete, Stravinsky expressed delight and declared them \"a real miracle\".<ref name=Vdt14 />\n\nStravinsky's relationship with his other main collaborator, Nijinsky, was more complicated. Diaghilev had decided that\nNijinsky's genius as a dancer would translate into the role of ballet-master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune]]'', caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work's end.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 36</ref><ref>Kelly, p. 263</ref> It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's \"passionate zeal and complete self-effacement\".<ref name=H109>Hill, p. 109</ref> However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: \"...&nbsp;the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument\".<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 40\u201341</ref>{{refn|group=n|Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska later insisted that her brother could play a number of instruments, including the [[balalaika]], the clarinet and the piano.<ref name=K273 />}} Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as \"knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas\".<ref name=\"Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143\"/>\n\nStravinsky's autobiographical account refers to many \"painful incidents\" between the ballet-master and the dancers during the rehearsal period.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 42</ref> By the beginning of 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that \"unless you come here immediately&nbsp;... the Sacre will not take place\". The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913, the dancers appeared to have mastered the work's difficulties. Even the Ballets Russes's sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky's choreography.<ref>Gregoriev, p. 84</ref>\n\nThe conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of ''Petrushka''. Monteux's first reaction to ''The Rite'', after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner. He drew Diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that; Diaghilev managed to change his mind.<ref name=reid>Charles Reid, ''Thomas Beecham: An Independent Biography'', 1961, p. 145</ref> Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism, he never came to enjoy the work; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it.<ref>Kelly, pp. 273\u201374</ref> In old age he said to Sir Thomas Beecham's biographer Charles Reid: \"I did not like ''Le Sacre'' then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

The theatre's manager, [[Gabriel Astruc]], was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year.<ref>Kelly p. 276</ref> The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, included ''Les Sylphides'', [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'' and Borodin's ''Polovtsian Dances''.<ref name=K284>Kelly, pp. 284\u201385</ref> Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs.<ref>Kelly, p. 305, 315 Gustave Linor, Comoedia 30 May 1913, reported 38,000, while a later review in ''Comoedia'' on 5 June reported 35,000</ref> A dress rehearsal was held in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky, all went peacefully.<ref name=S46 /> However, the critic of ''[[L'\u00c9cho de Paris]]'', [[Adolphe Boschot]], foresaw possible trouble; he wondered how the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.<ref name=K282>Kelly, p. 282</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 29 May, Gustav Linor reported, \"Never&nbsp;... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear\".<ref>Kelly, p. 304, quoting Gustav Linor writing in ''Comoedia'', 30 May 1913, ''At the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es: Le Sacre du printemps''</ref> The evening began with ''Les Sylphides'', in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles.<ref name=K284 /> ''The Rite'' followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew noisier when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in \"Augurs of Spring\". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, \"it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking.

Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected\u2014possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \"Sacrificial Dance\" was watched in reasonable silence.

When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married, and dismissed Nijinsky. Diaghilev was then obliged to re-hire Fokine, who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph ''Faune''. Fokine made it a condition of his re-employment that none of Nijinsky's choreography would be performed.<ref>Buckle, p. 268</ref> In a letter to the art critic and historian [[Alexandre Benois]], Stravinsky wrote, \"[T]he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance and, still more important, of again seeing this offspring of mine\".<ref>Walsh p. 219, quoting letter to Benois of 20 Sept/3 Oct 1913</ref>\n\nWith the disruption following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and the dispersal of many artistes, Diaghilev was ready to re-engage Nijinsky as both dancer and choreographer, but Nijinsky had been placed under house arrest in Hungary as an enemy Russian citizen. Diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in the United States, but the dancer's mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Acocella|first=Joan|title=Secrets of Nijinsky|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/01/14/secrets-of-nijinsky/|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=14 January 1999}}</ref> In 1920, when Diaghilev decided to revive ''The Rite'', he found that no one now remembered the choreography.<ref>Buckle, p. 366</ref> After spending most of the war years in Switzerland, and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Stravinsky resumed his partnership with Diaghilev when the war ended.

The transition into the \"Mystic Circles\" is almost imperceptible; the main theme of the section has been prefigured in the Introduction. A loud repeated chord, which Berger likens to a call to order, announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim. The \"Glorification of the Chosen One\" is brief and violent; in the \"Evocation of the Ancestors\" that follows, short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls.

This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I, though it contains some wild moments, with the large percussion section of the orchestra given full voice. Stravinsky had difficulties with this section, especially with the final bars that conclude the work. The abrupt ending displeased several critics, one of whom wrote that the music \"suddenly falls over on its side\". Stravinsky himself referred to the final chord disparagingly as \"a noise\", but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite the section, was unable to produce a more acceptable solution.<ref name=H86 />\n\n== Influence and adaptations ==\nThe music historian [[Donald Jay Grout]] has written: \"''The Sacre'' is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century&nbsp;... it had the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before\".<ref name=\"Grout and Palisca, p. 713\" /> The academic and critic Jan Smaczny, echoing Bernstein, calls it one of the 20th century's most influential compositions, providing \"endless stimulation for performers and listeners\".<ref name=Bernstein /><ref name= Smac>{{cite video\n | people = Smaczny, Jan (liner notes) | title = ''Stravinsky'': The Rite of Spring.

Among those impressed by the film was [[Gunther Schuller]], later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The ''Rite of Spring'' sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: \"I hope [Stravinsky] appreciated that hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of musicians were turned onto ''The Rite of Spring''&nbsp;... through ''Fantasia'', musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Teachout|first= Terry|title= Why 'Fantasia' Mattered\u2014Just Ask Gunther Schuller|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204644504576653263235079674?mod=googlenews_wsj%3Cbr%20/%3E|journal= Wall Street Journal|date= 28 October 2011}}</ref> In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer [[Paul Hindemith]] observed that \"Igor appears to love it\".<ref>Ross, pp. 297\u201398</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n{{Main|The Rite of Spring discography}}\nBefore the first gramophone disc recordings of ''The Rite'' were issued in 1929, Stravinsky had helped to produce a [[pianola]] version of the work for the London branch of the [[Aeolian Company]].<ref>Catalogue of Music for the 'Pianola' & 'Pianola' Piano, The Aeolian Company Ltd, London, July 1924, p. 88.</ref> He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the Pleyela, manufactured by the French piano company [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]], with whom he signed two contracts in April and May 1921, under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium.<ref>White 1979, pp. 619\u201320</ref><ref>Original contracts at the Paul Sacher-Stiftung, Basel, microfilm nos. 390018 to 390021.</ref> The Pleyela version of ''The Rite of Spring'' was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson first recorded the work in this form in 1990.<ref name=H162>Hill, pp. 162\u201364</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first orchestral gramophone recording of ''The Rite''.

Stravinsky thought that [[Pierre Boulez]], with the [[Orchestre National de France]] (1963), was \"less good than I had hoped&nbsp;... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations\". He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra for making the music sound Russian, \"which is just right\", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving.<ref>Stravinsky and Craft 1982, pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\nAs of 2013 there were well over 100 different recordings of ''The Rite'' commercially available, and many more held in library sound archives.

Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).<ref name=VdT39 /><ref name=Craft />\n\nIn 1922 Ansermet, who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin, sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score.<ref name=Craft /> In 1926, as part of his preparation for that year's performance with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], Stravinsky rewrote the \"Evocation of the Ancestors\" section and made substantial changes to the \"Sacrificial Dance\". The extent of these revisions, together with Ansermet's recommendations, convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary, and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929. It did not, however, incorporate all of Ansermet's amendments and, confusingly, bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition, making the new edition hard to identify.<ref name=VdT39 />\n\nStravinsky continued to revise the work, and in 1943 rewrote the \"Sacrificial Dance\".

The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America, where it had lapsed, but Boosey (who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue) did not have the rights to the revised finale.<ref>Walsh, pp. 151\u201352</ref>\n\nThe 1929 score as revised in 1948 forms the basis of most modern performances of ''The Rite.'' Boosey & Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B&H 19441) in 1967.

It was written for the 1913 Paris season of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] company; the original choreography was by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] with stage designs and costumes by [[Nicholas Roerich]]. When first performed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913, the [[avant-garde]] nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a \"riot\" or \"near-riot,\" though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shaver-Gleason |first1=Linda |title=Did Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring Incite a Riot at Its Premiere? |url=https://notanothermusichistorycliche.blogspot.com/2018/06/did-stravinskys-rite-of-spring-incite.html |website=Not Another Music History Clich\u00e9! |accessdate=7 December 2018 |date=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Levitz |first1=Tamara |title=\"Racism at the Rite,\" in The Rite of Spring at 100 |date=2013 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253024442 |pages=146\u201378}}</ref> Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\n\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. ''The Rite'' was the third such project, after the acclaimed ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]'' (1910) and ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911). The concept behind ''The Rite of Spring'', developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, \"Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts\"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kNMlDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=rite%20of%20spring&f=false|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|date=15 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226224848|language=en}}</ref> Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading ballet-masters, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the [[Joffrey Ballet]] in Los Angeles.\n\nStravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in [[tonality]], [[metre (music)|metre]], rhythm, [[Accent (music)|stress]] and [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in [[Russian traditional music|Russian folk music]], a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. The music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Igor Stravinsky as drawn by Pablo Picasso 31 Dec 1920 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stravinsky, sketched by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], 1920]]\n[[Igor Stravinsky]] was the son of [[Fyodor Stravinsky]], the principal [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the [[Mariinsky Theatre|Imperial Opera]], [[St Petersburg]], and Anna, n\u00e9e Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;1: Background and early years, 1882\u20131905|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg1#S52818.1|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]] while taking private lessons in harmony and [[counterpoint]]. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908, Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a [[Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor (Stravinsky)|Piano Sonata in F{{music|sharp}} minor]] (1903\u201304), a [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E{{music|flat}} major]] (1907), which he catalogued as \"Opus 1\", and a short orchestral piece, ''[[Feu d'artifice]]'' (\"Fireworks\", composed in 1908).<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;2: Towards ''The Firebird'', 1902\u201309 | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg2#S52818.2|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;11: Posthumous reputation and legacy: Works | url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article_works/grove/music/52818pg11#S52818.12|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909 ''Feu d'artifice'' was performed at a concert in St. Petersburg.

To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer [[Michel Fokine]], the designer [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] and the dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent.<ref>{{cite web|last= Griffiths|first= Paul|title= Diaghilev (Dyagilev), Sergey Pavlovich|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08450?q=Diaghilev&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> Having heard ''Feu d'artifice'' he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] to create the ballet ''[[Les Sylphides]]''. Stravinsky worked on the opening \"Nocturne\" and the closing \"Valse Brillante\"; his reward was a much bigger commission, to write the music for a new ballet, ''[[The Firebird]]'' (''L'oiseau de feu'') for the 1910 season.<ref name=Hartog52 />\n\nStravinsky worked through the winter of 1909\u201310, in close association with Fokine who was choreographing ''The Firebird''. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, \"the very essence of a great personality\".<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 24\u201328</ref> ''The Firebird'' was premiered on 25 June 1910, with [[Tamara Karsavina]] in the main role, and was a great public success.<ref>{{cite web|last= Walsh|first= Stephen|title= Stravinsky, Igor, \u00a7&nbsp;3: The early Diaghilev ballets, 1910\u201314|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52818pg3#S52818.3|publisher= Grove Music Online|year= 2012|accessdate= 9 August 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> This ensured that the Diaghilev\u2013Stravinsky collaboration would continue, in the first instance with ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and then ''The Rite of Spring''.<ref name=Hartog52 />\n\n== Synopsis and structure ==\nIn a note to the conductor [[Serge Koussevitzky]] in February 1914, Stravinsky described ''The Rite of Spring'' as \"a musical-choreographic work, [representing] pagan Russia&nbsp;... unified by a single idea: the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring\".

I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\".<ref>Stravinsky, p. 31</ref>\n\nBy May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with [[Nicholas Roerich]], the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the ''Polovtsian Dances''.<ref name=H4 /> The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \"The Great Sacrifice\" (Russian: ''Velikaia zhertva'');<ref name=VdT2>Van den Toorn, p. 2</ref> Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet ''Petrushka''.<ref name=H4>Hill, pp. 4\u20138</ref>\n\nIn July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near [[Smolensk]], where Roerich was staying with the [[Princess Maria Tenisheva]], a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]]''. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 35\u201336</ref> [[Thomas Forrest Kelly|Thomas F. Kelly]], in his history of the ''Rite'' premiere, suggests that the two-part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich.<ref>Kelly, p. 297</ref> Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the ''Russian Musical Gazette'', that the first part of the work would be called \"The Kiss of the Earth\", and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of [[Wise old man|sages]], culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, \"The Sacrifice\", would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages.<ref name=H4 /> The original working title was changed to \"Holy Spring\" (Russian: '' Vesna sviashchennaia''), but the work became generally known by the French translation ''Le Sacre du printemps'', or its English equivalent ''The Rite of Spring'', with the subtitle \"Pictures of Pagan Russia\".<ref name=VdT2 /><ref name=\"Grout and Palisca, p. 713\">Grout and Palisca, p. 713</ref>\n\n=== Composition ===\n[[File:RoyLindmanClarensSwitzerland 005.jpg|thumb|right|Clarens, in Switzerland (modern photograph), where most of ''The Rite of Spring'' was composed]]\nStravinsky's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at [[Ustyluh|Ustilug]] in Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the \"Augurs of Spring\" and the \"Spring Rounds\".<ref name=VdT24>Van den Toorn, p. 24</ref> In October he left Ustilug for [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]] in Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room\u2014an {{convert|8|by|8|ft|m|adj=on}} closet, with only a muted upright piano, a table and two chairs<ref name=\"Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143\">Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143</ref>\u2014he worked throughout the 1911\u201312 winter on the score.<ref name=H13>Hill, p. 13</ref> By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II.<ref name=VdT24 /> He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost,<ref name=H13 /> which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes conductor [[Pierre Monteux]] in April 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 35</ref> He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of ''The Rite''; he and the composer [[Claude Debussy]] played the first half of this together, in June 1912.<ref name=H13 />\n\nFollowing Diaghilev's decision to delay the premiere until 1913, Stravinsky put '' The Rite'' aside during the summer of 1912.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 34</ref> He enjoyed the Paris season, and accompanied Diaghilev to the [[Bayreuth Festival]] to attend a performance of ''[[Parsifal]]''.<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 37\u201339</ref> Stravinsky resumed work on ''The Rite'' in the autumn; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912.<ref name=VdT24 /> During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score, which he signed and dated as \"completed in Clarens, March 8, 1913\".<ref name=VDT36 /> He showed the manuscript to [[Maurice Ravel]], who was enthusiastic and predicted, in a letter to a friend, that the first performance of the ''Le Sacre'' would be as important as the 1902 premiere of Debussy's ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]''.<ref>Orenstein, p. 66</ref> After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March, Monteux drew the composer's attention to several passages which were causing problems: inaudible horns, a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings, and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during [[fortissimo]] episodes.<ref name=VDT36>Van den Toorn, pp. 36\u201338</ref> Stravinsky amended these passages, and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the \"Sacrificial Dance\". Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere; rather, Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more.

Diaghilev had decided that\nNijinsky's genius as a dancer would translate into the role of ballet-master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune]]'', caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work's end.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 36</ref><ref>Kelly, p. 263</ref> It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's \"passionate zeal and complete self-effacement\".<ref name=H109>Hill, p. 109</ref> However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: \"...&nbsp;the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument\".<ref>Stravinsky, pp. 40\u201341</ref>{{refn|group=n|Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska later insisted that her brother could play a number of instruments, including the [[balalaika]], the clarinet and the piano.<ref name=K273 />}} Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as \"knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas\".<ref name=\"Stravinsky and Craft 1981, p. 143\"/>\n\nStravinsky's autobiographical account refers to many \"painful incidents\" between the ballet-master and the dancers during the rehearsal period.<ref>Stravinsky, p. 42</ref> By the beginning of 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that \"unless you come here immediately&nbsp;... the Sacre will not take place\". The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913, the dancers appeared to have mastered the work's difficulties. Even the Ballets Russes's sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky's choreography.<ref>Gregoriev, p. 84</ref>\n\nThe conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of ''Petrushka''. Monteux's first reaction to ''The Rite'', after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner.

Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected\u2014possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \"Sacrificial Dance\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.<ref name=K292>Kelly, pp. 292\u201394</ref>\n\nAmong the more hostile press reviews was that of ''[[Le Figaro]]''{{'}}s critic, [[Henri Quittard]], who called the work \"a laborious and puerile barbarity\" and added \"We are sorry to see an artist such as M.

This is written as a more disciplined ritual than the extravagant dance that ended Part I, though it contains some wild moments, with the large percussion section of the orchestra given full voice. Stravinsky had difficulties with this section, especially with the final bars that conclude the work. The abrupt ending displeased several critics, one of whom wrote that the music \"suddenly falls over on its side\". Stravinsky himself referred to the final chord disparagingly as \"a noise\", but in his various attempts to amend or rewrite the section, was unable to produce a more acceptable solution.<ref name=H86 />\n\n== Influence and adaptations ==\nThe music historian [[Donald Jay Grout]] has written: \"''The Sacre'' is undoubtedly the most famous composition of the early 20th century&nbsp;... it had the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before\".<ref name=\"Grout and Palisca, p. 713\" /> The academic and critic Jan Smaczny, echoing Bernstein, calls it one of the 20th century's most influential compositions, providing \"endless stimulation for performers and listeners\".<ref name=Bernstein /><ref name= Smac>{{cite video\n | people = Smaczny, Jan (liner notes) | title = ''Stravinsky'': The Rite of Spring.

Var\u00e8se, according to Ross, was particularly drawn to the \"cruel harmonies and stimulating rhythms\" of ''The Rite'', which he employed to full effect in his concert work ''[[Am\u00e9riques]]'' (1921), scored for a massive orchestra with added sound effects including a lion's roar and a wailing siren.<ref>Ross, p. 137</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= May|first= Thomas|title= Var\u00e8se: Am\u00e9riques|url= http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/ameriques-edgard-varese|publisher= The Los Angeles Philharmonic|accessdate= 19 August 2012|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121202075517/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/ameriques-edgard-varese|archivedate= 2 December 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> [[Aaron Copland]], to whom Stravinsky was a particular inspiration in the former's student days, considered ''The Rite'' a masterpiece that had created \"the decade of the displaced accent and the polytonal chord\".<ref>{{cite video\n | people = Gammond, Peter (liner notes)\n | title = ''Stravinsky'': The Rite of Spring.

Coincidentally, it was in that year that [[Walt Disney]] released ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', an animated feature film using music from ''The Rite'' and other classical compositions, conducted by Stokowski.<ref name=K258 /> The ''Rite'' segment of the film depicted the Earth's prehistory, with the creation of life, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs as the finale. Among those impressed by the film was [[Gunther Schuller]], later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The ''Rite of Spring'' sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: \"I hope [Stravinsky] appreciated that hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of musicians were turned onto ''The Rite of Spring''&nbsp;... through ''Fantasia'', musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, or at least not until many years later\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Teachout|first= Terry|title= Why 'Fantasia' Mattered\u2014Just Ask Gunther Schuller|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204644504576653263235079674?mod=googlenews_wsj%3Cbr%20/%3E|journal= Wall Street Journal|date= 28 October 2011}}</ref> In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer [[Paul Hindemith]] observed that \"Igor appears to love it\".<ref>Ross, pp. 297\u201398</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n{{Main|The Rite of Spring discography}}\nBefore the first gramophone disc recordings of ''The Rite'' were issued in 1929, Stravinsky had helped to produce a [[pianola]] version of the work for the London branch of the [[Aeolian Company]].<ref>Catalogue of Music for the 'Pianola' & 'Pianola' Piano, The Aeolian Company Ltd, London, July 1924, p. 88.</ref> He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the Pleyela, manufactured by the French piano company [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]], with whom he signed two contracts in April and May 1921, under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium.<ref>White 1979, pp. 619\u201320</ref><ref>Original contracts at the Paul Sacher-Stiftung, Basel, microfilm nos. 390018 to 390021.</ref> The Pleyela version of ''The Rite of Spring'' was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson first recorded the work in this form in 1990.<ref name=H162>Hill, pp. 162\u201364</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Stravinsky and Monteux vied with each other to conduct the first orchestral gramophone recording of ''The Rite''. While Stravinsky led [[Walther Straram|L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram]] in a recording for the Columbia label, at the same time Monteux was recording it for the HMV label. Stokowski's version followed in 1930. Stravinsky made two more recordings, in 1940 and 1960.<ref name=H162 /><ref>Hill, pp. 118\u201319</ref> According to the critic [[Edward Greenfield]], Stravinsky was not technically a great conductor but, Greenfield says, in the 1960 recording with the [[Columbia Symphony Orchestra]] the composer inspired a performance with \"extraordinary thrust and resilience\".<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Edward Greenfield|last= Greenfield|first= Edward|title= Distinctive movements in the rites of rivals|journal= The Guardian|date= 20 May 1988|page=34}}</ref> In conversations with [[Robert Craft]], Stravinsky reviewed several recordings of ''The Rite'' made in the 1960s. He thought [[Herbert von Karajan]]'s 1963 recording with the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]], was good, but \"the performance is&nbsp;... too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one\". Stravinsky thought that [[Pierre Boulez]], with the [[Orchestre National de France]] (1963), was \"less good than I had hoped&nbsp;... very bad tempi and some tasteless alterations\". He praised a 1962 recording by The Moscow State Symphony Orchestra for making the music sound Russian, \"which is just right\", but Stravinsky's concluding judgement was that none of these three performances was worth preserving.<ref>Stravinsky and Craft 1982, pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\nAs of 2013 there were well over 100 different recordings of ''The Rite'' commercially available, and many more held in library sound archives. It has become one of the most recorded of all 20th century musical works.<ref name=H162 /><ref>{{cite web|title= Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring (Le Sacre du Printemps)|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/53903/Igor-Feodorovich-Stravinsky-The-Rite-of-Spring|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Editions ==\nThe first published score was the four-hand piano arrangement ([[Editions Russes#Names of imprints|Edition Russe de Musique]], RV196), dated 1913. Publication of the full orchestral score was prevented by the outbreak of war in August 1914. After the revival of the work in 1920 Stravinsky, who had not heard the music for seven years, made numerous revisions to the score, which was finally published in 1921 (Edition Russe de Musique, RV 197/197b. large and pocket scores).<ref name=VdT39 /><ref name=Craft />\n\nIn 1922 Ansermet, who was preparing to perform the work in Berlin, sent to Stravinsky a list of errors he had found in the published score.<ref name=Craft /> In 1926, as part of his preparation for that year's performance with the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]], Stravinsky rewrote the \"Evocation of the Ancestors\" section and made substantial changes to the \"Sacrificial Dance\". The extent of these revisions, together with Ansermet's recommendations, convinced Stravinsky that a new edition was necessary, and this appeared in large and pocket form in 1929. It did not, however, incorporate all of Ansermet's amendments and, confusingly, bore the date and RV code of the 1921 edition, making the new edition hard to identify.<ref name=VdT39 />\n\nStravinsky continued to revise the work, and in 1943 rewrote the \"Sacrificial Dance\". In 1948 [[Boosey & Hawkes]] issued a corrected version of the 1929 score (B&H 16333), although Stravinsky's substantial 1943 amendment of the \"Sacrificial Dance\" was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed, to the composer's disappointment. He considered it \"much easier to play&nbsp;... and superior in balance and sonority\" to the earlier versions.<ref name=Craft>{{cite journal|authorlink= Robert Craft|last= Craft|first= Robert|title=''Le Sacre du Printemps'': The Revisions|journal= Tempo|volume= New Series|issue= 122|date= September 1977|pages= 2\u20138|doi= 10.1017/S004029820002934X|jstor= 945096}} {{subscription}}</ref> A less musical motive for the revisions and corrected editions was copyright law. The composer had left Galaxy Music Corporation (agents for Editions Russe de la Musique, the original publisher) for Associated Music Publishers at the time, and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second rental charge from two publishers to match the full work and the revised Sacrificial Dance; moreover, the revised dance could only be published in America. The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America, where it had lapsed, but Boosey (who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue) did not have the rights to the revised finale.<ref>Walsh, pp. 151\u201352</ref>\n\nThe 1929 score as revised in 1948 forms the basis of most modern performances of ''The Rite.'' Boosey & Hawkes reissued their 1948 edition in 1965, and produced a newly engraved edition (B&H 19441) in 1967. The firm also issued an unmodified reprint of the 1913 piano reduction in 1952 (B&H 17271) and a revised piano version, incorporating the 1929 revisions, in 1967.<ref name=VdT39 />\n\nThe [[Paul Sacher Foundation]], in association with Boosey & Hawkes, announced in May 2013, as part of ''The Rite''{{'}}s centenary celebrations, their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score, as used in early performances. After being kept in Russia for decades, the autograph score was acquired by Boosey & Hawkes in 1947. The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962, on his 80th birthday. After the composer's death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the Paul Sacher Foundation. As well as the autograph score, they have published the manuscript piano four-hands score.<ref>Van den Toorn, p. 36 (note 30)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/news/Stravinsky-Rite-of-Spring-centenary-publications-announced/100069 |title=Stravinsky: Rite of Spring centenary publications announced |publisher=[[Boosey & Hawkes]]|accessdate=3 April 2013 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407111544/http://www.boosey.com/cr/news/Stravinsky-Rite-of-Spring-centenary-publications-announced/100069 |archivedate=7 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[Edwin F.

He was a central figure of 20th-century British classical music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' (1945), the ''[[War Requiem]]'' (1962) and the orchestral showpiece ''[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]]'' (1945).\n\nBorn in [[Lowestoft]], [[Suffolk]], the son of a dentist, Britten showed talent from an early age. He studied at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London and privately with the composer [[Frank Bridge]]. Britten first came to public attention with the ''[[a cappella]]'' choral work ''[[A Boy was Born]]'' in 1934. With the premiere of ''Peter Grimes'' in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for [[English National Opera|Sadler's Wells]] and [[The Royal Opera|Covent Garden]], he wrote \"chamber operas\" for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence.\n\nBritten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', a ''[[Missa Brevis (Britten)|Missa Brevis]]'', and the song collection ''[[Friday Afternoons]]''. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the [[tenor voice|tenor]] [[Peter Pears]]; others included [[Kathleen Ferrier]], [[Jennifer Vyvyan]], [[Janet Baker]], [[Dennis Brain]], [[Julian Bream]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Brandenburg Concertos]]'', [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] symphonies, and song cycles by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]].\n\nTogether with Pears and the librettist and producer [[Eric Crozier]], Britten founded the annual [[Aldeburgh Festival]] in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of [[Snape Maltings]] concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a [[life peer]]age.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Birthplace of Benjamin Britten.JPG|thumb|Britten's birthplace in Lowestoft, which was the Britten family home for over twenty years]]\nBritten was born in the fishing port of [[Lowestoft]] in [[Suffolk]], on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913,<ref>Matthews, p. 1</ref> the feast day of [[Saint Cecilia]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 2</ref> He was the youngest of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878\u20131934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, ''n\u00e9e'' Hockey (1874\u20131937).{{refn|Britten's siblings were (Edith) Barbara (1902\u201382), Robert Harry Marsh (\"Bobby\", 1907\u201387), and (Charlotte) Elizabeth (\"Beth\", 1909\u201389).<ref>Evans (2009), p. 513</ref>|group= n}} Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a [[civil service]] clerk in the British Government's [[Home Office]]. They were married in September 1901 at [[St John's, Smith Square]], London.<ref>Powell, p. 3</ref>\n\nThe consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 4 and 7; Kildea, p. 4; Matthews, p. 2; and Powell pp. 10\u201311</ref> Britten, according to his sister Beth, \"got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains\".<ref>Blyth, p. 36</ref> Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society.<ref>Kildea, p. 4; and Matthews, p. 3</ref> In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as \"very ordinary middle class\", but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith's father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family's social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soir\u00e9es at the house.<ref name=p7>Powell, p. 7</ref>\n\nWhen Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died.<ref>Matthews, p. 3</ref> The illness left him with a damaged heart,<ref>Carpenter, p. 6</ref> and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life.<ref>Blyth, p. 25</ref> He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer.<ref>Blyth, p. 25; and Powell, p. 16</ref> To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in [[ragtime]].<ref>Carpenter, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five.<ref>White, p. 2</ref> He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the [[viola]].<ref>Carpenter pp. 8 and 13</ref> He was one of the last composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.<ref name=p7/>\n\n===Education===\n\n====Lowestoft====\nWhen he was seven Britten was sent to a [[dame school]], run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching.<ref>Powell, p. 5</ref> The following year he moved on to his [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]], [[Old Buckenham Hall|South Lodge]], Lowestoft, as a [[Day pupil|day boy]].<ref>Carpenter, pp. 8\u20139</ref> The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong [[pacifism]] probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school.<ref>Carpenter, p. 10</ref> He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of his mother, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage.<ref>Carpenter, p. 13</ref> In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his ''[[Simple Symphony]]'', based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note:\n{{quote|Once upon a time there was a prep-school boy.&nbsp;... He was quite an ordinary little boy&nbsp;... he loved cricket, only quite liked football (although he kicked a pretty \"corner\"); he adored mathematics, got on all right with history, was scared by Latin Unseen; he behaved fairly well, only ragged the recognised amount, so that his contacts with the cane or the slipper were happily rare (although one nocturnal expedition to stalk ghosts left its marks behind); he worked his way up the school slowly and steadily, until at the age of thirteen he reached that pinnacle of importance and grandeur, never to be quite equalled in later days: the head of the Sixth, head-prefect, and [[Victor Ludorum]]. But \u2013 there was one curious thing about this boy: he wrote music. His friends bore with it, his enemies kicked a bit but not for long (he was quite tough), the staff couldn't object if his work and games didn't suffer. He wrote lots of it, reams and reams of it.<ref>Britten, Benjamin.

At one of these, during the triennial [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] in October 1924, he heard [[Frank Bridge]]'s orchestral poem ''[[The Sea (Bridge)|The Sea]]'', conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, \"knocked sideways\" by it.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 13\u201314</ref><ref name=modern>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2e7SMzssGAC&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=frank+bridge+%22the+sea%22&source=bl&ots=lbrV3etYyd&sig=CrTj05hnihsJDPthqAp0Vck_oRk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OQUlUoicNuH6iQfT8oGQBA&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBjgo#v=onepage&q=frank%20bridge%20%22the%20sea%22&f=false Lara Feigel, Alexandra Harris eds, ''Modernism on Sea: Art and Culture at the British Seaside'']; accessed 3 September 2013</ref> Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him.<ref name= M8>Matthews, p. 8</ref> Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague [[Harold Samuel]].<ref>Carpenter, p. 16</ref>\n\nBridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing{{refn|Britten later gave an example of the detailed skill instilled in him by Bridge: \"I came up with a series of [[major seventh]]s on the violin. Bridge was against this, saying that the instrument didn't vibrate properly with this interval: it should be divided between two instruments\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Carpenter, p. 17</ref>|group= n}} and the maxim that \"you should find yourself and be true to what you found.\"<ref name=dnb>Mitchell (2004)</ref> The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the ''Quatre Chansons Fran\u00e7aises'', a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and [[Michael Oliver (writer, broadcaster)|Michael Oliver]] judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught;<ref>Carpenter, p. 18 and Oliver, p. 23</ref> [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.<ref name=dnb />\n\n====Public school and Royal College of Music====\n[[File:Mahler-Ireland-Stravinsky-Shostakovich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Early influences, clockwise from top left: [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[John Ireland (composer)|Ireland]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]]]\nIn September 1928 Britten went as a [[Boarding school|boarder]] to [[Gresham's School, Holt|Gresham's School]], in [[Holt, Norfolk]]. At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away:<ref>Bridcut (2006): p. 16</ref> he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it.<ref>Matthews, p. 11</ref>{{refn|When it came to leaving Gresham's, Britten found it a wrench, confessing: \"I am terribly sorry to leave such boys as these.

He won the [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] Prize for composition, the [[Walter Willson Cobbett|Cobbett]] Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the [[Ernest Farrar]] Prize for composition.<ref>Craggs, p. 4</ref> Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students \"amateurish and folksy\" and the staff \"inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere\".<ref>Carpenter, p. 35</ref>{{refn|This academic mistrust of Britten's technical skills persisted. In 1994 the critic Derrick Puffett wrote that in the 1960s Britten was still regarded with suspicion on account of his technical expertise; Puffett quoted remarks by the Professor of Music at Oxford in the 1960s, [[Jack Westrup|Sir Jack Westrup]], to the effect that Britten was to be distrusted for his \"superficial effects\", whereas Tippett was considered \"awkward and technically unskilled but somehow authentic.\"<ref>Puffett, Derrick.

Either he couldn't score at all, or he could only score like Wagner, using enormous orchestras with so much going on that you couldn't hear anything clearly. Above all, he was not original. In other words, nothing for a young student!\" Britten judged, on the contrary, \"His influence on contemporary writing&nbsp;... could only be beneficial. His style is free from excessive personal mannerisms, and his scores are models of how the modern virtuoso orchestra should be used, nothing being left to chance and every note sounding.\"<ref name=mahler>Britten, Benjamin.

Auden was, as [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]] puts it, \"cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous\"; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.<ref>Matthews, p, 34</ref>\n\nIn the three years from 1935 to 1937 Britten wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio.<ref>White, Eric Walter.

Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, [[The Company of Heaven#History|a setting]] of [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s poem, \"A thousand gleaming fires\", for tenor and strings.<ref>Carpenter, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring 1937 Britten composed a ''Pacifist March'' to words by [[Ronald Duncan]] for the [[Peace Pledge Union]], of which, as a pacifist, he had become an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn.<ref>Matthews, p. 40</ref> The best known of his compositions from this period is probably ''[[Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge]]'' for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic.<ref>Matthews, p. 46</ref> It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including [[John Barbirolli]] and [[Serge Koussevitzky]].<ref name=press>Robinson (1997)</ref>\n\n===America 1939\u201342===\nIn April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend [[Christopher Isherwood]] to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances.<ref name=dnb/><ref name=grove>Doctor, LeGrove, Banks, Wiebe and Brett (2013)</ref> Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 87\u201388</ref> When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors.<ref name=press/> Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 91\u201392</ref>\n\nAlready a friend of the composer [[Aaron Copland]], Britten encountered his latest works ''[[Billy the Kid]]'' and ''An Outdoor Overture'', both of which influenced his own music.<ref>Evans (1979), p. 57</ref> In 1940 Britten composed ''Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo'', the first of many song cycles for Pears.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 98\u201399</ref> Britten's orchestral works from this period include the [[Violin Concerto (Britten)|Violin Concerto]] and ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]''. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, ''Paul Bunyan'', an [[operetta]], to a [[libretto]] by Auden.<ref name=grove/> While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with [[Balinese gamelan]] music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer [[Colin McPhee]].

Thomson described ''[[Les Illuminations (Britten)|Les Illuminations]]'' (1940) as \"little more than a series of bromidic and facile 'effects'&nbsp;... pretentious, banal and utterly disappointing\", and was equally unflattering about Pears's voice.

The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is \"as exciting as ''Les Illuminations'', and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.\"<ref name=mason1>Mason, Colin.

Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others.<ref name=mason1/>\n\nThe ''[[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]]'' (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as \"not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think\", it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with ''Peter Grimes'' it established him as one of the leading composers of his day.<ref name=dnb/> Mason calls it \"a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method.

At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's \"Strange meeting\" mingles with the ''[[In paradisum]]'' of the mass.

The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich\u00e9s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant [[fugue|fugal]] finale.<ref>Richards, Denby (1977).

In May 1944 he conducted the [[Boyd Neel]] string orchestra, [[Dennis Brain]] and Pears in the first recording of the ''Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings'', which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD.<ref name=decca/>\n\nBritten's first operatic recording was ''The Turn of the Screw'', made in January 1955 with the original English Opera Group forces. In 1957 he conducted ''The Prince of the Pagodas'' in an early stereo recording, supervised by Culshaw.<ref name=decca/> Decca's first major commercial success with Britten came the following year, with ''Peter Grimes'', which has, at 2013, never been out of the catalogues since its first release.<ref name=decca/> From 1958 Britten conducted Decca recordings of many of his operas and vocal and orchestral works, including the ''Nocturne'' (1959), the ''Spring Symphony'' (1960) and the ''War Requiem'' (1963).<ref name=decca/> The last sold in unexpectedly large numbers for a classical set, and thereafter Decca unstintingly made resources available to Culshaw and his successors for Britten recordings.<ref>Culshaw, p. 339</ref> Sets followed of ''Albert Herring'' (1964), the ''Sinfonia da Requiem'' (1964), ''Curlew River'' (1965), ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1966), ''The Burning Fiery Furnace'' (1967), ''Billy Budd'' (1967) and many of the other major works.<ref name=decca/> In 2013, to mark the anniversary of Britten's birth, Decca released a set of 65 CDs and one DVD, \"Benjamin Britten \u2013 Complete Works\".{{refn|The set comprises all the composer's works with opus numbers and all works commercially recorded by 2013 (many fragments and juvenilia have not been published or recorded).

He was a central figure of 20th-century British classical music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' (1945), the ''[[War Requiem]]'' (1962) and the orchestral showpiece ''[[The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra]]'' (1945).\n\nBorn in [[Lowestoft]], [[Suffolk]], the son of a dentist, Britten showed talent from an early age. He studied at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London and privately with the composer [[Frank Bridge]]. Britten first came to public attention with the ''[[a cappella]]'' choral work ''[[A Boy was Born]]'' in 1934. With the premiere of ''Peter Grimes'' in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for [[English National Opera|Sadler's Wells]] and [[The Royal Opera|Covent Garden]], he wrote \"chamber operas\" for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'' (1954). Recurring themes in his operas include the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society and the corruption of innocence.\n\nBritten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'', a ''[[Missa Brevis (Britten)|Missa Brevis]]'', and the song collection ''[[Friday Afternoons]]''. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the [[tenor voice|tenor]] [[Peter Pears]]; others included [[Kathleen Ferrier]], [[Jennifer Vyvyan]], [[Janet Baker]], [[Dennis Brain]], [[Julian Bream]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Brandenburg Concertos]]'', [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] symphonies, and song cycles by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]].\n\nTogether with Pears and the librettist and producer [[Eric Crozier]], Britten founded the annual [[Aldeburgh Festival]] in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of [[Snape Maltings]] concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a [[life peer]]age.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Birthplace of Benjamin Britten.JPG|thumb|Britten's birthplace in Lowestoft, which was the Britten family home for over twenty years]]\nBritten was born in the fishing port of [[Lowestoft]] in [[Suffolk]], on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913,<ref>Matthews, p. 1</ref> the feast day of [[Saint Cecilia]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 2</ref> He was the youngest of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878\u20131934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, ''n\u00e9e'' Hockey (1874\u20131937).{{refn|Britten's siblings were (Edith) Barbara (1902\u201382), Robert Harry Marsh (\"Bobby\", 1907\u201387), and (Charlotte) Elizabeth (\"Beth\", 1909\u201389).<ref>Evans (2009), p. 513</ref>|group= n}} Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a [[civil service]] clerk in the British Government's [[Home Office]]. They were married in September 1901 at [[St John's, Smith Square]], London.<ref>Powell, p. 3</ref>\n\nThe consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 4 and 7; Kildea, p. 4; Matthews, p. 2; and Powell pp. 10\u201311</ref> Britten, according to his sister Beth, \"got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains\".<ref>Blyth, p. 36</ref> Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society.<ref>Kildea, p. 4; and Matthews, p. 3</ref> In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as \"very ordinary middle class\", but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith's father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 4\u20135</ref> Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family's social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soir\u00e9es at the house.<ref name=p7>Powell, p. 7</ref>\n\nWhen Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died.<ref>Matthews, p. 3</ref> The illness left him with a damaged heart,<ref>Carpenter, p. 6</ref> and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life.<ref>Blyth, p. 25</ref> He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer.<ref>Blyth, p. 25; and Powell, p. 16</ref> To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in [[ragtime]].<ref>Carpenter, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five.<ref>White, p. 2</ref> He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the [[viola]].<ref>Carpenter pp. 8 and 13</ref> He was one of the last composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.<ref name=p7/>\n\n===Education===\n\n====Lowestoft====\nWhen he was seven Britten was sent to a [[dame school]], run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching.<ref>Powell, p. 5</ref> The following year he moved on to his [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]], [[Old Buckenham Hall|South Lodge]], Lowestoft, as a [[Day pupil|day boy]].<ref>Carpenter, pp. 8\u20139</ref> The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong [[pacifism]] probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school.<ref>Carpenter, p. 10</ref> He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of his mother, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage.<ref>Carpenter, p. 13</ref> In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his ''[[Simple Symphony]]'', based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note:\n{{quote|Once upon a time there was a prep-school boy.&nbsp;... He was quite an ordinary little boy&nbsp;... he loved cricket, only quite liked football (although he kicked a pretty \"corner\"); he adored mathematics, got on all right with history, was scared by Latin Unseen; he behaved fairly well, only ragged the recognised amount, so that his contacts with the cane or the slipper were happily rare (although one nocturnal expedition to stalk ghosts left its marks behind); he worked his way up the school slowly and steadily, until at the age of thirteen he reached that pinnacle of importance and grandeur, never to be quite equalled in later days: the head of the Sixth, head-prefect, and [[Victor Ludorum]]. But \u2013 there was one curious thing about this boy: he wrote music. His friends bore with it, his enemies kicked a bit but not for long (he was quite tough), the staff couldn't object if his work and games didn't suffer. He wrote lots of it, reams and reams of it.<ref>Britten, Benjamin.

At one of these, during the triennial [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] in October 1924,  he heard [[Frank Bridge]]'s orchestral poem ''[[The Sea (Bridge)|The Sea]]'', conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, \"knocked sideways\" by it.<ref>Carpenter, pp. 13\u201314</ref><ref name=modern>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2e7SMzssGAC&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=frank+bridge+%22the+sea%22&source=bl&ots=lbrV3etYyd&sig=CrTj05hnihsJDPthqAp0Vck_oRk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OQUlUoicNuH6iQfT8oGQBA&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBjgo#v=onepage&q=frank%20bridge%20%22the%20sea%22&f=false Lara Feigel, Alexandra Harris eds, ''Modernism on Sea: Art and Culture at the British Seaside'']; accessed 3 September 2013</ref> Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him.<ref name= M8>Matthews, p. 8</ref> Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague [[Harold Samuel]].<ref>Carpenter, p. 16</ref>\n\nBridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing{{refn|Britten later gave an example of the detailed skill instilled in him by Bridge: \"I came up with a series of [[major seventh]]s on the violin. Bridge was against this, saying that the instrument didn't vibrate properly with this interval: it should be divided between two instruments\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Carpenter, p. 17</ref>|group= n}} and the maxim that \"you should find yourself and be true to what you found.\"<ref name=dnb>Mitchell (2004)</ref> The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the ''Quatre Chansons Fran\u00e7aises'', a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and [[Michael Oliver (writer, broadcaster)|Michael Oliver]] judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught;<ref>Carpenter, p. 18 and Oliver, p. 23</ref> [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.<ref name=dnb />\n\n====Public school and Royal College of Music====\n[[File:Mahler-Ireland-Stravinsky-Shostakovich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Early influences, clockwise from top left: [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[John Ireland (composer)|Ireland]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]]]\nIn September 1928 Britten went as a [[Boarding school|boarder]] to [[Gresham's School, Holt|Gresham's School]], in [[Holt, Norfolk]]. At the time he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away:<ref>Bridcut (2006): p. 16</ref> he hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it.<ref>Matthews, p. 11</ref>{{refn|When it came to leaving Gresham's, Britten found it a wrench, confessing: \"I am terribly sorry to leave such boys as these.

He won the [[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]] Prize for composition, the [[Walter Willson Cobbett|Cobbett]] Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the [[Ernest Farrar]] Prize for composition.<ref>Craggs, p. 4</ref> Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students \"amateurish and folksy\" and the staff \"inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere\".<ref>Carpenter, p. 35</ref>{{refn|This academic mistrust of Britten's technical skills persisted. In 1994 the critic Derrick Puffett wrote that in the 1960s Britten was still regarded with suspicion on account of his technical expertise; Puffett quoted remarks by the Professor of Music at Oxford in the 1960s, [[Jack Westrup|Sir Jack Westrup]], to the effect that Britten was to be distrusted for his \"superficial effects\", whereas Tippett was considered \"awkward and technically unskilled but somehow authentic.\"<ref>Puffett, Derrick.

Either he couldn't score at all, or he could only score like Wagner, using enormous orchestras with so much going on that you couldn't hear anything clearly. Above all, he was not original. In other words, nothing for a young student!\" Britten judged, on the contrary, \"His influence on contemporary writing&nbsp;... could only be beneficial. His style is free from excessive personal mannerisms, and his scores are models of how the modern virtuoso orchestra should be used, nothing being left to chance and every note sounding.\"<ref name=mahler>Britten, Benjamin.

Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted to his mother and was devastated at her death, it also seems to have been something of a liberation for him.<ref>Powell, p. 127; and Matthews, p. 38</ref> Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger.<ref>Matthews, pp. 38\u201339</ref> Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash.<ref>Powell, p. 130</ref> Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, [[The Company of Heaven#History|a setting]] of [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s poem, \"A thousand gleaming fires\", for tenor and strings.<ref>Carpenter, p. 112</ref>\n\nDuring 1937 Britten composed a ''Pacifist March'' to words by [[Ronald Duncan]] for the [[Peace Pledge Union]], of which, as a pacifist, he had become an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn.<ref>Matthews, p. 40</ref> The best known of his compositions from this period is probably ''[[Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge]]'' for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic.<ref>Matthews, p. 46</ref> It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including [[John Barbirolli]] and [[Serge Koussevitzky]].<ref name=press>Robinson (1997)</ref>\n\n===America 1939\u201342===\nIn April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend [[Christopher Isherwood]] to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances.<ref name=dnb/><ref name=grove>Doctor, LeGrove, Banks, Wiebe and Brett (2013)</ref> Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 87\u201388</ref> When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors.<ref name=press/> Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 91\u201392</ref>\n\nAlready a friend of the composer [[Aaron Copland]], Britten encountered his latest works ''[[Billy the Kid]]'' and ''An Outdoor Overture'', both of which influenced his own music.<ref>Evans (1979), p. 57</ref> In 1940 Britten composed ''Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo'', the first of many song cycles for Pears.<ref>Headington (1993), pp. 98\u201399</ref> Britten's orchestral works from this period include the [[Violin Concerto (Britten)|Violin Concerto]] and ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]''. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, ''Paul Bunyan'', an [[operetta]], to a [[libretto]] by Auden.<ref name=grove/> While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with [[Balinese gamelan]] music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer [[Colin McPhee]]. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording.<ref>Kennedy, p. 31</ref> This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 213, 216 and 256</ref>\n\nMoving to the US did not relieve Britten of the nuisance of hostile criticism: although [[Olin Downes]], the doyen of New York music critics, and [[Irving Kolodin]] took to Britten's music, [[Virgil Thomson]] was, as the music scholar Suzanne Robinson puts it, consistently \"severe and spiteful\". Thomson described ''[[Les Illuminations (Britten)|Les Illuminations]]'' (1940) as \"little more than a series of bromidic and facile 'effects'&nbsp;... pretentious, banal and utterly disappointing\", and was equally unflattering about Pears's voice.

During the long transatlantic sea crossing Britten completed the choral works ''[[A Ceremony of Carols]]'' and ''Hymn to St Cecilia''. The latter was his last large-scale collaboration with Auden. Britten had grown away from him, and Auden became one of the composer's so-called \"corpses\" \u2013 former intimates from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him in some way.<ref>Matthews, p. 79</ref>\n\nHaving arrived in Britain, Britten and Pears applied for recognition as [[conscientious objector]]s; Britten was initially allowed only non-combatant service in the military, but on appeal he gained unconditional exemption.<ref>Matthews, p. 66</ref> After the death of his mother in 1937 he had used money she bequeathed him to buy the Old Mill in [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]], Suffolk which became his country home.

In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, ''Quatre chansons fran\u00e7aises'', setting words by [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, \"the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic\".<ref name=grove/> After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed ''Our Hunting Fathers'' (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is \"as exciting as ''Les Illuminations'', and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.\"<ref name=mason1>Mason, Colin.

Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others.<ref name=mason1/>\n\nThe ''[[Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings]]'' (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as \"not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think\", it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with ''Peter Grimes'' it established him as one of the leading composers of his day.<ref name=dnb/> Mason calls it \"a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method.

At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's \"Strange meeting\" mingles with the ''[[In paradisum]]'' of the mass.

The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich\u00e9s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant [[fugue|fugal]] finale.<ref>Richards, Denby (1977).

Howard]]. The picture's screenplay was Sturges' first script, which he delivered complete in the form of a finished shooting script, for which he received $17,500 (${{Inflation|US|17500|1933|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) and a percentage of the profits. Profit-sharing arrangements, now a common practice in Hollywood, were then unusual and gained Sturges much attention.<ref>American Masters [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/sturges_p.html Preston Sturges]</ref>\n\nThe film, told through flashbacks, was cited by [[Pauline Kael]] in her essay \"[[Raising Kane]]\", as a prototype for the narrative structure of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941). (Screenwriter [[Herman J.

W. Post|C.W. Post]], his second wife's grandfather, who founded the [[Postum Cereal Company]], which later became [[General Foods]]. Like Tom Garner, the lead character of the film, Post worked his way up from the bottom, and ended his own life. Otherwise, according to Sturges, their lives did not correspond.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nIn 2014, ''The Power and the Glory'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2014/14-210.html</ref>\n\nThe film is unrelated to the 1940 [[The Power and the Glory|novel]] of the same title by [[Graham Greene]].\n\n==Premise==\nAfter the funeral service for Tom Garner ([[Spencer Tracy]]), a powerful and much-hated railroad tycoon who committed suicide, his best friend Henry ([[Ralph Morgan]]) recalls Garner's life, his family problems, and his rise from track walker to president of the railroad.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Tom Garner\n* [[Colleen Moore]] as Sally Garner\n* [[Ralph Morgan]] as Henry\n* [[Helen Vinson]] as Eve Borden\n* [[Phillip Trent]] as Tom Garner, Jr. \n* [[Henry Kolker]] as Mr. Borden\n* [[J.

He told the story to producer [[Jesse L. Lasky]], who had his own unit at [[Fox Film]], and requested a [[film treatment|treatment]]. Sturges refused to do a treatment, and instead delivered a finished shooting script, which Lasky said was \"the most perfect script I'd ever seen\", with nothing that needed to be trimmed.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nSturges offered the script to Lasky for $62,475, but Lasky instead structured a deal in which Sturges got $17,500 upon signing, 3{{frac|1|2}}% of the first $500,000 in receipts, 5% of the next $500,000, and 7% of all receipts over $1,000,000.  Such a percentage deal was highly unusual at that time, and caused an uproar among producers and writers.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nBoth director  [[William K.

When this did not satisfy the censors, reshooting and more extensive re-editing was done to alleviate their concerns.

The film was a box office disappointment for Fox.<ref>By, D. W. (1934, Nov 25). TAKING A LOOK AT THE RECORD.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

[[Biological agent|Biological weapon]]s (often termed \"bio-weapons\", \"biological threat agents\", or \"bio-agents\") are living [[organism]]s or replicating entities ([[virus]]es, which are not universally considered \"alive\"). [[Entomological warfare|Entomological (insect) warfare]] is a subtype of BW. \n\nBiological warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]], [[chemical warfare]] and [[radiological warfare]], which together with biological warfare make up [[CBRN defense|CBRN]] , the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs). None of these are considered [[conventional weapons]], which are deployed primarily for their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential.\n\nBiological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some [[chemical weapon]]s, biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapon]]s. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups.

The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants).

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).
