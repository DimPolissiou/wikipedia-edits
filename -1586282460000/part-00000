Cusco was the center of the Inka Empire: the Inka-Spanish cronicler [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] states<ref name=\"garcilaso\">Garcilaso Inca de la Vega \u2013 \"Primera parte de los comentarios reales de los incas, escrita por Garcilaso Inca de la Vega y publicada en 1609, en Lisboa\" --- http://museogarcilaso.pe/mediaelement/pdf/3-ComentariosReales.pdf</ref> that \"Cozco in the language of the Incas means navel that is the Earth's navel\". \nThe four regions were named ''Chinchaysuyu'' towards the North, ''Collasuysu'' towards the South, ''Antisuyu'' towards the East and the lower valleys of the Amazon region and ''Contisuyu'' towards the West and the lower valleys along the Pacific coast.\n\nThe route towards the North was the most important in the Inka Empire, as shown by its constructive characteristics: a width ranging between 3 and 16 m<ref name=\"hyslop\"/>{{rp|108}} and the size of the archaeological vestiges that mark the way both in its vicinity and in its area of influence. It is not coincidental that this path goes through and organizes the most important administrative centers of the Tawantinsuyu outside Cusco like [[Vilcashuam\u00e1n]], [[Jauja|Xauxa]], [[Tarmatambo]], Pumpu, Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa, [[Cajamarca]] and [[Huancabamba]], in current territories of Peru; and [[Ingapirca]], [[Tomebamba]] or [[Riobamba]] in Ecuador. This was regarded by the Incas as \"the\" Qhapaq \u00d1an, main road or royal road, starting from Cusco and arriving to Quito. From Quito nortwards, the Inka presence is perceived in defensive settlements that mark the advance of the Empire by the Ecuadorian provinces of [[Carchi Province|Carchi]] and [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] and the current [[Nari\u00f1o Department]] in Colombia, which in the 16th century was in process of being incorporated into the Inka Empire.<ref name=\"lumbreras\">Lumbreras, Luis Guillermo (2004).Presentaci\u00f3n.

From there the roads were unfolding to advance towards the southernmost boundaries of the Tawantinsuyu. One branch headed towards the current Mendoza region of Argentina, while the other penetrated the ancient territories of the [[Diaguita]] and [[Atacama people]] in Chilean lands, who had already developed basic road networks. From there, crossing the driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert, the Qollasuyu route reached the Maipo river, currently in the [[Santiago]] metropolitan region. From there no vestiges of the Inka advance have been found.<ref name=\"lumbreras\"/>\n\nContisuyu roads allowed to connect Cusco to coastal territories, in what corresponds to the current regions of [[Arequipa]], [[Moquegua]] and [[Tacna]], in the extreme Peruvian south. These roads are transversal routes that guaranteed the complementarity of natural resources, since they cross very varied ecological floors, in the varied altitude of the descent from the heights of the cordillera to the coastal spaces.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe roads of the Antisuyu are the least known and a lesser number of vestiges were registered. They penetrated into the territories of the ''Ceja de Jungla'' or Amazonian Andes leading to the [[Amazon rainforest]], where conditions are more difficult for the conservation of archaeological evidences. The true physical extension of the Inka Empire for this region is not very clear.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\n==Purposes of the road==\n[[File:Qapaq Nan at Mosollaqta lake DSC 2822.jpg|thumb|a view of the Inka road climbing a hillside at the Mosollaqta  lake, Peru]]\nThe Inkas used the road system for a variety of reasons, from transportation for people who were traveling through the Empire to military and religious purposes.<ref name =\"Cartwright\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/757/|title= Mark Cartwright \"The Inca Road System\", 2014 |website=Ancient.eu|accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>  The road system allowed for a fast movement of persons from one part of the Empire to the other: both armies and workers used the roads to move and the tambos to rest and be fed.

The Inkas had a predilection for the use of the [[Altiplano]], or ''puna'' areas, for displacement, seeking to avoid contact with the populations settled in the valleys, and project, at the same time, a straight route of rapid communication.

As an example, the administrative center of [[Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa]] includes 497 collcas, which totaled as much as {{convert|37,100|m3|cuft}} and could support a population of between twelve and fifteen thousand people.<ref name=\"Jenkins 2001 659\"/> Cotapachi (nowadays in the Bolivian region of [[Cochabamba]]) included a group of 2,400 collcas far away from any significant village.\nCollcas were long term storage houses, primarily for the storage of grains and maize,<ref>{{cite news|last=Fellman|first=Bruce|title=Rediscovering Mach Picchu|year=2002|magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine}}</ref> which had an extremely long expiration date and made them ideal for long term storage for the army in the event of conflicts.<ref name=Vergara/>{{rp|308}}\n\nAccording to Hyslop<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> the use of the Inka road system was reserved to authorities.

The redistribution of goods was known as [[vertical archipelago]]: this system was the basis for trade throughout the Inka Empire.<ref name=\"D'Altroy1992\"/>{{rp|118}} Different sections of the Empire had different resources. The roads were used to send out the resources to other parts of the Empire that were in need of them. This is one of the reasons why the Inka Empire was so powerful: they not only had a multitude of resources, but a set system to make sure all parts of the Empire were able to obtain what they needed.<ref name=\"D'Altroy1992\"/>{{rp|120}} \nNevertheless, scholars<ref name=\"garrido\"/><ref name=\"Nielsen\">Nielsen, Alex (2000). Andean Caravans: An Ethnoarchaeology Ph.D. Dissertation in Anthropology - University of Arizona - Tucson</ref> have noted that there was a possible barter of goods along the roads between caravanners and villagers: a sort of \"secondary exchange\" and \"daily swapping\".\n\n===Military===\nThese roads provided easy, reliable and quick routes for the Empire's administrative and military communications, personnel movement, and logistical support. After conquering a territory and convincing the local lord to become an ally, the Inka distributed valuable gifts, but also took care of developing military-political strategy in extending the road system to cover the new dominated territories.<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> \nThe Qhapaq \u00d1an thus became a permanent symbol of the ideological presence of the Inka dominion in the newly conquered place. The road system allowed for the displacement of imperial troops, to prepare for new conquests, to quell uprisings and rebellions, but it was also used for sharing with the dominated populations the surplus goods that the Inka produced and stored annually for the purpose of redistribution. The army moved frequently, mostly in military action but also to support civil works.<ref name=\"mattos\"/>\nThe forts or pukaras were mainly located in the border areas, as a spatial indicator of the process of progressing and annexing new territories to the Empire. In fact, the greater number of pukaras are found towards the north of the Tawantinsuyu, as witnesses to the work of incorporating the northern territories, rich of pastures. To the south there are abundant remains, around Mendoza in Argentina and along the Maipo river in Chile, where the presence of forts marks the line of the road at the southernmost point of the Empire.<ref name=\"martinez\"/><ref group=\"note\">Out of about 200 known pukaras 100 of them are found in Northern Ecuador and 30 of them in Northern Chile and Argentina.

Mountains are the ''apus'', or deities, in the universe of Andean beliefs that are still holding today; they have a spiritual connotation linked to the future of Nature and human existence. This is why the Incas held many rituals, including the sacrifice of children, goods, and llamas, at the mountain tops, but not all mountains had the same religious connotation nor in all of them sanctuaries were built. The only way to reach the summits of the mountains for worship was by connecting the road system to high altitude paths in order to reach the sacred places. They were ritual roads that culminated in the peaks, at the point of contact between the earthly and the sacred space. Some of them reached high altitudes above sea level, such as mount Cha\u00f1i, which had a road that started at the base and went to the summit at an elevation of {{convert|5,949|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vitry|first=Christian|title=Roads for Rituals and Sacred Mountains.

These shrines were either natural or modified features of the landscape, as well as buildings, where the Inka would visit for worship.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\" />{{rp|163}}\n\nSome important places of worship were directly connected by the main Inka roads.

This latter had developed around Lake Titicaca, in the current territories of Peru and Bolivia, between the 6th and 12th centuries CE, and had set up a complex and advanced civilization.

[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] succeeded to Pachakutiq, and conquered the [[Chim\u00fa culture|Chimu]] reaching the far north region of [[Quito]] around 1463; later he extended the conquests to the jungle region of [[Charcas Province|Charcas]] and, in the south, to Chile.<ref name=\"rosto2015\"/>\n\n===Colonial era===\nDuring the first years of the Colony, the Qhapaq \u00d1an suffered a stage of abandonment and destruction caused by the abrupt decrease of the number of natives due to illness and war<ref>Gareis, Iris 1997).

Huamanga hasta 1640 - Alianza editorial - Madrid</ref> which reduced the population from more than 12 million people to about 1,1 million in 50 years<ref name =\"colapso\"/> and destroyed the social structure that provided labor for road maintenance. The use of the Inka roads became partial and was adapted to the new political and economic targets of the Colony and later of the Viceroyalty where the economic structure was based on the extraction of minerals and commercial production.  This implied a dramatic change in the use of the territory. The former integration of longitudinal and transversal territories was reduced to a connection of the Andean valleys and the Altiplano with the coast to allow for the export of products, especially gold and silver, which started flowing to the coast and from there to Spain.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\nA key factor in the dismantling of the network at the subcontinental level was the opening of new routes to connect the emerging production centers (estates and mines) with the coastal ports. In this context, only those routes that covered the new needs were used, abandoning the rest, particularly those that connected to the forts built during the advance of the Inka Empire or those that linked the agricultural spaces with the administrative centres. Nevertheless, the ritual roads that allowed access to the sanctuaries continued to be used under the religious syncretism that has been characterizing the Andean historical moments since the conquest.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nCieza de Leon in 1553 noted the abandonment of the road and stated that ''although in many places it is already broken down and undone, it shows the great thing that it was''.<ref>\u00abaunque por muchos lugares est\u00e1 ya desbaratado y deshecho, da muestra de la grande cosa que fue\u00bb. Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n, \"Cr\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa. Primera parte\" Pontificia  Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa \u2013 Academia Nacional de la Historia 1995 [1553]</ref> \nThe admiration of the chroniclers was not enough to convince the Spanish ruler of the need to maintain and consolidate the road system rather than abandoning and destroying it. The reduction of the local population to newly built settlements (known as ''[[Indian reductions in the Andes|reducciones]]'', a sort of concentration camps) was among the causes of the abandonment of the Inka roads and the building of new ones to connect the ''reducciones'' to the centers of Spanish power.<ref name= \"bar\"/> Another important factor was the inadequacy of the road for horses and mules introduced by the conquerors, that became the new pack animals, substituting for the lightweight llamas.\n\nEven the new agriculture, derived from Spain, consisting mainly of cereals, changed the appearance of the territory, which was sometimes transformed, cutting and joining several [[and\u00e9n|andenes]] (farming terraces), which in turn reduced the fertile soil due to erosion form rain. The pre-Hispanic agricultural technologies were abandoned or displaced towards marginal spaces, relegated by the colonizers.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nPart of the network continued to be used, as well as some of its equipment, such as the tambos, which were transformed into stores and shops, adjusting to the tradition of Spain, where peasant production was taken to them for selling. The tambos entered a new stage as meeting spaces for different ways of life that irremediably ended up integrating new social and territorial structures.<ref>Glave, L. M (1989). Caminos ind\u00edgenas en la sociedad colonial. Siglos XVI-XVII \u2013 Instituto de Apoyo Agrario, Lima</ref>\n\n===Post-colonial and modern times===\nAfter the independence from Spain the American republics, throughout the 19th century, did not provide significant changes to the territory. In the case of Peru, the territorial structure established by the Colony was maintained while the link between the production of the mountains and the coast was consolidated under a logic of extraction and export.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe construction of modern roads and railways was adapted to this logic. It gave priority to the communication with the coasts and was complemented by transversal axes of penetration into the inter-Andean valleys for the channeling of production towards the coastal axis and its seaports. At the end of the eighteen century, large estates were developed for the supply of raw materials to international markets, together with [[guano]], so the maritime ports of Peru took on special relevance<ref name=\"martinez\"/> and intense activity requiring an adequate accessibility from the production spaces. Some parts of the Inka roads were still in use in the south of the Altiplano giving access to the main centers for the production of [[alpaca]] and [[vicu\u00f1a]] wools, which were in high demand in the international markets.\n\nThe twentieth century organization of roads along the Andes gave priority to the Pan-American highway along the coast, following roughly the traces of the coastal Inka road. This highway was then connected to west-east routes into the valleys while the north-south Inka road up the mountains was mostly reduced to local pedestrian transit.\n\nIn 2014 the road system became a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = How the Inca Empire Engineered a Road Across Some of the World's Most Extreme Terrain|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-inca-empire-engineered-road-would-endure-centuries-180955709/|website=Smithsonianmag.com|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture and engineering of the Inka roads==\n[[File:Bridge guardian.jpg|thumb|Manager of the inka bridges]]\n[[File:Qhapaq_\u00d1an_Poma_de_Ayala.jpg|thumb|Manager of the royal roads]]\nThe Inkas built their road system by expanding and reinforcing several pre-existing smaller networks of roads, adapting and improving previous infrastructures, setting up a system of formal roads and providing a maintenance system that would protect the roads and facilitate the displacements and the exchange of people, goods and information. The outcome was a great road network of subcontinental dimensions, which, from Cusco, was directed in the four cardinal directions that marked the territorial division of Tawnatinsuyu, which allowed the Inka and his officers to have knowledge of everything that circulated on the roads, however far away they were.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe Inkas developed techniques to overcome the difficult territory of the [[Andes]]: on steep slopes they built stone steps, while in desert areas near the coast they built low walls to keep the sand from drifting over the road.<ref name=Vergara>{{Cite book | last=Vergara | first=Teresa | title=Historia del Peru, Tahuantinsuyu | year=2000 | publisher=Lexus Editores | location=Spain  | isbn=9972-625-35-4 }}</ref>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Construction and maintenance===\nThe manpower required for both construction and maintenance was obtained through the [[Mit'a|mita]]: a sort of tax work, provided to the state by the conquered people, by which the Inka Empire produced the required goods and performed the necessary services, which included the upkeep of roads and their relevant infrastructures (bridges, tambos, warehouses, etc.).<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\nThe labor was organized by officials who were in charge of the development, control and operation of roads and bridges, as well as communications. The chronicler [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]]<ref>Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala, Felipe \"Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno\", 1614 - G. Y. Franklin Pease edition - Lima: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica \u2013 1993</ref> noted that these authorities were chosen among the noble relatives of the Inka, residents of Cusco. There were three main officials: the manager of the royal roads, the manager of bridges, the manager of chasquis. There were also several ''amojonadores'' or builders of landmarks.\n\n===Architectural components ===\nHyslop<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> noted that there was no road construction standard, because the roads were set in such varied environments and landscapes.\n\n====Roadway and pavement====\nIn the mountains and the high forests, precisely arranged paving stones or cobbles were used for paving, placing them with their flat face towards the top, trying to produce a uniform surface. \nNevertheless, not all the roads were paved; in the Andean puna and in the coastal deserts the road was usually made using packed earth, sand, or simply covering grassland with soil or sand.<ref name=\"Cartwright\"/> \nThere is also evidence of paving with vegetable fibers such as in the road of Pampa Afuera in Casma (\u00c1ncash department, Peru).<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\nThe width of the roadway varied between {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft}},<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\" />{{rp|245}} although some could be much wider, such as the {{convert|25|m|ft}} road leading to Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa. \nThe Cusco to Quito portion of the Road system, which was the most trafficked one, had a width always exceeding {{convert|4|m|ft}} even in agricultural areas where the land had high value. Some portions reached a width of {{convert|16|m|ft}}.<ref>Brown, Jeff L. (2016). Highways to the Empire: the Inca road system\" - Civil Engineering, January 2016</ref>\nNear urban and administrative centers there is evidence of two or three roads constructed in parallel.<ref name =\"Cartwright\"/>\nThe maximum recorded width on the north coastal road is {{convert|35|m|ft}}, while the average width in the south coastal road is {{convert|8.5|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Side walls and stone rows====\nStones and walls served to mark the width of the road and signal it. On the coast and in the mountains, the availability of construction materials such as stone and mud for preparing [[adobe]]s allowed to build walls on both sides of the road, to isolate it from agricultural land so that the walkers and caravans traveled without affecting the crops. In the flatlands and in the deserts, these walls most probably prevented sand from covering the road.<ref name=\"guia\"/> In the absence of walls, the roads in the more deserted areas also used stone rows and wooden poles driven into the sand as route markers. Stone rows were built with stones of similar sizes and shapes, placed next to each other and located on one or both edges of the road, arranged in a sort of curb. In some cases it has been observed that the sides of these stones were edged.\n\n====Furrows ====\nAlthough it is not strictly a construction element used to delimit the edges of the road, there are cases in which furrows delimit the road on both sides. Examples of these furrows have been found in the coastal area located south of the Chala district in Arequipa.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Retaining walls ====\nRetaining walls were made with stones, adobes or mud and were built on the hillsides. These walls contained leveling fillings to form the platform of the road or to support the soil that could otherwise slide down the slope, as is generally seen in the transversal roads that lead to the coast from the mountains.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Drainage====\nDrainage by ditches or culverts was more frequent in the mountains and jungle due to the constant rainfall. Along other road sections, the drainage of rain water was carried out through an articulated system based on longitudinal channels and shorter drains, transverse to the axis of the road. Retaining walls were used along the mountain slopes, and are similar to those used to support the terraces. When crossing wetlands, roads were often supported by buttress walls or built on causeways.<ref name =\"Cartwright\"/>\n\n====Road marks====\nAt given distances the direction of the road was marked with stone piles (''mojones'' in Spanish) a sort of ''milestones'', generally placed on both sides of the road. They were columns of well piled stones with a surmounting stone and often strategically placed on rises in order to be spotted from long distances.<ref>Lynch, Thomas F. (1996). Inka roads in the Atacama: effects of later use by mounted travelers -  Di\u00e1logo andino 14/15 1996 - University of Tarapac\u00e1 \u2013 Arica Chile</ref>\n[[File:Cartel_de_distancias_en_Abra_del_Acay.jpg|thumb|An ''apacheta'' in the southern part of the Inka road system in the current province of [[Salta]], Argentina]]\n\nThe ''apachetas'' (South American [[cairn]]s) were mounds of stones of different sizes, formed through gradual accumulation by the travelers, who deposited stones as an offering to preserve their travel from setbacks and allow for its successful conclusion. The apachetas were located on the side of the roads in transitional spaces such as passes or \"points of interest\" for travellers. This practice was condemned for its pagan character during the Colony and the Viceroyalty, when priests were ordered to dismantle them and plant crosses instead. Nevertheless, the tradition of making apachetas was not discontinued and crosses or altars of different sizes were accompanied by mounds of stone.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\n====Paintings and mock-ups====\nSome places such as rock shelters or cliffs show rock paintings next to the roads, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of the signalization. The generally zoomorphic painted representations correspond to stylized camelids, in the typical Inka design and color. Figures directly carved on the stone are also found.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nRocks of varying size at the road side can represent the shapes of the mountains or important glaciers of the region, as an expression of the sacralization of geography; they can be made up of one or more rocks.\n\n===Causeways===\nIn damp areas embankments were built to produce causeways, in rocky terrain it was necessary to dig the path in the rock or to drive it through an artificial terrace with retaining walls<ref name=\"krzano\"/>\nSome important causeways such as on the coast of Lake Titicaca were built to take into account the periodic variation of the lake level due to alternating rainy and dry seasons. They had stone bridges to allow the free flow of water below them.\n\n===Stairways===\nIn order to overcome the limitations imposed by the roughness of the relief and the adverse environmental conditions, the Inka engineers designed different solutions. On rocky outcrops the road became narrower, adapting to the orography with frequent turns and retaining walls, but on particularly steep slopes flights of stairs or ramps were built or carved in the rock.\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Inka suspension bridge Qeswachaka DSC 2730.jpg|thumb|A typical example of an Inka suspension (catenary) bridge on the Apurimac River near Huinchiri, Peru]]\nThere were multiple types of bridges used throughout the road system and they were sometimes built in pairs.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\"/>{{rp|245\u201346}} Some bridges were made of parallel logs tied together with ropes and covered with earth and vegetal fibers supported by stone abutments,<ref name=\"camino\"/> while others were built of stone slabs resting on piled stones. One of the difficulties of creating wooden bridges was obtaining logs. Sometimes, the laborers who were making the bridges had to bring the lumber from very far away. Wooden bridges would be replaced about every eight years.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|637}}\n\nThe construction of bridges was accomplished by the help of many workers. It implied first of all the constructions of abutments, normally made of stone both rough and dressed. The masonry could even be extremely well fitted, with no evidence of any mortar being used to keep the stones in place.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|638}} Inkas, having no iron, used a method of stone working which used simple tools, such as [[hammerstone]]s, to pound the rocks in a way that the contours of the upper rock matched those of the rock below so that the seams fit perfectly without mortar.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\"/>{{rp|310}}\nFor simple log bridges, the construction was done by placing a series of logs over projecting canes.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|632}} \nStone bridges could span shorter lengths and needed shallower rivers to be built . Some slabs were placed over the abutments and intermediate stone pillars when necessary. A very special stone bridge was recently discovered in Bolivia consisting of a relatively small opening to allow the stream to flow and a quite imposing stone embankment filling the valley sides in order to allow the road to pass on top of it.<ref name=\"raffino\"/>\n\n[[File:Sketch of the Rumicahka bridge.jpg|thumb|a sketch of the rumichaka in the Tarija region, Bolivia]]\n\nTo cross rivers flat banks, floating reeds tied together were used, forming of a row of ''[[Schoenoplectus californicus|totora]]'' boats placed side to side and covered with a board of totora and earth.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|632}}\n\n[[Inca rope bridge]]s also provided access across narrow valleys. A bridge across the Apur\u00edmac River, west of Cusco, spanned a distance of {{convert|45|m|ft}}. Rope bridges had to be replaced about every two years: to this end, the communities around the river crossing were commanded into a ''mita'' for the construction of the new bridge, while the old bridge was cut and let fall into the river. This type of bridge was built with ropes of vegetable fibers, such as ''ichu'' (Stipa ichu) a fiber typical of the Altiplano, which were tied together to form cords and ropes which constituted the bridge floor cables, the two handrails and the necessary connections between them.\n\nRavines were sometimes crossed by hanging baskets, or ''oroyas'', which could span distances of over {{convert|50|m|ft}}.\n[[File:Oroya DSC 1981.jpg|thumb|An \"oroya\" or basket to cross rivers. watercolor on paper portrayed in the Lima \"MALI\" museum, Anonymous - public domain]]\n\n===Tunnel===\nTo access the famous Apur\u00edmac rope bridge it was necessary for the road to reach the narrowest section of the gorge: to this end, the road was cut along a natural fault into the steep rock of the valley and a tunnel was carved to facilitate the way. The tunnel had a series of side openings allowing the light to come in. There is no evidence of other tunnels along the Inka roads.<ref>Bauer, Brian (----). Suspension Bridges of the Inca Empire\" - http://www.academia.edu/6953894/Suspension_Bridges_of_the_Inca_Empire</ref>  \n<ref>Squier, Ephrahim George (1877). Peru, incidents of travel and exploration of the land of Incas, New York</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\nGarcilaso de la Vega<ref name=\"garcilaso\"/> underlines the presence of infrastructure on the Inka road system where all across the Empire lodging posts for state officials and chasqui messengers were ubiquitous, well-spaced and well provisioned. Food, clothes, and weapons were also stored and kept ready for the Inka army marching through the territory.<ref name=\"garrido\"/>\n\nThe tambos were the most numerous and perhaps more important buildings in the operation of the road network. They were constructions of varied architecture and size whose function was mainly the lodging of the travellers and the storage of products for their supply. For this reason, they were located at a day's journey interval, although irregularities were identified in their distances, probably linked to various factors such as the presence of water sources, the existence of land with agricultural produce or the presence of pre-Inka centers.<ref name=\"martinez\"/> The tambos were most probably administered by the local populations since many of them are associated with settlements with additional constructions for different uses, such as ''canchas'' (rectangular enclosures bordered by a wall, probably used as accommodation for walkers), and collcas and ''kallancas''. These latter were rectangular buildings of considerable size, which the Conquistadors called barns for their length. They were used for ceremonies and for accommodation of diverse nature: members of the Inka or local elites, mitimaes or other travelers.<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> Tambos were so frequent that many Andean regional place names include the word tambo in them.\n\nAt the roadside the ''chasquiwasis'', or relay stations for the Inka messenger chasqui, were frequent. In these places the chasquis waited for the messages they had to take to other locations. The fast flow of information was important for an Empire that was in constant expansion. The ''chasquiwasis'' were normally quite small and there is little archaeological evidence and research on them.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n==Inka Trail to Machu Picchu==\n{{main|Inca Trail to Machu Picchu}} [[Machu Picchu]] itself was far off the beaten path,<ref>Fellman, Bruce (2002).

Cusco was the center of the Inka Empire: the Inka-Spanish cronicler [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] states<ref name=\"garcilaso\">Garcilaso Inca de la Vega \u2013 \"Primera parte de los comentarios reales de los incas, escrita por Garcilaso Inca de la Vega y publicada en 1609, en Lisboa\" --- http://museogarcilaso.pe/mediaelement/pdf/3-ComentariosReales.pdf</ref> that \"Cozco in the language of the Incas means navel that is the Earth's navel\". \nThe four regions were named ''Chinchaysuyu'' towards the North, ''Collasuysu'' towards the South, ''Antisuyu'' towards the East and the lower valleys of the Amazon region and ''Contisuyu'' towards the West and the lower valleys along the Pacific coast.\n\nThe route towards the North was the most important in the Inka Empire, as shown by its constructive characteristics: a width ranging between 3 and 16 m<ref name=\"hyslop\"/>{{rp|108}} and the size of the archaeological vestiges that mark the way both in its vicinity and in its area of influence. It is not coincidental that this path goes through and organizes the most important administrative centers of the Tawantinsuyu outside Cusco like [[Vilcashuam\u00e1n]], [[Jauja|Xauxa]], [[Tarmatambo]], Pumpu, Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa, [[Cajamarca]] and [[Huancabamba]], in current territories of Peru; and [[Ingapirca]], [[Tomebamba]] or [[Riobamba]] in Ecuador. This was regarded by the Incas as \"the\" Qhapaq \u00d1an, main road or royal road, starting from Cusco and arriving to Quito. From Quito nortwards, the Inka presence is perceived in defensive settlements that mark the advance of the Empire by the Ecuadorian provinces of [[Carchi Province|Carchi]] and [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] and the current [[Nari\u00f1o Department]] in Colombia, which in the 16th century was in process of being incorporated into the Inka Empire.<ref name=\"lumbreras\">Lumbreras, Luis Guillermo (2004).Presentaci\u00f3n.

From there the roads were unfolding to advance towards the southernmost boundaries of the Tawantinsuyu. One branch headed towards the current Mendoza region of Argentina, while the other penetrated the ancient territories of the [[Diaguita]] and [[Atacama people]] in Chilean lands, who had already developed basic road networks. From there, crossing the driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert, the Qollasuyu route reached the Maipo river, currently in the [[Santiago]] metropolitan region. From there no vestiges of the Inka advance have been found.<ref name=\"lumbreras\"/>\n\nContisuyu roads allowed to connect Cusco to coastal territories, in what corresponds to the current regions of [[Arequipa]], [[Moquegua]] and [[Tacna]], in the extreme Peruvian south. These roads are transversal routes that guaranteed the complementarity of natural resources, since they cross very varied ecological floors, in the varied altitude of the descent from the heights of the cordillera to the coastal spaces.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe roads of the Antisuyu are the least known and a lesser number of vestiges were registered. They penetrated into the territories of the ''Ceja de Jungla'' or Amazonian Andes leading to the [[Amazon rainforest]], where conditions are more difficult for the conservation of archaeological evidences. The true physical extension of the Inka Empire for this region is not very clear.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\n==Purposes of the road==\n[[File:Qapaq Nan at Mosollaqta lake DSC 2822.jpg|thumb|a view of the Inka road climbing a hillside at the Mosollaqta  lake, Peru]]\nThe Inkas used the road system for a variety of reasons, from transportation for people who were traveling through the Empire to military and religious purposes.<ref name =\"Cartwright\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/757/|title= Mark Cartwright \"The Inca Road System\", 2014 |website=Ancient.eu|accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>  The road system allowed for a fast movement of persons from one part of the Empire to the other: both armies and workers used the roads to move and the tambos to rest and be fed.

The Inkas had a predilection for the use of the [[Altiplano]], or ''puna'' areas, for displacement, seeking to avoid contact with the populations settled in the valleys, and project, at the same time, a straight route of rapid communication.

As an example, the administrative center of [[Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa]] includes 497 collcas, which totaled as much as {{convert|37,100|m3|cuft}} and could support a population of between twelve and fifteen thousand people.<ref name=\"Jenkins 2001 659\"/> Cotapachi (nowadays in the Bolivian region of [[Cochabamba]]) included a group of 2,400 collcas far away from any significant village.\nCollcas were long term storage houses, primarily for the storage of grains and maize,<ref>{{cite news|last=Fellman|first=Bruce|title=Rediscovering Mach Picchu|year=2002|magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine}}</ref> which had an extremely long expiration date and made them ideal for long term storage for the army in the event of conflicts.<ref name=Vergara/>{{rp|308}}\n\nAccording to Hyslop<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> the use of the Inka road system was reserved to authorities.

The redistribution of goods was known as [[vertical archipelago]]: this system was the basis for trade throughout the Inka Empire.<ref name=\"D'Altroy1992\"/>{{rp|118}} Different sections of the Empire had different resources. The roads were used to send out the resources to other parts of the Empire that were in need of them. This is one of the reasons why the Inka Empire was so powerful: they not only had a multitude of resources, but a set system to make sure all parts of the Empire were able to obtain what they needed.<ref name=\"D'Altroy1992\"/>{{rp|120}} \nNevertheless, scholars<ref name=\"garrido\"/><ref name=\"Nielsen\">Nielsen, Alex (2000). Andean Caravans: An Ethnoarchaeology Ph.D. Dissertation in Anthropology - University of Arizona - Tucson</ref> have noted that there was a possible barter of goods along the roads between caravanners and villagers: a sort of \"secondary exchange\" and \"daily swapping\".\n\n===Military===\nThese roads provided easy, reliable and quick routes for the Empire's administrative and military communications, personnel movement, and logistical support. After conquering a territory and convincing the local lord to become an ally, the Inka distributed valuable gifts, but also took care of developing military-political strategy in extending the road system to cover the new dominated territories.<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> \nThe Qhapaq \u00d1an thus became a permanent symbol of the ideological presence of the Inka dominion in the newly conquered place. The road system allowed for the displacement of imperial troops, to prepare for new conquests, to quell uprisings and rebellions, but it was also used for sharing with the dominated populations the surplus goods that the Inka produced and stored annually for the purpose of redistribution. The army moved frequently, mostly in military action but also to support civil works.<ref name=\"mattos\"/>\nThe forts or pukaras were mainly located in the border areas, as a spatial indicator of the process of progressing and annexing new territories to the Empire. In fact, the greater number of pukaras are found towards the north of the Tawantinsuyu, as witnesses to the work of incorporating the northern territories, rich of pastures. To the south there are abundant remains, around Mendoza in Argentina and along the Maipo river in Chile, where the presence of forts marks the line of the road at the southernmost point of the Empire.<ref name=\"martinez\"/><ref group=\"note\">Out of about 200 known pukaras 100 of them are found in Northern Ecuador and 30 of them in Northern Chile and Argentina.

Mountains are the ''apus'', or deities, in the universe of Andean beliefs that are still holding today; they have a spiritual connotation linked to the future of Nature and human existence. This is why the Incas held many rituals, including the sacrifice of children, goods, and llamas, at the mountain tops, but not all mountains had the same religious connotation nor in all of them sanctuaries were built. The only way to reach the summits of the mountains for worship was by connecting the road system to high altitude paths in order to reach the sacred places. They were ritual roads that culminated in the peaks, at the point of contact between the earthly and the sacred space. Some of them reached high altitudes above sea level, such as mount Cha\u00f1i, which had a road that started at the base and went to the summit at an elevation of {{convert|5,949|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vitry|first=Christian|title=Roads for Rituals and Sacred Mountains.

These shrines were either natural or modified features of the landscape, as well as buildings, where the Inka would visit for worship.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\" />{{rp|163}}\n\nSome important places of worship were directly connected by the main Inka roads.

This latter had developed around Lake Titicaca, in the current territories of Peru and Bolivia, between the 6th and 12th centuries CE, and had set up a complex and advanced civilization.

The use of the Inka roads became partial and was adapted to the new political and economic targets of the Colony and later of the Viceroyalty where the economic structure was based on the extraction of minerals and commercial production.  This implied a dramatic change in the use of the territory. The former integration of longitudinal and transversal territories was reduced to a connection of the Andean valleys and the Altiplano with the coast to allow for the export of products, especially gold and silver, which started flowing to the coast and from there to Spain.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\nA key factor in the dismantling of the network at the subcontinental level was the opening of new routes to connect the emerging production centers (estates and mines) with the coastal ports. In this context, only those routes that covered the new needs were used, abandoning the rest, particularly those that connected to the forts built during the advance of the Inka Empire or those that linked the agricultural spaces with the administrative centres. Nevertheless, the ritual roads that allowed access to the sanctuaries continued to be used under the religious syncretism that has been characterizing the Andean historical moments since the conquest.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nCieza de Leon in 1553 noted the abandonment of the road and stated that ''although in many places it is already broken down and undone, it shows the great thing that it was''.<ref>\u00abaunque por muchos lugares est\u00e1 ya desbaratado y deshecho, da muestra de la grande cosa que fue\u00bb. Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n, \"Cr\u00f3nica del Per\u00fa. Primera parte\" Pontificia  Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa \u2013 Academia Nacional de la Historia 1995 [1553]</ref> \nThe admiration of the chroniclers was not enough to convince the Spanish ruler of the need to maintain and consolidate the road system rather than abandoning and destroying it. The reduction of the local population to newly built settlements (known as ''[[Indian reductions in the Andes|reducciones]]'', a sort of concentration camps) was among the causes of the abandonment of the Inka roads and the building of new ones to connect the ''reducciones'' to the centers of Spanish power.<ref name= \"bar\"/> Another important factor was the inadequacy of the road for horses and mules introduced by the conquerors, that became the new pack animals, substituting for the lightweight llamas.\n\nEven the new agriculture, derived from Spain, consisting mainly of cereals, changed the appearance of the territory, which was sometimes transformed, cutting and joining several [[and\u00e9n|andenes]] (farming terraces), which in turn reduced the fertile soil due to erosion form rain. The pre-Hispanic agricultural technologies were abandoned or displaced towards marginal spaces, relegated by the colonizers.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nPart of the network continued to be used, as well as some of its equipment, such as the tambos, which were transformed into stores and shops, adjusting to the tradition of Spain, where peasant production was taken to them for selling. The tambos entered a new stage as meeting spaces for different ways of life that irremediably ended up integrating new social and territorial structures.<ref>Glave, L. M (1989). Caminos ind\u00edgenas en la sociedad colonial. Siglos XVI-XVII \u2013 Instituto de Apoyo Agrario, Lima</ref>\n\n===Post-colonial and modern times===\nAfter the independence from Spain the American republics, throughout the 19th century, did not provide significant changes to the territory. In the case of Peru, the territorial structure established by the Colony was maintained while the link between the production of the mountains and the coast was consolidated under a logic of extraction and export.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe construction of modern roads and railways was adapted to this logic. It gave priority to the communication with the coasts and was complemented by transversal axes of penetration into the inter-Andean valleys for the channeling of production towards the coastal axis and its seaports. At the end of the eighteen century, large estates were developed for the supply of raw materials to international markets, together with [[guano]], so the maritime ports of Peru took on special relevance<ref name=\"martinez\"/> and intense activity requiring an adequate accessibility from the production spaces. Some parts of the Inka roads were still in use in the south of the Altiplano giving access to the main centers for the production of [[alpaca]] and [[vicu\u00f1a]] wools, which were in high demand in the international markets.\n\nThe twentieth century organization of roads along the Andes gave priority to the Pan-American highway along the coast, following roughly the traces of the coastal Inka road. This highway was then connected to west-east routes into the valleys while the north-south Inka road up the mountains was mostly reduced to local pedestrian transit.\n\nIn 2014 the road system became a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = How the Inca Empire Engineered a Road Across Some of the World's Most Extreme Terrain|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-inca-empire-engineered-road-would-endure-centuries-180955709/|website=Smithsonianmag.com|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture and engineering of the Inka roads==\n[[File:Bridge guardian.jpg|thumb|Manager of the inka bridges]]\n[[File:Qhapaq_\u00d1an_Poma_de_Ayala.jpg|thumb|Manager of the royal roads]]\nThe Inkas built their road system by expanding and reinforcing several pre-existing smaller networks of roads, adapting and improving previous infrastructures, setting up a system of formal roads and providing a maintenance system that would protect the roads and facilitate the displacements and the exchange of people, goods and information. The outcome was a great road network of subcontinental dimensions, which, from Cusco, was directed in the four cardinal directions that marked the territorial division of Tawnatinsuyu, which allowed the Inka and his officers to have knowledge of everything that circulated on the roads, however far away they were.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nThe Inkas developed techniques to overcome the difficult territory of the [[Andes]]: on steep slopes they built stone steps, while in desert areas near the coast they built low walls to keep the sand from drifting over the road.<ref name=Vergara>{{Cite book | last=Vergara | first=Teresa | title=Historia del Peru, Tahuantinsuyu | year=2000 | publisher=Lexus Editores | location=Spain  | isbn=9972-625-35-4 }}</ref>{{rp|301}}\n\n===Construction and maintenance===\nThe manpower required for both construction and maintenance was obtained through the [[Mit'a|mita]]: a sort of tax work, provided to the state by the conquered people, by which the Inka Empire produced the required goods and performed the necessary services, which included the upkeep of roads and their relevant infrastructures (bridges, tambos, warehouses, etc.).<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\nThe labor was organized by officials who were in charge of the development, control and operation of roads and bridges, as well as communications. The chronicler [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]]<ref>Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala, Felipe \"Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno\", 1614 - G. Y. Franklin Pease edition - Lima: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica \u2013 1993</ref> noted that these authorities were chosen among the noble relatives of the Inka, residents of Cusco. There were three main officials: the manager of the royal roads, the manager of bridges, the manager of chasquis. There were also several ''amojonadores'' or builders of landmarks.\n\n===Architectural components ===\nHyslop<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> noted that there was no road construction standard, because the roads were set in such varied environments and landscapes.\n\n====Roadway and pavement====\nIn the mountains and the high forests, precisely arranged paving stones or cobbles were used for paving, placing them with their flat face towards the top, trying to produce a uniform surface. \nNevertheless, not all the roads were paved; in the Andean puna and in the coastal deserts the road was usually made using packed earth, sand, or simply covering grassland with soil or sand.<ref name=\"Cartwright\"/> \nThere is also evidence of paving with vegetable fibers such as in the road of Pampa Afuera in Casma (\u00c1ncash department, Peru).<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\nThe width of the roadway varied between {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft}},<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\" />{{rp|245}} although some could be much wider, such as the {{convert|25|m|ft}} road leading to Hu\u00e1nuco Pampa. \nThe Cusco to Quito portion of the Road system, which was the most trafficked one, had a width always exceeding {{convert|4|m|ft}} even in agricultural areas where the land had high value. Some portions reached a width of {{convert|16|m|ft}}.<ref>Brown, Jeff L. (2016). Highways to the Empire: the Inca road system\" - Civil Engineering, January 2016</ref>\nNear urban and administrative centers there is evidence of two or three roads constructed in parallel.<ref name =\"Cartwright\"/>\nThe maximum recorded width on the north coastal road is {{convert|35|m|ft}}, while the average width in the south coastal road is {{convert|8.5|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Side walls and stone rows====\nStones and walls served to mark the width of the road and signal it. On the coast and in the mountains, the availability of construction materials such as stone and mud for preparing [[adobe]]s allowed to build walls on both sides of the road, to isolate it from agricultural land so that the walkers and caravans traveled without affecting the crops. In the flatlands and in the deserts, these walls most probably prevented sand from covering the road.<ref name=\"guia\"/> In the absence of walls, the roads in the more deserted areas also used stone rows and wooden poles driven into the sand as route markers. Stone rows were built with stones of similar sizes and shapes, placed next to each other and located on one or both edges of the road, arranged in a sort of curb. In some cases it has been observed that the sides of these stones were edged.\n\n====Furrows ====\nAlthough it is not strictly a construction element used to delimit the edges of the road, there are cases in which furrows delimit the road on both sides. Examples of these furrows have been found in the coastal area located south of the Chala district in Arequipa.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Retaining walls ====\nRetaining walls were made with stones, adobes or mud and were built on the hillsides. These walls contained leveling fillings to form the platform of the road or to support the soil that could otherwise slide down the slope, as is generally seen in the transversal roads that lead to the coast from the mountains.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n====Drainage====\nDrainage by ditches or culverts was more frequent in the mountains and jungle due to the constant rainfall. Along other road sections, the drainage of rain water was carried out through an articulated system based on longitudinal channels and shorter drains, transverse to the axis of the road. Retaining walls were used along the mountain slopes, and are similar to those used to support the terraces. When crossing wetlands, roads were often supported by buttress walls or built on causeways.<ref name =\"Cartwright\"/>\n\n====Road marks====\nAt given distances the direction of the road was marked with stone piles (''mojones'' in Spanish) a sort of ''milestones'', generally placed on both sides of the road. They were columns of well piled stones with a surmounting stone and often strategically placed on rises in order to be spotted from long distances.<ref>Lynch, Thomas F. (1996). Inka roads in the Atacama: effects of later use by mounted travelers -  Di\u00e1logo andino 14/15 1996 - University of Tarapac\u00e1 \u2013 Arica Chile</ref>\n[[File:Cartel_de_distancias_en_Abra_del_Acay.jpg|thumb|An ''apacheta'' in the southern part of the Inka road system in the current province of [[Salta]], Argentina]]\n\nThe ''apachetas'' (South American [[cairn]]s) were mounds of stones of different sizes, formed through gradual accumulation by the travelers, who deposited stones as an offering to preserve their travel from setbacks and allow for its successful conclusion. The apachetas were located on the side of the roads in transitional spaces such as passes or \"points of interest\" for travellers. This practice was condemned for its pagan character during the Colony and the Viceroyalty, when priests were ordered to dismantle them and plant crosses instead. Nevertheless, the tradition of making apachetas was not discontinued and crosses or altars of different sizes were accompanied by mounds of stone.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\n====Paintings and mock-ups====\nSome places such as rock shelters or cliffs show rock paintings next to the roads, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of the signalization. The generally zoomorphic painted representations correspond to stylized camelids, in the typical Inka design and color. Figures directly carved on the stone are also found.<ref name=\"martinez\"/>\n\nRocks of varying size at the road side can represent the shapes of the mountains or important glaciers of the region, as an expression of the sacralization of geography; they can be made up of one or more rocks.\n\n===Causeways===\nIn damp areas embankments were built to produce causeways, in rocky terrain it was necessary to dig the path in the rock or to drive it through an artificial terrace with retaining walls<ref name=\"krzano\"/>\nSome important causeways such as on the coast of Lake Titicaca were built to take into account the periodic variation of the lake level due to alternating rainy and dry seasons. They had stone bridges to allow the free flow of water below them.\n\n===Stairways===\nIn order to overcome the limitations imposed by the roughness of the relief and the adverse environmental conditions, the Inka engineers designed different solutions. On rocky outcrops the road became narrower, adapting to the orography with frequent turns and retaining walls, but on particularly steep slopes flights of stairs or ramps were built or carved in the rock.\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Inka suspension bridge Qeswachaka DSC 2730.jpg|thumb|A typical example of an Inka suspension (catenary) bridge on the Apurimac River near Huinchiri, Peru]]\nThere were multiple types of bridges used throughout the road system and they were sometimes built in pairs.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\"/>{{rp|245\u201346}} Some bridges were made of parallel logs tied together with ropes and covered with earth and vegetal fibers supported by stone abutments,<ref name=\"camino\"/> while others were built of stone slabs resting on piled stones. One of the difficulties of creating wooden bridges was obtaining logs. Sometimes, the laborers who were making the bridges had to bring the lumber from very far away. Wooden bridges would be replaced about every eight years.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|637}}\n\nThe construction of bridges was accomplished by the help of many workers. It implied first of all the constructions of abutments, normally made of stone both rough and dressed. The masonry could even be extremely well fitted, with no evidence of any mortar being used to keep the stones in place.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|638}} Inkas, having no iron, used a method of stone working which used simple tools, such as [[hammerstone]]s, to pound the rocks in a way that the contours of the upper rock matched those of the rock below so that the seams fit perfectly without mortar.<ref name=\"D'Altroy2002a\"/>{{rp|310}}\nFor simple log bridges, the construction was done by placing a series of logs over projecting canes.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|632}} \nStone bridges could span shorter lengths and needed shallower rivers to be built . Some slabs were placed over the abutments and intermediate stone pillars when necessary. A very special stone bridge was recently discovered in Bolivia consisting of a relatively small opening to allow the stream to flow and a quite imposing stone embankment filling the valley sides in order to allow the road to pass on top of it.<ref name=\"raffino\"/>\n\n[[File:Sketch of the Rumicahka bridge.jpg|thumb|a sketch of the rumichaka in the Tarija region, Bolivia]]\n\nTo cross rivers flat banks, floating reeds tied together were used, forming of a row of ''[[Schoenoplectus californicus|totora]]'' boats placed side to side and covered with a board of totora and earth.<ref name=Thompson1966/>{{rp|632}}\n\n[[Inca rope bridge]]s also provided access across narrow valleys. A bridge across the Apur\u00edmac River, west of Cusco, spanned a distance of {{convert|45|m|ft}}. Rope bridges had to be replaced about every two years: to this end, the communities around the river crossing were commanded into a ''mita'' for the construction of the new bridge, while the old bridge was cut and let fall into the river. This type of bridge was built with ropes of vegetable fibers, such as ''ichu'' (Stipa ichu) a fiber typical of the Altiplano, which were tied together to form cords and ropes which constituted the bridge floor cables, the two handrails and the necessary connections between them.\n\nRavines were sometimes crossed by hanging baskets, or ''oroyas'', which could span distances of over {{convert|50|m|ft}}.\n[[File:Oroya DSC 1981.jpg|thumb|An \"oroya\" or basket to cross rivers. watercolor on paper portrayed in the Lima \"MALI\" museum, Anonymous - public domain]]\n\n===Tunnel===\nTo access the famous Apur\u00edmac rope bridge it was necessary for the road to reach the narrowest section of the gorge: to this end, the road was cut along a natural fault into the steep rock of the valley and a tunnel was carved to facilitate the way. The tunnel had a series of side openings allowing the light to come in. There is no evidence of other tunnels along the Inka roads.<ref>Bauer, Brian (----). Suspension Bridges of the Inca Empire\" - http://www.academia.edu/6953894/Suspension_Bridges_of_the_Inca_Empire</ref>  \n<ref>Squier, Ephrahim George (1877). Peru, incidents of travel and exploration of the land of Incas, New York</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\nGarcilaso de la Vega<ref name=\"garcilaso\"/> underlines the presence of infrastructure on the Inka road system where all across the Empire lodging posts for state officials and chasqui messengers were ubiquitous, well-spaced and well provisioned. Food, clothes, and weapons were also stored and kept ready for the Inka army marching through the territory.<ref name=\"garrido\"/>\n\nThe tambos were the most numerous and perhaps more important buildings in the operation of the road network. They were constructions of varied architecture and size whose function was mainly the lodging of the travellers and the storage of products for their supply. For this reason, they were located at a day's journey interval, although irregularities were identified in their distances, probably linked to various factors such as the presence of water sources, the existence of land with agricultural produce or the presence of pre-Inka centers.<ref name=\"martinez\"/> The tambos were most probably administered by the local populations since many of them are associated with settlements with additional constructions for different uses, such as ''canchas'' (rectangular enclosures bordered by a wall, probably used as accommodation for walkers), and collcas and ''kallancas''. These latter were rectangular buildings of considerable size, which the Conquistadors called barns for their length. They were used for ceremonies and for accommodation of diverse nature: members of the Inka or local elites, mitimaes or other travelers.<ref name=\"hyslop\"/> Tambos were so frequent that many Andean regional place names include the word tambo in them.\n\nAt the roadside the ''chasquiwasis'', or relay stations for the Inka messenger chasqui, were frequent. In these places the chasquis waited for the messages they had to take to other locations. The fast flow of information was important for an Empire that was in constant expansion. The ''chasquiwasis'' were normally quite small and there is little archaeological evidence and research on them.<ref name=\"guia\"/>\n\n==Inka Trail to Machu Picchu==\n{{main|Inca Trail to Machu Picchu}} [[Machu Picchu]] itself was far off the beaten path,<ref>Fellman, Bruce (2002).

After getting lost during his descent, alone, he became weak and exhausted.  Instead of arriving in [[Askole]], where his porters awaited, he came across [[Korphe]], a small village built on a shelf jutting out from a canyon.

To repay the remote community for their hospitality, Mortenson recounted in the book that he promised to build a school for the village.  After difficulties in raising capital, Mortenson was introduced to [[Jean Hoerni]], a Silicon Valley pioneer who donated the money that Mortenson needed for his school.  In the last months of his life, Hoerni co-founded the [[Central Asia Institute]], endowing the CAI to build schools in rural Pakistan and Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf \"Another Way to stop Terrorism\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023700/http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, ''Parade Magazine'', March 5, 2006.</ref>\n\nAccording to the book, Mortenson faced many daunting challenges in his quest to raise funds for the building of more than 55 schools in Taliban territory.

After getting lost during his descent, alone, he became weak and exhausted.  Instead of arriving in [[Askole]], where his porters awaited, he came across [[Korphe]], a small village built on a shelf jutting out from a canyon.

To repay the remote community for their hospitality, Mortenson recounted in the book that he promised to build a school for the village.  After difficulties in raising capital, Mortenson was introduced to [[Jean Hoerni]], a Silicon Valley pioneer who donated the money that Mortenson needed for his school.  In the last months of his life, Hoerni co-founded the [[Central Asia Institute]], endowing the CAI to build schools in rural Pakistan and Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf \"Another Way to stop Terrorism\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023700/http://www.gregmortenson.com/Articles/FeaturedArticles/03-05-06%20Parade%20Article.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, ''Parade Magazine'', March 5, 2006.</ref>\n\nAccording to the book, Mortenson faced many daunting challenges in his quest to raise funds for the building of more than 55 schools in Taliban territory.

Monetarist theory asserts that variations in the [[money supply]] have major influences on [[measures of national income and output|national output]] in the short run and on [[price level]]s over longer periods. Monetarists assert that the objectives of [[monetary policy]] are best met by targeting the growth rate of the [[money supply]] rather than by engaging in [[discretionary policy|discretionary monetary policy]].<ref name=\"Cagan\">[[Phillip Cagan]], 1987. \"Monetarism\", ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, Reprinted in John Eatwell et al.

Formulated by [[Milton Friedman]], it argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently [[inflation]]ary, and that monetary authorities should focus solely on maintaining [[price stability]].\n\nThis theory draws its roots from two historically antagonistic schools of thought: the hard money policies that dominated monetary thinking in the late 19th century, and the monetary theories of [[John Maynard Keynes]], who, working in the inter-war period during the failure of the restored [[gold standard]], proposed a demand-driven model for money.<ref>Mankiw, N. Gregory. \"Real Business Cycles: A New Keynesian Perspective\". Journal of Economic Perspectives 3.3 (1989): 79\u201390. Web.|date=October 2013</ref> While Keynes had focused on the stability of a currency's value, with panics based on an insufficient money supply leading to the use of an alternate currency and collapse of the monetary system, Friedman focused on price stability.\n\nThe result was summarised in a historical analysis of monetary policy, ''Monetary History of the United States 1867\u20131960'', which Friedman coauthored with [[Anna Schwartz]]. The book attributed inflation to excess money supply generated by a central bank. It attributed deflationary spirals to the reverse effect of a failure of a central bank to support the [[money supply]] during a [[liquidity]] crunch.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael D.|last=Bordo|date=1989|title=Money, History, & International Finance: Essays in Honor of Anna J.

Under this rule, there would be no leeway for the central reserve bank, as money supply increases could be determined \"by a computer\", and business could anticipate all money supply changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=59 |author=Thomas Palley |title=Milton Friedman: The Great Conservative Partisan |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Ip |authorlink= |author2=Whitehouse, Mark |title=How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116369744597625238 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher= |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate= }}</ref> With other monetarists he believed that the active manipulation of the money supply or its growth rate is more likely to destabilise than stabilise the economy.\n\n===Opposition to the gold standard===\nMost monetarists oppose the [[gold standard]]. Friedman, for example, viewed a pure gold standard as impractical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140436/http://fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp|url-status=dead|title=Monetary Central Planning and the State, Part 27: Milton Friedman's Second Thoughts on the Costs of Paper Money|archivedate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> For example, whereas one of the benefits of the gold standard is that the intrinsic limitations to the growth of the money supply by the use of gold would prevent inflation, if the growth of population or increase in trade outpaces the money supply, there would be no way to counteract deflation and reduced liquidity (and any attendant recession) except for the mining of more gold.\n\n==Rise==\n[[Clark Warburton]] is credited with making the first solid empirical case for the monetarist interpretation of [[business fluctuation]]s in a series of papers from 1945.<ref name=\"Cagan\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;493</sup> Within mainstream economics, the rise of monetarism accelerated from [[Milton Friedman]]'s 1956 restatement of the [[quantity theory of money]]. Friedman argued that the [[demand for money]] could be described as depending on a small number of economic variables.<ref name=\"hilbertcorporation\">{{cite journal |first=Milton |last=Friedman |year=1970 |title=A Theoretical Framework for Monetary Analysis |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=193\u2013238 [p. 210] |jstor=1830684 |doi=10.1086/259623}}</ref>\n\nThus, where the [[money supply]] expanded, people would not simply wish to hold the extra money in idle money balances; i.e., if they were in equilibrium before the increase, they were already holding money balances to suit their requirements, and thus after the increase they would have money balances surplus to their requirements. These excess money balances would therefore be spent and hence [[aggregate demand]] would rise. Similarly, if the money supply were reduced people would want to replenish their holdings of money by reducing their spending. In this, Friedman challenged a simplification attributed to Keynes suggesting that \"money does not matter.\"<ref name=\"hilbertcorporation\" /> Thus the word 'monetarist' was coined.\n\nThe rise of the popularity of monetarism also picked up in political circles when Keynesian economics seemed unable to explain or cure the seemingly contradictory problems of rising [[unemployment]] and [[inflation (economics)|inflation]] in response to the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1972 and the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shocks of 1973]]. On the one hand, higher unemployment seemed to call for Keynesian [[reflation]], but on the other hand rising inflation seemed to call for Keynesian [[disinflation (economics)|disinflation]].\n\nIn 1979, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed as Federal Reserve chief [[Paul Volcker]], who made fighting inflation his primary objective, and who restricted the money supply (in accordance with the [[Friedman rule]]) to tame inflation in the economy. The result was a major rise in interest rates, not only in the United States; but worldwide. The \"Volcker shock\" continued from 1979 to the summer of 1982, dramatically both decreasing inflation and increasing [[unemployment]]. Monetarist economists never recognized that the policy implemented by the Federal Reserve from 1979 was a monetarist policy. Nevertheless, the influence of monetarism on the Federal Reserve was twofold: a direct influence, by the adherence of some members of the Federal Open Market Committee to monetarist ideas; and an indirect influence, because monetarist views were taken into account in the determination of US monetary policy: even the members of the FOMC who were not monetarists took monetarist influence into strong consideration.<ref>Reichart Alexandre & Abdelkader Slifi (2016).

However, [[unemployment in the United Kingdom]] dramatically increased from 5.7% in 1979 to 12.2% in 1983, reaching 13.0% in 1982; and starting with the first quarter of 1980, the UK economy contracted in terms of real gross domestic product for six straight quarters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Real Gross Domestic Product for United Kingdom, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSAB1GQUK|accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Money_supply_during_the_great_depression_era.png|400px|thumb|right| Money supply decreased significantly between [[Black Tuesday]] and the [[Emergency Banking Act|Bank Holiday in March 1933]] in the wake of massive [[bank runs]] across the United States.]]\nMonetarists not only sought to explain present problems; they also interpreted historical ones. Milton Friedman and [[Anna Schwartz]] in their book ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960'' argued that the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was caused by a massive contraction of the money supply (they deemed it \"the [[Great Contraction]]\"<ref name=FriedmanSchwartz>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929\u20131933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13794-0}}</ref>), and not by the lack of investment Keynes had argued. They also maintained that post-war inflation was caused by an over-expansion of the money supply.\n\nThey made famous the assertion of monetarism that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\". Many Keynesian economists initially believed that the Keynesian vs. monetarist debate was solely about whether fiscal or [[monetary policy]] was the more effective tool of demand management. By the mid-1970s, however, the debate had moved on to other issues as monetarists began presenting a fundamental challenge to Keynesianism.\n\nMany monetarists sought to resurrect the pre-Keynesian view that market economies are inherently stable in the absence of major unexpected fluctuations in the money supply. Because of this belief in the stability of free-market economies they asserted that active demand management (e.g. by the means of increasing government spending) is unnecessary and indeed likely to be harmful. The basis of this argument is a relationship between \"stimulus\" fiscal spending and future interest rates. In effect, Friedman's model argues that current fiscal spending creates as much of a drag on the economy by increased interest rates as it creates present consumption: that it has no real effect on total demand, merely that of shifting demand from the investment sector to the consumer sector.\n\n==Current state==\n\nSince 1990, the classical form of monetarism has been questioned. This is because of events that many economists interpreted as being inexplicable in monetarist terms: the disconnection of the money supply growth from inflation in the 1990s and the failure of pure monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the 2001\u20132003 period. Former Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] argued that the 1990s decoupling was explained by a [[virtuous cycle]] of productivity and investment on one hand, and a certain degree of \"[[irrational exuberance]]\" in the investment sector on the other.\n\nThere are also arguments that monetarism is a special case of Keynesian theory. The central test case over the validity of these theories would be the possibility of a [[liquidity trap]], like that experienced by Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]], Princeton professor and another former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, argued that monetary policy could respond to zero interest rate conditions by direct expansion of the money supply. In his words, \"We have the keys to the printing press, and we are not afraid to use them.\"\n\nThese disagreements\u2014along with the role of monetary policies in trade liberalisation, international investment, and central bank policy\u2014remain lively topics of investigation and argument.\n\n==Notable proponents==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Karl Brunner (economist)|Karl Brunner]]\n* [[Phillip D.

Monetarist theory asserts that variations in the [[money supply]] have major influences on [[measures of national income and output|national output]] in the short run and on [[price level]]s over longer periods.

Formulated by [[Milton Friedman]], it argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently [[inflation]]ary, and that monetary authorities should focus solely on maintaining [[price stability]].\n\nThis theory draws its roots from two historically antagonistic schools of thought: the hard money policies that dominated monetary thinking in the late 19th century, and the monetary theories of [[John Maynard Keynes]], who, working in the inter-war period during the failure of the restored [[gold standard]], proposed a demand-driven model for money.<ref>Mankiw, N. Gregory. \"Real Business Cycles: A New Keynesian Perspective\". Journal of Economic Perspectives 3.3 (1989): 79\u201390. Web.|date=October 2013</ref> While Keynes had focused on the stability of a currency\u2019s value, with panics based on an insufficient money supply leading to the use of an alternate currency and collapse of the monetary system, Friedman focused on price stability.\n\nThe result was summarised in a historical analysis of monetary policy, ''Monetary History of the United States 1867\u20131960'', which Friedman coauthored with [[Anna Schwartz]]. The book attributed inflation to excess money supply generated by a central bank. It attributed deflationary spirals to the reverse effect of a failure of a central bank to support the [[money supply]] during a [[liquidity]] crunch.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael D.|last=Bordo|date=1989|title=Money, History, & International Finance: Essays in Honor of Anna J.

Under this rule, there would be no leeway for the central reserve bank, as money supply increases could be determined \"by a computer\", and business could anticipate all money supply changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=59 |author=Thomas Palley |title=Milton Friedman: The Great Conservative Partisan |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Ip |authorlink= |author2=Whitehouse, Mark |title=How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116369744597625238 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher= |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate= }}</ref> With other monetarists he believed that the active manipulation of the money supply or its growth rate is more likely to destabilise than stabilise the economy.\n\n===Opposition to the gold standard===\nMost monetarists oppose the [[gold standard]]. Friedman, for example, viewed a pure gold standard as impractical.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114140436/http://fff.org/freedom/0399b.asp|url-status=dead|title=Monetary Central Planning and the State, Part 27: Milton Friedman's Second Thoughts on the Costs of Paper Money|archivedate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> For example, whereas one of the benefits of the gold standard is that the intrinsic limitations to the growth of the money supply by the use of gold would prevent inflation, if the growth of population or increase in trade outpaces the money supply, there would be no way to counteract deflation and reduced liquidity (and any attendant recession) except for the mining of more gold.\n\n==Rise==\n[[Clark Warburton]] is credited with making the first solid empirical case for the monetarist interpretation of [[business fluctuation]]s in a series of papers from 1945.<ref name=\"Cagan\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;493</sup> Within mainstream economics, the rise of monetarism accelerated from [[Milton Friedman]]'s 1956 restatement of the [[quantity theory of money]]. Friedman argued that the [[demand for money]] could be described as depending on a small number of economic variables.<ref name=\"hilbertcorporation\">{{cite journal |first=Milton |last=Friedman |year=1970 |title=A Theoretical Framework for Monetary Analysis |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=193\u2013238 [p. 210] |jstor=1830684 |doi=10.1086/259623}}</ref>\n\nThus, where the [[money supply]] expanded, people would not simply wish to hold the extra money in idle money balances; i.e., if they were in equilibrium before the increase, they were already holding money balances to suit their requirements, and thus after the increase they would have money balances surplus to their requirements. These excess money balances would therefore be spent and hence [[aggregate demand]] would rise. Similarly, if the money supply were reduced people would want to replenish their holdings of money by reducing their spending. In this, Friedman challenged a simplification attributed to Keynes suggesting that \"money does not matter.\"<ref name=\"hilbertcorporation\" /> Thus the word 'monetarist' was coined.\n\nThe rise of the popularity of monetarism also picked up in political circles when Keynesian economics seemed unable to explain or cure the seemingly contradictory problems of rising [[unemployment]] and [[inflation (economics)|inflation]] in response to the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1972 and the [[1973 oil crisis|oil shocks of 1973]]. On the one hand, higher unemployment seemed to call for Keynesian [[reflation]], but on the other hand rising inflation seemed to call for Keynesian [[disinflation (economics)|disinflation]].\n\nIn 1979, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed as Federal Reserve chief [[Paul Volcker]], who made fighting inflation his primary objective, and who restricted the money supply (in accordance with the [[Friedman rule]]) to tame inflation in the economy. The result was a major rise in interest rates, not only in the United States; but worldwide. The \"Volcker shock\" continued from 1979 to the summer of 1982, dramatically both decreasing inflation and increasing [[unemployment]]. Monetarist economists never recognized that the policy implemented by the Federal Reserve from 1979 was a monetarist policy. Nevertheless, the influence of monetarism on the Federal Reserve was twofold: a direct influence, by the adherence of some members of the Federal Open Market Committee to monetarist ideas; and an indirect influence, because monetarist views were taken into account in the determination of US monetary policy: even the members of the FOMC who were not monetarists took monetarist influence into strong consideration.<ref>Reichart Alexandre & Abdelkader Slifi (2016).

However, [[unemployment in the United Kingdom]] dramatically increased from 5.7% in 1979 to 12.2% in 1983, reaching 13.0% in 1982; and starting with the first quarter of 1980, the UK economy contracted in terms of real gross domestic product for six straight quarters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Real Gross Domestic Product for United Kingdom, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSAB1GQUK|accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Money_supply_during_the_great_depression_era.png|400px|thumb|right| Money supply decreased significantly between [[Black Tuesday]] and the [[Emergency Banking Act|Bank Holiday in March 1933]] in the wake of massive [[bank runs]] across the United States.]]\nMonetarists not only sought to explain present problems; they also interpreted historical ones. Milton Friedman and [[Anna Schwartz]] in their book ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960'' argued that the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was caused by a massive contraction of the money supply (they deemed it \"the [[Great Contraction]]\"<ref name=FriedmanSchwartz>{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929\u20131933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13794-0}}</ref>), and not by the lack of investment Keynes had argued. They also maintained that post-war inflation was caused by an over-expansion of the money supply.\n\nThey made famous the assertion of monetarism that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\". Many Keynesian economists initially believed that the Keynesian vs. monetarist debate was solely about whether fiscal or [[monetary policy]] was the more effective tool of demand management. By the mid-1970s, however, the debate had moved on to other issues as monetarists began presenting a fundamental challenge to Keynesianism.\n\nMany monetarists sought to resurrect the pre-Keynesian view that market economies are inherently stable in the absence of major unexpected fluctuations in the money supply. Because of this belief in the stability of free-market economies they asserted that active demand management (e.g. by the means of increasing government spending) is unnecessary and indeed likely to be harmful. The basis of this argument is a relationship between \"stimulus\" fiscal spending and future interest rates. In effect, Friedman's model argues that current fiscal spending creates as much of a drag on the economy by increased interest rates as it creates present consumption: that it has no real effect on total demand, merely that of shifting demand from the investment sector to the consumer sector.\n\n==Current state==\n\nSince 1990, the classical form of monetarism has been questioned. This is because of events that many economists interpreted as being inexplicable in monetarist terms: the disconnection of the money supply growth from inflation in the 1990s and the failure of pure monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the 2001\u20132003 period. Former Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] argued that the 1990s decoupling was explained by a [[virtuous cycle]] of productivity and investment on one hand, and a certain degree of \"[[irrational exuberance]]\" in the investment sector on the other.\n\nThere are also arguments that monetarism is a special case of Keynesian theory. The central test case over the validity of these theories would be the possibility of a [[liquidity trap]], like that experienced by Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]], Princeton professor and another former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, argued that monetary policy could respond to zero interest rate conditions by direct expansion of the money supply. In his words, \"We have the keys to the printing press, and we are not afraid to use them.\"\n\nThese disagreements\u2014along with the role of monetary policies in trade liberalisation, international investment, and central bank policy\u2014remain lively topics of investigation and argument.\n\n==Notable proponents==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Karl Brunner (economist)|Karl Brunner]]\n* [[Phillip D.

whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\n[[Investopedia]] described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:\n\n<blockquote>[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you'll sell at $42.50.\n\nLet's assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 - $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being \"in the money.\"\n\nBut if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being \"out of the money.\"\n\nThe bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\nIn the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broker\u2019s Edge Calculator|url=https://www.binarytrading.com/brokers-edge-calculator/|website=BinaryTrading|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government [[financial regulation]], and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=2747|title=FMA Focus Binary Options and CFDs|publisher=[[Financial Market Authority (Austria)]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBinary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets. [[Gordon Pape]], writing in ''[[Forbes]]''.com in 2010, called binary options websites \"gambling sites, pure and simple\", and said \"this sort of thing can quickly become addictive... no one, no matter how knowledgeable, can consistently predict what a stock or commodity will do within a short time frame\".<ref name=\"Forbes\" />\n\nPape observed that binary options are poor from a gambling standpoint as well because of the excessive \"house edge\". One online binary options site paid $71 for each successful $100 trade. \"If you lose, you get back $15. Let's say you make 1,000 \"trades\" and win 545 of them. Your profit is $38,695.

Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.\nHence if we now take <math>r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}</math>, the foreign interest rate, <math>r_{DOM}</math>, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, we get the following results.\n\nIn case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}} T}\\Phi(d_2) \\,</math>\nIn case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}}T}\\Phi(-d_2) \\,</math>\nWhile in case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}} T}\\Phi(d_1) \\,</math>\nand in case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}T}\\Phi(-d_1) \\,</math>\n\n===Skew===\nIn the standard Black\u2013Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black\u2013Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the [[skewness]] of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset <math>\\sigma</math> across all strikes, incorporating a variable one <math>\\sigma(K)</math> where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the [[volatility skew]] into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.\n\nA binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, ''C'', at strike ''K'', as an infinitesimally tight spread, where <math>C_v</math> is a vanilla European call:<ref name=\"Breeden, D. T. 1978\"/><ref name=\"Gatheral, J. 2006\"/>\n:<math> C = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{C_v(K-\\epsilon) - C_v(K)}{\\epsilon} </math>\nThus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the [[derivative]] of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v}{dK} </math>\n\nWhen one takes volatility skew into account, <math>\\sigma</math> is a function of <math>K</math>:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v(K,\\sigma(K))}{dK} = -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} - \\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math>\n\nThe first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} = -\\frac{\\partial (S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2))}{\\partial K} = e^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2) = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}}</math>\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma}</math> is the [[Greeks (finance)|Vega]] of the vanilla call; <math>\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math> is sometimes called the \"skew slope\" or just \"skew\". Skew is typically negative, so the value of a binary call is higher when taking skew into account.\n:<math> C = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}} - \\mathrm{Vega}_v * \\mathrm{Skew}</math>\n\n===Relationship to vanilla options' Greeks===\nSince a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.\n\n==Regulation and fraud==\n{{further|Securities fraud}}\n\nMany binary option \"brokers\" have been exposed as fraudulent operations.<ref name=\"SEC1\"/> In those cases, there is no real [[brokerage]]; the customer is betting against the broker, who is acting as a [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shop]].

whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\n[[Investopedia]] described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:\n\n<blockquote>[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you'll sell at $42.50.\n\nLet's assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 - $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being \"in the money.\"\n\nBut if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being \"out of the money.\"\n\nThe bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\nIn the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broker\u2019s Edge Calculator|url=https://www.binarytrading.com/brokers-edge-calculator/|website=BinaryTrading|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government [[financial regulation]], and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=2747|title=FMA Focus Binary Options and CFDs|publisher=[[Financial Market Authority (Austria)]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBinary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets.

One online binary options site paid $71 for each successful $100 trade. \"If you lose, you get back $15. Let's say you make 1,000 \"trades\" and win 545 of them. Your profit is $38,695.

Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.\nHence if we now take <math>r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}</math>, the foreign interest rate, <math>r_{DOM}</math>, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, we get the following results.\n\nIn case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}} T}\\Phi(d_2) \\,</math>\nIn case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}}T}\\Phi(-d_2) \\,</math>\nWhile in case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}} T}\\Phi(d_1) \\,</math>\nand in case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}T}\\Phi(-d_1) \\,</math>\n\n===Skew===\nIn the standard Black\u2013Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black\u2013Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the [[skewness]] of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset <math>\\sigma</math> across all strikes, incorporating a variable one <math>\\sigma(K)</math> where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the [[volatility skew]] into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.\n\nA binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, ''C'', at strike ''K'', as an infinitesimally tight spread, where <math>C_v</math> is a vanilla European call:<ref name=\"Breeden, D. T. 1978\"/><ref name=\"Gatheral, J. 2006\"/>\n:<math> C = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{C_v(K-\\epsilon) - C_v(K)}{\\epsilon} </math>\nThus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the [[derivative]] of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v}{dK} </math>\n\nWhen one takes volatility skew into account, <math>\\sigma</math> is a function of <math>K</math>:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v(K,\\sigma(K))}{dK} = -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} - \\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math>\n\nThe first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} = -\\frac{\\partial (S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2))}{\\partial K} = e^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2) = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}}</math>\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma}</math> is the [[Greeks (finance)|Vega]] of the vanilla call; <math>\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math> is sometimes called the \"skew slope\" or just \"skew\".

{"title_page": "Security (finance)", "text_new": "{{about|the negotiable instrument|the legal right given to a creditor by a debtor|Security interest}}\n{{Securities}}\n{{Financial markets}}\nA '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]]. The term commonly refers to any form of [[financial instrument]], but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages the term \"security\" is commonly used in day-to-day parlance to mean any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than [[Stock|equities]] and fixed income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., [[Warrant (finance)|equity warrants]].\n\nSecurities may be represented by a certificate or, more typically, \"non-certificated\", that is in electronic ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) or \"[[book entry]]\" only form. Certificates may be ''bearer'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights under the security merely by holding the security, or ''registered'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if he or she appears on a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They include shares of corporate [[stock]] or [[mutual fund]]s, [[bond (finance)|bond]]s issued by corporations or governmental agencies, [[stock option]]s or other options, limited partnership units, and various other formal investment instruments that are negotiable and fungible.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the national [[competent authority]] for financial markets regulation is the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]; the definition in its Handbook of the term \"security\"<ref>{{Citation | url=https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G1061.html | title=security | work=FCA Handbook | publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]] | accessdate=2016-11-11}}</ref> applies only to equities, [[debenture]]s, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, rights to or interests in investments, and anything that may be admitted to the Official List.\n\nIn the United States, a '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]] of any kind.<ref>The United States [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] defines a security as: \"Any [[Note (finance)|note]], [[stock]], [[treasury stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], [[debenture]], certificate of interest or participation in any [[profit-sharing agreement]] or in any oil, gas, or other mineral [[royalties|royalty]] or [[lease]], any [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] [[Trust certificate (finance)|trust certificate]], preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, [[investment]] [[contract]], voting-trust certificate, [[certificate of deposit]], for a security, any [[put option|put]], [[call option|call]], [[straddle]], [[option (finance)|option]], or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national [[Exchange (organized market)|securities exchange]] relating to [[Currency|foreign currency]], or in general, any [[Financial instrument|instrument]] commonly known as a \"security\"; or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, [[bill of exchange]], or banker's acceptance which has a [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.\"</ref> Securities are broadly categorized into:\n* [[debt securities]] (e.g., [[banknote]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[debenture]]s)\n* [[Stock|equity securities]] (e.g., [[common stock]]s)\n* [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s (e.g., [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]]).\n\nThe company or other entity issuing the security is called the [[issuer]]. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, private investment pools may have some features of securities, but they may not be registered or regulated as such if they meet various restrictions.\n\nSecurities are the traditional way that commercial enterprises raise new capital. These may be an attractive alternative to bank loans depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. Another disadvantage of bank loans as a source of financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may issue securities too when it needs to increase [[government debt]].\n\n== Debt and equity ==\nSecurities are traditionally divided into debt securities and equities (see also [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]).\n\n=== Debt ===\nDebt securities may be called [[debenture]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]], [[Promissory note|notes]] or [[commercial paper]] depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights under the terms of the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually \"senior\" to other [[unsecured debt]] meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is \"subordinated\".\n\n'''[[Corporate bond]]s''' represent the debt of commercial or industrial entities. Debentures have a long maturity, typically at least ten years, whereas notes have a shorter maturity. Commercial paper is a simple form of debt security that essentially represents a post-dated cheque with a maturity of not more than 270 days.\n\n'''Money market instruments''' are short term debt instruments that may have characteristics of deposit accounts, such as [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]], [[Accelerated Return Notes (ARN)]], and certain [[bill of exchange|bills of exchange]]. They are highly liquid and are sometimes referred to as \"near cash\". Commercial paper is also often highly liquid.\n\n'''Euro debt securities''' are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination different from that of the issuer's domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A euronote may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.\n\n'''Government bonds''' are medium or long term debt securities issued by sovereign governments or their agencies. Typically they carry a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds, and serve as a source of finance for governments. U.S. federal government bonds are called ''treasuries.'' Because of their liquidity and perceived low risk, treasuries are used to manage the money supply in the [[open market operation]]s of non-US central banks.\n\n'''Sub-sovereign government bonds''', known in the U.S. as [[municipal bond]]s, represent the debt of state, provincial, territorial, municipal or other governmental units other than sovereign governments.\n\n'''Supranational bonds''' represent the debt of international organizations such as the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, the [[International Monetary Fund]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, regional [[multilateral development banks]]{{vague|date=April 2017}} and others.\n\n=== Equity ===\nAn equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and [[capital gain]], whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of [[Debt|principal]] regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the \"upside\" of the business and to control the business.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nHybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.\n\n'''Preference shares''' form an intermediate class of security between equities and debt. If the issuer is liquidated, they carry the right to receive interest or a return of capital in priority to ordinary shareholders. However, from a legal perspective, they are capital stock and therefore may entitle holders to some degree of control depending on whether they contain voting rights.\n\n'''Convertibles''' are bonds or [[preferred stock]] that can be converted, at the election of the holder of the convertibles, into the common stock of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a [[callable bond]], and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about 1 month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.\n\n'''Equity warrants''' are options issued by the company that allow the holder of the warrant to purchase a specific number of shares at a specified price within a specified time. They are often issued together with bonds or existing equities, and are, sometimes, detachable from them and separately tradeable. When the holder of the warrant exercises it, he pays the money directly to the company, and the company issues new shares to the holder.\n\nWarrants, like other convertible securities, increases the number of shares outstanding, and are always accounted for in financial reports as fully diluted earnings per share, which assumes that all warrants and convertibles will be exercised.\n\n== Classification ==\nSecurities may be classified according to many categories or classification systems:\n* [[Denomination (currency)|Currency of denomination]]\n* [[Title (property)|Ownership rights]]\n* Terms to maturity\n* Degree of liquidity\n* [[Income|Income payments]]\n* Tax treatment\n* [[Credit rating]]\n* Industrial sector or \"[[industry]]\". (\"Sector\" often refers to a higher level or broader category, such as ''Consumer Discretionary'', whereas \"industry\" often refers to a lower level classification, such as ''Consumer Appliances''. See [[Industry]] for a discussion of some classification systems.)\n* Region or country (such as country of incorporation, country of principal sales/market of its products or services, or country in which the principal securities exchange where it trades is located)\n* [[Market capitalization]]\n* State (typically for municipal or \"tax-free\" bonds in the US)\n\n== Type of holder ==\nInvestors in securities may be [[retail]], i.e., members of the public investing other than by way of business. The greatest part of investment, in terms of volume, is [[wholesale]], i.e., by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients. Important [[institutional investor]]s include [[investment bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and other managed funds.\n\n== Investment ==\nThe traditional economic function of the purchase of securities is investment, with the view to receiving [[income]] or achieving [[capital gain]]. Debt securities generally offer a higher rate of interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. [[Equity (finance)|Equity investment]] may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing 'restructuring'. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.\n\n== Collateral ==\nThe last decade has seen an enormous growth in the use of securities as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called \"[[buying on margin]]\". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver [[property right]]s in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes [[insolvent]]. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely [[security interest]]s and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as [[mutual fund]]s are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in [[securities lending]] scenarios.\n\nOn the consumer level, loans against securities have grown into three distinct groups over the last decade: '''1)''' ''Standard Institutional Loans,'' generally offering low loan-to-value with very strict call and coverage regimens, akin to standard margin loans; '''2)''' ''Transfer-of-Title (ToT) Loans,'' typically provided by private parties where borrower ownership is completely extinguished save for the rights provided in the loan contract; and '''3)''' Non-Transfer-of-Title Credit Line facilities where shares are not sold and they serve as assets in a standard lien-type line of cash credit. Of the three, transfer-of-title loans have fallen into the very high-risk category as the number of providers has dwindled as regulators have launched an industry-wide crackdown on transfer-of-title structures where the private lender may sell or [[short (finance)|sell short]] the securities to fund the loan. Institutionally managed consumer securities-based loans on the other hand, draw loan funds from the financial resources of the lending institution, not from the sale of the securities.\n\nCollateral and sources of collateral are changing, in 2012 gold became a more acceptable form of collateral.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CME Clearing Europe collateral types to include gold bullion {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=218278#.VnKTfntapFR|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}</ref> However more recently Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seen by many as the ugly ducklings of the collateral world have started to become more readily available and acceptable.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Markit makes its ETF mark with big market players {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=220267#.VnKTF3tapFQ|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}</ref> But in a world where collateral is becoming scarce and efficiency is everything, many of these mallards are proving themselves to be not so ugly after all\u2014many more are veritable swans. The problem, until now, for collateral managers has been deciphering the bad eggs from the good, which proves to be a time-consuming and inefficient task.\n\n== Markets ==\n\n=== Primary and secondary market ===\nPublic securities markets are either primary or secondary markets. In the primary market, the money for the securities is received by the issuer of the securities from investors, typically in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). In the secondary market, the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor, with the money going from one investor to the other.\n\nAn initial public offering is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an \"IPO\" for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, but they are not considered to be an IPO but are often called a \"secondary offering\". Issuers usually retain [[investment bank]]s to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining SEC (or other regulatory body) approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a [[firm commitment underwriting]]. However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a [[best effort agreement]], where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.\n\nFor the primary market to thrive, there must be a [[secondary market]], or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security\u2014where holders of securities can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets.\n\nIn Europe, the [[principal trade]] organization for securities dealers is the International Capital Market Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icma-group.org/ |title=icma-group.org |publisher=icma-group.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> In the U.S., the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sifma.org/ |title=sifma.org |publisher=sifma.org |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> which is the result of the merger of the Securities Industry Association and the Bond Market Association. The Financial Information Services Division of the Software and Information Industry Association (FISD/SIIA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisd.net |title=fisd.net |publisher=fisd.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> represents a round-table of market data industry firms, referring to them as Consumers, Exchanges, and Vendors. In India the equivalent organisation is the securities exchange board of India (SEBI).\n\n=== Public offer and private placement ===\nIn the primary markets, securities may be offered to the public in a [[public offer]]. Alternatively, they may be offered privately to a limited number of qualified persons in a [[private placement]]. Sometimes a combination of the two is used. The distinction between the two is important to securities regulation and [[company law]]. Privately placed securities are not publicly tradable and may only be bought and sold by sophisticated qualified investors. As a result, the secondary market is not nearly as liquid as it is for public (registered) securities.\n\nAnother category, [[sovereign bond]]s, is generally sold by auction to a specialized class of dealers.\n\n=== Listing and over-the-counter dealing ===\nSecurities are often listed in a [[stock exchange]], an organized and officially recognized market on which securities can be bought and sold. Issuers may seek listings for their securities to attract investors, by ensuring there is a liquid and regulated market that investors can buy and sell securities in.\n\nGrowth in informal electronic trading systems has challenged the traditional business of stock exchanges. Large volumes of securities are also bought and sold \"over the counter\" (OTC). OTC dealing involves buyers and sellers dealing with each other by telephone or electronically on the basis of prices that are displayed electronically, usually by [[financial data vendor]]s such as SuperDerivatives, [[Reuters]], [[Investing.com]] and [[Bloomberg Terminal|Bloomberg]].\n\nThere are also eurosecurities, which are securities that are issued outside their domestic market into more than one jurisdiction. They are generally listed on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]] or admitted to listing in [[London]]. The reasons for listing eurobonds include regulatory and tax considerations, as well as the investment restrictions.\n\n=== Market ===\nLondon is the centre of the eurosecurities markets. There was a huge rise in the eurosecurities market in London in the early 1980s. Settlement of trades in eurosecurities is currently effected through two European computerized clearing/depositories called [[Euroclear]] (in Belgium) and [[Clearstream]] (formerly Cedelbank) in Luxembourg.\n\nThe main market for Eurobonds is the EuroMTS, owned by Borsa Italiana and Euronext. There are ramp up market in Emergent countries, but it is growing slowly.\n\n== Physical nature ==\n\n=== Certificated securities ===\nSecurities that are represented in paper (physical) form are called certificated securities. They may be ''bearer'' or ''registered''.\n\n=== DRS securities ===\nSecurities may also be held in the Direct Registration System (DRS), which is a method of recording shares of stock in book-entry form. Book-entry means the company's transfer agent maintains the shares on the owner's behalf without the need for physical share certificates. Shares held in un-certificated book-entry form have the same rights and privileges as shares held in certificated form.\n\n==== Bearer securities ====\n[[File:1969 $100K Treasury Bill (front).jpg|thumb|1969 $100,000 Treasury Bill|417x417px]]\nBearer securities are completely negotiable and entitle the holder to the rights under the security (e.g., to payment if it is a debt security, and voting if it is an equity security). They are transferred by delivering the instrument from person to person. In some cases, transfer is by endorsement, or signing the back of the instrument, and delivery.\n\nRegulatory and fiscal authorities sometimes regard bearer securities negatively, as they may be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the issue of bearer securities was heavily restricted firstly by the ''Exchange Control Act'' 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.\n\nIn Luxembourg, the law of 28 July 2014 concerning the compulsory deposit and immobilization of shares and units in bearer form adopts the compulsory deposit and immobilization of bearer shares and units with a depositary allowing identification of the holders thereof.\n\n==== Registered securities ====\n[[File:1981 $10k 15.875% Registered Note .jpg|thumb|1981 $10,000 15.875% Registered Note]]\nIn the case of registered securities, certificates bearing the name of the holder are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person does not automatically acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details of the holder of the securities are entered and updated as appropriate. A transfer of registered securities is effected by amending the register.\n\n=== Non-certificated securities and global certificates ===\nModern practice has developed to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. There are two general ways this has been accomplished.\n\n==== Non-certificated securities ====\nIn some jurisdictions, such as France, it is possible for issuers of that jurisdiction to maintain a legal record of their securities electronically.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the current \"official\" version of Article 8 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] permits non-certificated securities. However, the \"official\" UCC is a mere draft that must be enacted individually by each [[U.S. state]]. Though all 50 states (as well as the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) have enacted some form of Article 8, many of them still appear to use older versions of Article 8, including some that did not permit non-certificated securities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/ucc.html#a8 |title=LII: UCC - Locator |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2012-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==== Global certificates, book entry interests, depositories ====\nTo facilitate the electronic transfer of interests in securities without dealing with inconsistent versions of Article 8, a system has developed whereby issuers deposit a single global certificate representing all the outstanding securities of a class or series with a universal depository. This depository is called [[The Depository Trust Company]], or DTC. DTC's parent, [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities on behalf of all the DTC participants.\n\nAll securities traded through DTC are in fact held, in electronic form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g., a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at local broker Jones & Co. brokers. In turn, Jones & Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones & Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones & Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books for the benefit of customers like Jones & Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called [[beneficial ownership]]. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in \"Street name\".\n\nAmong brokerages and mutual fund companies, a large amount of mutual fund share transactions take place among intermediaries as opposed to shares being sold and redeemed directly with the transfer agent of the fund. Most of these intermediaries such as brokerage firms clear the shares electronically through the National Securities Clearing Corp. or \"NSCC\", a subsidiary of DTCC.\n\n==== Other depositories ====\nBesides DTC, two other large securities depositories exist, both in Europe: Euroclear and Clearstream.\n\n=== Divided and undivided security ===\nThe terms \"divided\" and \"undivided\" relate to the proprietary nature of a security.\n\nEach divided security constitutes a separate asset, which is legally distinct from each other security in the same issue. Pre-electronic bearer securities were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.\n\nWith undivided securities, the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each of the securities being a fractional part of this undivided whole. Shares in the secondary markets are always undivided. The issuer owes only one set of obligations to shareholders under its memorandum, articles of association and company law. A [[share (finance)|share]] represents an undivided fractional part of the issuing company. Registered debt securities also have this undivided nature.\n\n=== Fungible and non-fungible securities ===\nIn a non-[[Fungibility|fungible]] security, certain characteristics of the owner are checked for when they use a feature of the security and affects how they can use that feature. For example, a bond may have a different maturation date depending on what countries its owner is a citizen of. \n\nIn a fungible security, the rules of the security aren't affected by judgement made about the owner.\n\n== Regulation ==\nIn the US, the public offer and sale of securities must be either registered pursuant to a registration statement that is filed with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) or are offered and sold pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Dealing in securities is regulated by both federal authorities (SEC) and state securities departments. In addition, the brokerage industry is supposedly self policed by Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs), such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (or NASD) or the MSRB.\n\nWith respect to investment schemes that do not fall within the traditional categories of securities listed in the definition of a security (Sec. 2(a)(1) of the 33 act and Sec. 3(a)(10) of the 34 act) the US Courts have developed a broad definition for securities that must then be registered with the SEC. When determining if there is an \"investment contract\" that must be registered the courts look for an investment of money, a common enterprise and expectation of profits to come primarily from the efforts of others.

Howey Co.]]''\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Commercial law]]\n* [[Finance]]\n* [[Financial market]]\n* [[Financial regulation]]\n* [[History of private equity and venture capital]]\n* [[Interest in securities]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n* [[Securities analyst]]\n* [[Securities lending]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Settlement (finance)]]\n* [[Single-stock futures]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n* [[T2S]]\n* [[Toxic security]]\n* [[Trading account assets]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking}}\n{{hedge funds}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Security (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Securities (finance)| ]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the negotiable instrument|the legal right given to a creditor by a debtor|Security interest}}\n{{Securities}}\n{{Financial markets}}\nA '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]]. The term commonly refers to any form of [[financial instrument]], but its legal definition varies by jurisdiction. In some countries and languages the term \"security\" is commonly used in day-to-day parlance to mean any form of financial instrument, even though the underlying legal and regulatory regime may not have such a broad definition. In some jurisdictions the term specifically excludes financial instruments other than [[Stock|equities]] and fixed income instruments. In some jurisdictions it includes some instruments that are close to equities and fixed income, e.g., [[Warrant (finance)|equity warrants]].\n\nSecurities may be represented by a certificate or, more typically, \"non-certificated\", that is in electronic ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) or \"[[book entry]]\" only form. Certificates may be ''bearer'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights under the security merely by holding the security, or ''registered'', meaning they entitle the holder to rights only if he or she appears on a security register maintained by the issuer or an intermediary. They include shares of corporate [[stock]] or [[mutual fund]]s, [[bond (finance)|bond]]s issued by corporations or governmental agencies, [[stock option]]s or other options, limited partnership units, and various other formal investment instruments that are negotiable and fungible.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the national [[competent authority]] for financial markets regulation is the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]; the definition in its Handbook of the term \"security\"<ref>{{Citation | url=https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G1061.html | title=security | work=FCA Handbook | publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]] | accessdate=2016-11-11}}</ref> applies only to equities, [[debenture]]s, alternative debentures, government and public securities, warrants, certificates representing certain securities, units, stakeholder pension schemes, personal pension schemes, rights to or interests in investments, and anything that may be admitted to the Official List.\n\nIn the United States, a '''security''' is a tradable [[financial asset]] of any kind.<ref>The United States [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] defines a security as: \"Any [[Note (finance)|note]], [[stock]], [[treasury stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], [[debenture]], certificate of interest or participation in any [[profit-sharing agreement]] or in any oil, gas, or other mineral [[royalties|royalty]] or [[lease]], any [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] [[Trust certificate (finance)|trust certificate]], preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, [[investment]] [[contract]], voting-trust certificate, [[certificate of deposit]], for a security, any [[put option|put]], [[call option|call]], [[straddle]], [[option (finance)|option]], or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national [[Exchange (organized market)|securities exchange]] relating to [[Currency|foreign currency]], or in general, any [[Financial instrument|instrument]] commonly known as a \"security\"; or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, [[bill of exchange]], or banker's acceptance which has a [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.\"</ref> Securities are broadly categorized into:\n* [[debt securities]] (e.g., [[banknote]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[debenture]]s)\n* [[Stock|equity securities]] (e.g., [[common stock]]s)\n* [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s (e.g., [[Forward contract|forwards]], [[futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]]).\n\nThe company or other entity issuing the security is called the [[issuer]]. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security. For example, private investment pools may have some features of securities, but they may not be registered or regulated as such if they meet various restrictions.\n\nSecurities are the traditional way that commercial enterprises raise new capital. These may be an attractive alternative to bank loans depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. Another disadvantage of bank loans as a source of financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may issue securities too when it needs to increase [[government debt]].\n\n== Debt and equity ==\nSecurities are traditionally divided into debt securities and equities (see also [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]).\n\n=== Debt ===\nDebt securities may be called [[debenture]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]], [[Promissory note|notes]] or [[commercial paper]] depending on their maturity, collateral and other characteristics. The holder of a debt security is typically entitled to the payment of principal and interest, together with other contractual rights under the terms of the issue, such as the right to receive certain information. Debt securities are generally issued for a fixed term and redeemable by the issuer at the end of that term. Debt securities may be protected by collateral or may be unsecured, and, if they are unsecured, may be contractually \"senior\" to other [[unsecured debt]] meaning their holders would have a priority in a bankruptcy of the issuer. Debt that is not senior is \"subordinated\".\n\n'''[[Corporate bond]]s''' represent the debt of commercial or industrial entities. Debentures have a long maturity, typically at least ten years, whereas notes have a shorter maturity. Commercial paper is a simple form of debt security that essentially represents a post-dated cheque with a maturity of not more than 270 days.\n\n'''Money market instruments''' are short term debt instruments that may have characteristics of deposit accounts, such as [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]], [[Accelerated Return Notes (ARN)]], and certain [[bill of exchange|bills of exchange]]. They are highly liquid and are sometimes referred to as \"near cash\". Commercial paper is also often highly liquid.\n\n'''Euro debt securities''' are securities issued internationally outside their domestic market in a denomination different from that of the issuer's domicile. They include eurobonds and euronotes. Eurobonds are characteristically underwritten, and not secured, and interest is paid gross. A euronote may take the form of euro-commercial paper (ECP) or euro-certificates of deposit.\n\n'''Government bonds''' are medium or long term debt securities issued by sovereign governments or their agencies. Typically they carry a lower rate of interest than corporate bonds, and serve as a source of finance for governments. U.S. federal government bonds are called ''treasuries.'' Because of their liquidity and perceived low risk, treasuries are used to manage the money supply in the [[open market operation]]s of non-US central banks.\n\n'''Sub-sovereign government bonds''', known in the U.S. as [[municipal bond]]s, represent the debt of state, provincial, territorial, municipal or other governmental units other than sovereign governments.\n\n'''Supranational bonds''' represent the debt of international organizations such as the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, the [[International Monetary Fund]]{{fact|date=April 2017}}, regional [[multilateral development banks]]{{vague|date=April 2017}} and others.\n\n=== Equity ===\nAn equity security is a share of equity interest in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form of equity interest is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder of an equity is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority of the equity is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and [[capital gain]], whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of [[Debt|principal]] regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the \"upside\" of the business and to control the business.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nHybrid securities combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.\n\n'''Preference shares''' form an intermediate class of security between equities and debt. If the issuer is liquidated, they carry the right to receive interest or a return of capital in priority to ordinary shareholders. However, from a legal perspective, they are capital stock and therefore may entitle holders to some degree of control depending on whether they contain voting rights.\n\n'''Convertibles''' are bonds or [[preferred stock]] that can be converted, at the election of the holder of the convertibles, into the common stock of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a [[callable bond]], and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about 1 month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.\n\n'''Equity warrants''' are options issued by the company that allow the holder of the warrant to purchase a specific number of shares at a specified price within a specified time. They are often issued together with bonds or existing equities, and are, sometimes, detachable from them and separately tradeable. When the holder of the warrant exercises it, he pays the money directly to the company, and the company issues new shares to the holder.\n\nWarrants, like other convertible securities, increases the number of shares outstanding, and are always accounted for in financial reports as fully diluted earnings per share, which assumes that all warrants and convertibles will be exercised.\n\n== Classification ==\nSecurities may be classified according to many categories or classification systems:\n* [[Denomination (currency)|Currency of denomination]]\n* [[Title (property)|Ownership rights]]\n* Terms to maturity\n* Degree of liquidity\n* [[Income|Income payments]]\n* Tax treatment\n* [[Credit rating]]\n* Industrial sector or \"[[industry]]\". (\"Sector\" often refers to a higher level or broader category, such as ''Consumer Discretionary'', whereas \"industry\" often refers to a lower level classification, such as ''Consumer Appliances''. See [[Industry]] for a discussion of some classification systems.)\n* Region or country (such as country of incorporation, country of principal sales/market of its products or services, or country in which the principal securities exchange where it trades is located)\n* [[Market capitalization]]\n* State (typically for municipal or \"tax-free\" bonds in the US)\n\n== Type of holder ==\nInvestors in securities may be [[retail]], i.e., members of the public investing other than by way of business. The greatest part of investment, in terms of volume, is [[wholesale]], i.e., by financial institutions acting on their own account, or on behalf of clients. Important [[institutional investor]]s include [[investment bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and other managed funds.\n\n== Investment ==\nThe traditional economic function of the purchase of securities is investment, with the view to receiving [[income]] or achieving [[capital gain]]. Debt securities generally offer a higher rate of interest than bank deposits, and equities may offer the prospect of capital growth. [[Equity (finance)|Equity investment]] may also offer control of the business of the issuer. Debt holdings may also offer some measure of control to the investor if the company is a fledgling start-up or an old giant undergoing 'restructuring'. In these cases, if interest payments are missed, the creditors may take control of the company and liquidate it to recover some of their investment.\n\n== Collateral ==\nThe last decade has seen an enormous growth in the use of securities as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called \"[[buying on margin]]\". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver [[property right]]s in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes [[insolvent]]. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely [[security interest]]s and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as [[mutual fund]]s are significant collateral takers as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in [[securities lending]] scenarios.\n\nOn the consumer level, loans against securities have grown into three distinct groups over the last decade: '''1)''' ''Standard Institutional Loans,'' generally offering low loan-to-value with very strict call and coverage regimens, akin to standard margin loans; '''2)''' ''Transfer-of-Title (ToT) Loans,'' typically provided by private parties where borrower ownership is completely extinguished save for the rights provided in the loan contract; and '''3)''' Non-Transfer-of-Title Credit Line facilities where shares are not sold and they serve as assets in a standard lien-type line of cash credit. Of the three, transfer-of-title loans have fallen into the very high-risk category as the number of providers has dwindled as regulators have launched an industry-wide crackdown on transfer-of-title structures where the private lender may sell or [[short (finance)|sell short]] the securities to fund the loan. Institutionally managed consumer securities-based loans on the other hand, draw loan funds from the financial resources of the lending institution, not from the sale of the securities.\n\nCollateral and sources of collateral are changing, in 2012 gold became a more acceptable form of collateral.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CME Clearing Europe collateral types to include gold bullion {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=218278#.VnKTfntapFR|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}</ref> However more recently Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seen by many as the ugly ducklings of the collateral world have started to become more readily available and acceptable.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Markit makes its ETF mark with big market players {{!}} Securities Lending Times news {{!}} securitieslendingtimes.com|url = http://www.securitieslendingtimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=220267#.VnKTF3tapFQ|website = www.securitieslendingtimes.com|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}</ref> But in a world where collateral is becoming scarce and efficiency is everything, many of these mallards are proving themselves to be not so ugly after all\u2014many more are veritable swans. The problem, until now, for collateral managers has been deciphering the bad eggs from the good, which proves to be a time consuming and inefficient task.\n\n== Markets ==\n\n=== Primary and secondary market ===\nPublic securities markets are either primary or secondary markets. In the primary market, the money for the securities is received by the issuer of the securities from investors, typically in an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). In the secondary market, the securities are simply assets held by one investor selling them to another investor, with the money going from one investor to the other.\n\nAn initial public offering is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an \"IPO\" for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, but they are not considered to be an IPO but are often called a \"secondary offering\". Issuers usually retain [[investment bank]]s to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining SEC (or other regulatory body) approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a [[firm commitment underwriting]]. However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a [[best effort agreement]], where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.\n\nFor the primary market to thrive, there must be a [[secondary market]], or aftermarket that provides liquidity for the investment security\u2014where holders of securities can sell them to other investors for cash. Otherwise, few people would purchase primary issues, and, thus, companies and governments would be restricted in raising equity capital (money) for their operations. Organized exchanges constitute the main secondary markets. Many smaller issues and most debt securities trade in the decentralized, dealer-based [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets.\n\nIn Europe, the [[principal trade]] organization for securities dealers is the International Capital Market Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icma-group.org/ |title=icma-group.org |publisher=icma-group.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> In the U.S., the principal trade organization for securities dealers is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sifma.org/ |title=sifma.org |publisher=sifma.org |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> which is the result of the merger of the Securities Industry Association and the Bond Market Association. The Financial Information Services Division of the Software and Information Industry Association (FISD/SIIA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisd.net |title=fisd.net |publisher=fisd.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> represents a round-table of market data industry firms, referring to them as Consumers, Exchanges, and Vendors. In India the equivalent organisation is the securities exchange board of India (SEBI).\n\n=== Public offer and private placement ===\nIn the primary markets, securities may be offered to the public in a [[public offer]]. Alternatively, they may be offered privately to a limited number of qualified persons in a [[private placement]]. Sometimes a combination of the two is used. The distinction between the two is important to securities regulation and [[company law]]. Privately placed securities are not publicly tradable and may only be bought and sold by sophisticated qualified investors. As a result, the secondary market is not nearly as liquid as it is for public (registered) securities.\n\nAnother category, [[sovereign bond]]s, is generally sold by auction to a specialized class of dealers.\n\n=== Listing and over-the-counter dealing ===\nSecurities are often listed in a [[stock exchange]], an organized and officially recognized market on which securities can be bought and sold. Issuers may seek listings for their securities to attract investors, by ensuring there is a liquid and regulated market that investors can buy and sell securities in.\n\nGrowth in informal electronic trading systems has challenged the traditional business of stock exchanges. Large volumes of securities are also bought and sold \"over the counter\" (OTC). OTC dealing involves buyers and sellers dealing with each other by telephone or electronically on the basis of prices that are displayed electronically, usually by [[financial data vendor]]s such as SuperDerivatives, [[Reuters]], [[Investing.com]] and [[Bloomberg Terminal|Bloomberg]].\n\nThere are also eurosecurities, which are securities that are issued outside their domestic market into more than one jurisdiction. They are generally listed on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]] or admitted to listing in [[London]]. The reasons for listing eurobonds include regulatory and tax considerations, as well as the investment restrictions.\n\n=== Market ===\nLondon is the centre of the eurosecurities markets. There was a huge rise in the eurosecurities market in London in the early 1980s. Settlement of trades in eurosecurities is currently effected through two European computerized clearing/depositories called [[Euroclear]] (in Belgium) and [[Clearstream]] (formerly Cedelbank) in Luxembourg.\n\nThe main market for Eurobonds is the EuroMTS, owned by Borsa Italiana and Euronext. There are ramp up market in Emergent countries, but it is growing slowly.\n\n== Physical nature ==\n\n=== Certificated securities ===\nSecurities that are represented in paper (physical) form are called certificated securities. They may be ''bearer'' or ''registered''.\n\n=== DRS securities ===\nSecurities may also be held in the Direct Registration System (DRS), which is a method of recording shares of stock in book-entry form. Book-entry means the company's transfer agent maintains the shares on the owner's behalf without the need for physical share certificates. Shares held in un-certificated book-entry form have the same rights and privileges as shares held in certificated form.\n\n==== Bearer securities ====\n[[File:1969 $100K Treasury Bill (front).jpg|thumb|1969 $100,000 Treasury Bill|417x417px]]\nBearer securities are completely negotiable and entitle the holder to the rights under the security (e.g., to payment if it is a debt security, and voting if it is an equity security). They are transferred by delivering the instrument from person to person. In some cases, transfer is by endorsement, or signing the back of the instrument, and delivery.\n\nRegulatory and fiscal authorities sometimes regard bearer securities negatively, as they may be used to facilitate the evasion of regulatory restrictions and tax. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, the issue of bearer securities was heavily restricted firstly by the ''Exchange Control Act'' 1947 until 1953. Bearer securities are very rare in the United States because of the negative tax implications they may have to the issuer and holder.\n\nIn Luxembourg, the law of 28 July 2014 concerning the compulsory deposit and immobilization of shares and units in bearer form adopts the compulsory deposit and immobilization of bearer shares and units with a depositary allowing identification of the holders thereof.\n\n==== Registered securities ====\n[[File:1981 $10k 15.875% Registered Note .jpg|thumb|1981 $10,000 15.875% Registered Note]]\nIn the case of registered securities, certificates bearing the name of the holder are issued, but these merely represent the securities. A person does not automatically acquire legal ownership by having possession of the certificate. Instead, the issuer (or its appointed agent) maintains a register in which details of the holder of the securities are entered and updated as appropriate. A transfer of registered securities is effected by amending the register.\n\n=== Non-certificated securities and global certificates ===\nModern practice has developed to eliminate both the need for certificates and maintenance of a complete security register by the issuer. There are two general ways this has been accomplished.\n\n==== Non-certificated securities ====\nIn some jurisdictions, such as France, it is possible for issuers of that jurisdiction to maintain a legal record of their securities electronically.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the current \"official\" version of Article 8 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] permits non-certificated securities.

This depository is called [[The Depository Trust Company]], or DTC. DTC's parent, [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities on behalf of all the DTC participants.\n\nAll securities traded through DTC are in fact held, in electronic form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g., a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at local broker Jones & Co. brokers. In turn, Jones & Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones & Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones & Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books for the benefit of customers like Jones & Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called [[beneficial ownership]]. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in \"Street name\".\n\nAmong brokerages and mutual fund companies, a large amount of mutual fund share transactions take place among intermediaries as opposed to shares being sold and redeemed directly with the transfer agent of the fund. Most of these intermediaries such as brokerage firms clear the shares electronically through the National Securities Clearing Corp. or \"NSCC\", a subsidiary of DTCC.\n\n==== Other depositories ====\nBesides DTC, two other large securities depositories exist, both in Europe: Euroclear and Clearstream.\n\n=== Divided and undivided security ===\nThe terms \"divided\" and \"undivided\" relate to the proprietary nature of a security.\n\nEach divided security constitutes a separate asset, which is legally distinct from each other security in the same issue. Pre-electronic bearer securities were divided. Each instrument constitutes the separate covenant of the issuer and is a separate debt.\n\nWith undivided securities, the entire issue makes up one single asset, with each of the securities being a fractional part of this undivided whole. Shares in the secondary markets are always undivided. The issuer owes only one set of obligations to shareholders under its memorandum, articles of association and company law. A [[share (finance)|share]] represents an undivided fractional part of the issuing company. Registered debt securities also have this undivided nature.\n\n=== Fungible and non-fungible securities ===\nIn a non-[[Fungibility|fungible]] security, certain characteristics of the owner are checked for when they use a feature of the security and affects how they can use that feature. For example, a bond may have a different maturation date depending on what countries its owner is a citizen of. \n\nIn a fungible security, the rules of the security aren't affected by judgement made about the owner.\n\n== Regulation ==\nIn the US, the public offer and sale of securities must be either registered pursuant to a registration statement that is filed with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) or are offered and sold pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Dealing in securities is regulated by both federal authorities (SEC) and state securities departments. In addition, the brokerage industry is supposedly self policed by Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs), such as the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA), formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers (or NASD) or the MSRB.\n\nWith respect to investment schemes that do not fall within the traditional categories of securities listed in the definition of a security (Sec. 2(a)(1) of the 33 act and Sec. 3(a)(10) of the 34 act) the US Courts have developed a broad definition for securities that must then be registered with the SEC. When determining if there is an \"investment contract\" that must be registered the courts look for an investment of money, a common enterprise and expectation of profits to come primarily from the efforts of others.

Howey Co.]]''\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Commercial law]]\n* [[Finance]]\n* [[Financial market]]\n* [[Financial regulation]]\n* [[History of private equity and venture capital]]\n* [[Interest in securities]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n* [[Securities analyst]]\n* [[Securities lending]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Settlement (finance)]]\n* [[Single-stock futures]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n* [[T2S]]\n* [[Toxic security]]\n* [[Trading account assets]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking}}\n{{hedge funds}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Security (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Securities (finance)| ]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCollateral:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: time consuming \u2192 time-consuming", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)"}

The face of the group was Jive Bunny, a cartoon rabbit who appeared in the videos, and also (as a human being in a costume) did promotional appearances for them.\n\nDoncaster DJ and producer [[Les Hemstock]] created the original \"Swing the Mood\" mix for the Music Factory owned Mastermix DJ service. It was then taken from there and developed as a single release by father and son team John and Andrew Pickles.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The name Jive Bunny came from a nickname Andy Pickles used to call a friend.<ref name=\"Campbell\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j4McAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mmMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6831,9358541&dq=jive+bunny+and+the+mastermixers&hl=en |title=Jive Bunny has Europe hopping |first=Mary |last=Campbell |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=29 November 1989 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> Ian Morgan a fellow DJ and co-producer also engineered and mixed some of the early releases along with Andy Pickles. Morgan was replaced in the early 1990s by DJ and producer Mark \"The Hitman\" Smith.\n\nJive Bunny's three number ones during 1989 were \"[[Swing the Mood]]\",<ref name=\"Campbell\" /> \"[[That's What I Like (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|That's What I Like]]\" and \"[[Let's Party (song)|Let's Party]]\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 283}}</ref> All three songs used [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Synthesizer|synthesisers]] to combine pop music from the early [[rock 'n' roll]] era together into a medley.\n\n==Musical career==\nThe act had 11 entries in the UK singles chart between July 1989 and November 1991. Each track used a sampled [[instrumental]] theme to join the old songs together, in much the same way as [[dance music]] [[megamix]]es.  \"Swing the Mood\" began with [[Glenn Miller]]'s \"[[In the Mood]]\" (a recording from 1939), followed immediately by rhythmic re-editing of [[Bill Haley and His Comets]]' \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\", [[Little Richard]]'s \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" and the [[Everly Brothers]]' \"[[Wake Up, Little Susie]]\". \"Swing the Mood\" was No. 1 for five weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1989, and quickly caught on in the United States, where it reached No. 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]].\n\n\"That's What I Like\" featured the [[theme music]] from the television police drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', with overlaid excerpts from rock hits like [[Chubby Checker]]'s \"[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]\" and [[Ernie Maresca]]'s \"[[Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)]]\". \"[[Let's Party (song)|Let's Party]]\" (released originally in the U.S. as \"March of the Mods\") used \"March of the Mods\" (also known as the Finnjenka Dance), interpolating [[Del Shannon]]'s \"[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]\" and [[The Wrens (R&B band)|The Wrens]]' \"Come Back My Love\" among others. In the UK \"Let's Party\" was a Christmas hit with samples of [[Wizzard]]'s \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\", [[Slade]]'s \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" and [[Gary Glitter]]'s \"Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas\". Recently this has been remixed to remove the Gary Glitter track to avoid controversy over his subsequent criminal convictions and, somewhat [[anachronism|anachronistically]], replace it with [[Mariah Carey]]'s \"[[All I Want For Christmas Is You]]\", should any radio stations wish to play it over the Christmas period. They did not have permission to use the original Wizzard recording so [[Roy Wood]] re-recorded the part of the track for them.\n\nThe original European medleys featured the original recordings by the original artists. Legalities prevented certain of the original recordings to be reused in [[United States|America]], so the American Jive Bunny releases substituted later re-recordings of the same tunes by [[Bill Haley]], [[Del Shannon]] and others. Later reissues further replaced some of these artists, such as [[Bill Haley]] and [[Elvis]], with impersonator-singers.\n\nThe original idea for the project came from [[Les Hemstock]] on the DJ-only Mastermix [[DJ service]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=208|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> The original \"Swing The Mood\" mix appeared on Issue 22 of Mastermix's monthly album release. John Pickles (father of Andy Pickles) was never in the band, but was the owner of the label and effectively the [[Talent manager|manager]].\n\n[[Les Hemstock]] later became a trance DJ working with [[Paul Van Dyk]]. Andy Pickles, went on to found the [[hard house]] record label, [[Tidy Trax]], with fellow DJ Amadeus Mozart. Ian Morgan became a successful club DJ and Mark Smith later worked in the [[music industry]] as a label manager and producer.\n\nThe Mastermix DJ Music Service is now in its 30th year and still supplies mixes and DJ compilations on CD and digital download.\n\n==Partial discography==\n===Notable albums and compilations===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications\n!

The face of the group was Jive Bunny, a cartoon rabbit who appeared in the videos, and also (as a human being in a costume) did promotional appearances for them.\n\nDoncaster DJ and producer Les Hemstock created the original \"Swing the Mood\" mix for the Music Factory owned Mastermix DJ service. It was then taken from there and developed as a single release by father and son team John and Andrew Pickles.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The name Jive Bunny came from a nickname Andy Pickles used to call a friend.<ref name=\"Campbell\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j4McAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mmMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6831,9358541&dq=jive+bunny+and+the+mastermixers&hl=en |title=Jive Bunny has Europe hopping |first=Mary |last=Campbell |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=29 November 1989 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> Ian Morgan a fellow DJ and co-producer also engineered and mixed some of the early releases along with Andy Pickles. Morgan was replaced in the early 1990s by DJ and producer Mark \"The Hitman\" Smith.\n\nJive Bunny's three number ones during 1989 were \"[[Swing the Mood]]\",<ref name=\"Campbell\" /> \"[[That's What I Like (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|That's What I Like]]\" and \"[[Let's Party (song)|Let's Party]]\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 283}}</ref> All three songs used [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Synthesizer|synthesisers]] to combine pop music from the early [[rock 'n' roll]] era together into a medley.\n\n==Musical career==\nThe act had 11 entries in the UK singles chart between July 1989 and November 1991. Each track used a sampled [[instrumental]] theme to join the old songs together, in much the same way as [[dance music]] [[megamix]]es.  \"Swing the Mood\" began with [[Glenn Miller]]'s \"[[In the Mood]]\" (a recording from 1939), followed immediately by rhythmic re-editing of [[Bill Haley and His Comets]]' \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\", [[Little Richard]]'s \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" and the [[Everly Brothers]]' \"[[Wake Up, Little Susie]]\". \"Swing the Mood\" was No. 1 for five weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1989, and quickly caught on in the United States, where it reached No. 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]].\n\n\"That's What I Like\" featured the [[theme music]] from the television police drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', with overlaid excerpts from rock hits like [[Chubby Checker]]'s \"[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]\" and [[Ernie Maresca]]'s \"[[Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)]]\". \"[[Let's Party (song)|Let's Party]]\" (released originally in the U.S. as \"March of the Mods\") used \"March of the Mods\" (also known as the Finnjenka Dance), interpolating [[Del Shannon]]'s \"[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]\" and [[The Wrens (R&B band)|The Wrens]]' \"Come Back My Love\" among others. In the UK \"Let's Party\" was a Christmas hit with samples of [[Wizzard]]'s \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\", [[Slade]]'s \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" and [[Gary Glitter]]'s \"Another Rock 'N' Roll Christmas\". Recently this has been remixed to remove the Gary Glitter track to avoid controversy over his subsequent criminal convictions and, somewhat [[anachronism|anachronistically]], replace it with [[Mariah Carey]]'s \"[[All I Want For Christmas Is You]]\", should any radio stations wish to play it over the Christmas period. They did not have permission to use the original Wizzard recording so [[Roy Wood]] re-recorded the part of the track for them.\n\nThe original European medleys featured the original recordings by the original artists. Legalities prevented certain of the original recordings to be reused in [[United States|America]], so the American Jive Bunny releases substituted later re-recordings of the same tunes by Bill Haley, Del Shannon and others. Later reissues further replaced some of these artists, such as Bill Haley and Elvis, with impersonator-singers.\n\nThe original idea for the project came from Hemstock on the DJ-only Mastermix [[DJ service]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=208|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> The original \"Swing The Mood\" mix appeared on Issue 22 of Mastermix's monthly album release. John Pickles (father of Andy) was never in the band, but was the owner of the label and effectively the [[Talent manager|manager]].\n\nHemstock later became a trance DJ working with [[Paul Van Dyk]]. Pickles Jr., went on to found the [[hard house]] record label, [[Tidy Trax]], with fellow DJ Amadeus Mozart. Morgan became a successful club DJ and Smith later worked in the [[music industry]] as a label manager and producer.\n\nThe Mastermix DJ Music Service is now in its 30th year and still supplies mixes and DJ compilations on CD and digital download.\n\n==Partial discography==\n===Notable albums and compilations===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications\n!

Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the [[Permanent Settlement]] in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the [[Radcliffe Line]] placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal.  Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948.<ref name=history>{{cite web| url =  http://wbpspm.gov.in/publications/District%20Human%20Development%20Report |title =  District Human Development Report  | work=  Uttar Dinajpur.

The township of [[Kishanganj]] and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district.

Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger [[Barind Tract]] The soil is composed of different varieties of [[alluvium]].  The main rivers are: [[Nagar River (Rangpur)|Nagar]], [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]], Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and [[Tangon River|Tangon]]. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during [[monsoon]], overflow the banks. The Nagar river flows along the international border with Bangladesh on the east of Islampur CD Block. The Sanauna, Dalaucha and Raba rivers flow through Islampur CD Block.<ref>{{cite web| url =  http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1904_PART_A_DCHB_UTTAR%20DINAJPUR.pdf |title =  District Census Handbook Uttar Dinajpur, Series 20, Part XII A | work= Census of India 2011, Pages 13-14: Physiography, Drainage |publisher= Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal  | accessdate = 24 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=censusmap>{{cite web| url =  http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1904_PART_A_DCHB_UTTAR%20DINAJPUR.pdf |title =  District Census Handbook Uttar Dinajpur, Series 20, Part XII A | work= Page 137: Map of Islampur CD Block |publisher= Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal  | accessdate = 24 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =  http://wbpspm.gov.in/publications/District%20Human%20Development%20Report |title =  District Human Development Report  | work=  Uttar Dinajpur.

Despite the formation of an international border in 1947, none of the PS areas in the area which later formed Islampur SD showed much increase in settlement density between 1941\u201351, and accelerated settlement only came into evidence in this region after 1961, following their transfer from Bihar to West Bengal. Thus, as population growth in the Uttar Dinajpur region accelerated considerably under the impetus of partition migration after 1951, the Islampur SD areas offered additional living space, easing the overall migration pressure on the region.<ref name=population>{{cite web| url =  http://wbpspm.gov.in/publications/District%20Human%20Development%20Report |title =  District Human Development Report  | work=  Uttar Dinajpur.

Thus, no deceleration in population growth rates occurred in the district until after 1991\u2026 In addition to [[Illegal immigration in India|Hindu and tribal migrants]] from across the international border, a sizeable number of migrant Muslims have also settled in the district, mainly driven by economic reasons\u2026 migrants from other states comprised 23% of the total migrants residing in Uttar Dinajpur.\u201d The large number of migrants from other states is mainly from the neighbouring areas in Bihar.<ref name=population/>\n\nA study by North Bengal University has observed that \u201cImmigrants from East Pakistan/Bangladesh have arrived in Uttar Dinajpur in almost equal numbers before and after 1971.\u201d The Human Development Report opines, \u201cThe overall post-Partition impact on the rates of demographic growth has been particularly strong in all North Bengal districts.

Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the [[Permanent Settlement]] in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the [[Radcliffe Line]] placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal.

The township of [[Kishanganj]] and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959.
