He is best known as the pilot who flew the [[B-29 Superfortress]] known as the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' (named after his mother) when it dropped [[Little Boy]], the first of two [[atomic bombs]] used in warfare, on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]].\n\nTibbets enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1937 and qualified as a pilot in 1938. After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he flew anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic. In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which was equipped with the [[Boeing B-17]]. In July 1942, the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the [[Eighth Air Force]], and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight [[heavy bomber]] mission against [[Occupied Europe]] on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Mark W. Clark]] and [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].\n\nTibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], which would conduct the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. After the war, he participated in the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapon]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] in the early 1950s. He commanded the [[308th Armament Systems Wing|308th Bombardment Wing]] and [[6th Air Division]] in the late 1950s, and was [[military attach\u00e9]] in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation]], serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.\n\n== Early life ==\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. e Was very weird and he was ugly and gay cause he likes anime\nIn the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to [[Alton, Illinois]], where he graduated from [[Western Military Academy]] in 1933. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] in 1934.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's [[Opa-locka Airport]] with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at [[Eastern Airlines]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati]] after his second year to complete his [[pre-med]] studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the [[United States Army]] and become a pilot in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}}\n\n== Early military career ==\nBecause he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=41}} On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]], [[Kentucky]], and was sent to [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#Air Corps, World War II, Cold War and Post-Cold War changes|pilot rating]] in 1938 at [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]] in San Antonio.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}}\n\nAfter graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the [[16th Electronic Warfare Squadron|16th Observation Squadron]], which was based at [[Lawson Field]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] supporting the [[Infantry School]] at nearby [[Fort Benning]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a [[department store]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], Georgia. The two quietly married in a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] seminary in [[Holy Trinity, Alabama|Holy Trinity]], [[Alabama]] on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=52\u201353}} They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from [[Huntingdon College]] and [[Auburn University]]. He was a [[colonel]] in the [[United States Army Reserves]] and worked as a hospital [[pharmacist]]. He died in [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]], [[Louisiana]], in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thenewsstar/obituary.aspx?n=paul-warfield-tibbets&pid=182059677&fhid=20705|title=Paul Warfield Tibbets, III|newspaper=[[The News-Star]]|date=23 October 2016|access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in [[Georgiana, Alabama|Georgiana]] in [[Butler County, Alabama|Butler County]] in southern Alabama.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/montgomeryadvertiser/obituary.aspx?pid=157738762 |title=Gene Tibbets Obituary |newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|date=23 May 2012|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"death1\" />\n\nWhile Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning,  he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]]{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}}  and served as a personal pilot for [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[George S. Patton Jr.|George S. Patton, Jr.]], in 1940 and 1941.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the [[9th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[3d Bombardment Group]] at [[Hunter Air Force Base|Hunter Field]], [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the [[A-20 Havoc]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=62\u201363}}  While there he was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. In December 1941, he received orders to join the [[29th Bombardment Group]] at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Field]], [[Florida]], for training on the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] while listening to the radio during a routine flight.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=65}} Due to fears that German [[U-Boats]] might enter [[Tampa Bay]] and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=66\u201367}} Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at [[Pope Air Force Base|Pope Army Airfield]], [[North Carolina]], with 21 [[B-18 Bolo]] medium bombers.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} The B-18s were used as an intermediate trainer, which pilots flew after basic flight training in a [[Cessna UC-78]] and before qualifying in the B-17.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=70}}\n\n== War against Germany ==\n[[File:Boeing B-17D in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing B-17D in flight|alt=A four-engine propeller aircraft]]\nIn February 1942, Tibbets reported for duty with the 29th Bombardment Group as its engineering officer.

In the first weeks of August 1942, under the tutelage of [[Royal Air Force]] veterans, the group received intensive training for its first mission. The group commander,  [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Cornelius W. Cousland,{{sfn|Goldberg|1948|pp=656\u2013657}} was replaced by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Frank A. Armstrong Jr.]], who appointed Tibbets as his deputy.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=79}}\n\nTibbets flew the lead bomber ''Butcher Shop''<ref name=\"Rouen Raid\">{{cite web|title=VIII Bomber Command 1 - 17 August 1942|url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/1492|publisher=American Air Museum in Britain|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref> for the first American daylight heavy bomber mission on 17 August 1942, a shallow-penetration raid against a [[marshalling yard]] in [[Rouen]] in [[Occupied France]], with Armstrong as his co-pilot. This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, ''Red Gremlin'', nor his regular crew, which included [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] [[Thomas Ferebee]] and navigator [[Theodore Van Kirk]], who later flew with him in ''Enola Gay''.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=81\u201382}} On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of [[Lille]]. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=155\u2013156}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=96\u201399}}\n\nOn that first mission, Tibbets saw in real time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians.  At the time, he thought to himself, \"People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed.  Those are not soldiers.\"  But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor.  This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales.  The reason why they had failed the program was because \"they had too much sympathy for their patients\", which \"destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities\".  It dawned on Tibbets that:{{quote| I am just like that if I get to thinking about some innocent person getting hit on the ground. I am supposed to be a bomber pilot and destroy a target. I won't be worth anything if I do that ... I made up my mind then that the morality of dropping that bomb was not my business. I was instructed to perform a military mission to drop the bomb. That was the thing that I was going to do the best of my ability. Morality, there is no such thing in warfare. I don't care whether you are dropping atom bombs, or 100-pound bombs, or shooting a rifle. You have got to leave the moral issue out of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/general-paul-tibbets-%E2%80%93-reflections-hiroshima |title=General Paul Tibbets - Reflections on Hiroshima |publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation |access-date=12 August 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the leadup to [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of [[North Africa]], the commander of the Eighth Air Force, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Carl Spaatz]] was ordered to provide his best two pilots for a secret mission. He chose Tibbets and Major Wayne Connors. Tibbets flew Major General [[Mark W. Clark]] from [[RAF Polebrook|Polebrook]] to [[Gibraltar]] while Connors flew Clark's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Lyman Lemnitzer]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=102\u2013105}} A few weeks later Tibbets flew the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], there.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=107\u2013109}}  \"By reputation\", historian [[Stephen Ambrose]] wrote, Tibbets was \"the best flier in the Army Air Force.\"{{sfn|Ambrose|1998|p=40}}\n\nTibbets had flown 25 combat missions against targets in France<ref name=\"USAF\" /> when the 97th Bomb Group was transferred to North Africa as part of Major General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]'s [[Twelfth Air Force]]. For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He said that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing  his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=157\u2013158}} was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel [[Lauris Norstad]], Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.<ref name=\"USAF\" /> Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]], but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers. He was told that Norstad had vetoed the promotion, saying \"there's only going to be one colonel in operations.\"{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=129}}\n\nTibbets did not get along well with Norstad, or with Doolittle's chief of staff, Brigadier General [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]. In one planning meeting, Norstad wanted an all-out raid on [[Bizerte]] to be flown at {{convert|6000|ft}}. Tibbets protested that [[flak]] would be most effective at that altitude. When challenged by Norstad, Tibbets said he would lead the mission himself at 6,000 feet if Norstad would fly as his co-pilot. Norstad backed down, and the mission was successfully flown at {{convert|20000|ft}}.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=129\u2013132}}\n\n== War against Japan ==\n[[File:Tibbets-wave.jpg|thumb|upright|Tibbets waves from ''Enola Gay'' before the Hiroshima bombing mission.|alt=A man waves from the cockpit window of a plane with the words \"Enola Gay\" written on it]]\nWhen [[General (United States)|General]] [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold]], the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]], requested an experienced bombardment pilot to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bomber, Doolittle recommended Tibbets.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=133}} Tibbets returned to the United States in February 1943. At the time, the B-29 program was beset by a host of technical problems, and the chief test pilot, [[Edmund T. Allen]], had been killed in a crash of the prototype aircraft.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=140}}\n\nWorking with [[Spirit AeroSystems|the Boeing plant]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], Tibbets test-flew the B-29 and soon accumulated more flight time in it than any other pilot. He found that without defensive armament and armor plating, the aircraft was {{convert|7000|lb}} lighter, and its performance was much improved. In simulated combat engagements against a [[P-47]] fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}}, he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=158\u2013159}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nAfter a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the [[17th Air Division|17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], a B-29 training unit based at [[Grand Island Army Airfield|Grand Island Army Air Field]], Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29.<ref name=\"USAF\" /> Tibbets taught two [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], [[Dora Dougherty Strother|Dora Dougherty]] and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to fly the B-29 as demonstration pilots.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\nOn 1 September 1944, Tibbets reported to [[Colorado Springs Army Airfield]], the headquarters of the [[Second Air Force]], where he met with its commander, Major General [[Uzal Ent]], and three representatives of the [[Manhattan Project]], Lieutenant Colonel [[John Lansdale Jr.]], [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], and [[Norman F. Ramsey Jr.]], who briefed him on the project.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=583\u2013584}} Tibbets was told that he would be in charge of the [[509th Composite Group]], a fully self-contained organization of about 1,800 men, which would have 15 B-29s and a high priority for all kinds of [[materiel|military stores]]. Ent gave Tibbets a choice of three possible bases: [[Great Bend Army Airfield]], Kansas; [[Mountain Home Army Airfield]], Idaho; or [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=157\u2013163}} Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\nWhen the operation was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel [[Roscoe C. Wilson]] were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the [[atomic bomb]]. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Tinian Joint Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\": Rear Admiral [[William R.

He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who were working on the Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were \"sanitary workers\". At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to unplug a drain.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=173}}\n\nOn 6 March 1945 (concurrent with the activation of [[Project Alberta]]), the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated at Wendover, again using Army Air Forces personnel on hand or already at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]]. Its purpose was to provide \"skilled machinists, welders and munitions workers\"{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|p=1}} and special equipment to the group to enable it to assemble atomic weapons at its operating base, thereby allowing the weapons to be transported more safely in their component parts. A rigorous candidate selection process was used to recruit personnel, reportedly with an 80% rejection rate. The 509th Composite Group reached full strength in May 1945.{{sfn|509th Composite Group|1945|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nWith the addition of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to [[Tinian]], an island in the northern [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of [[Project Alberta]]. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island:{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=25}} the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]], and [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R.

In February 1942, he became the commanding officer of the [[340th Bombardment Squadron]] of the [[97th Bombardment Group]], which was equipped with the [[Boeing B-17]]. In July 1942, the 97th became the first heavy bombardment group to be deployed as part of the [[Eighth Air Force]], and Tibbets became deputy group commander. He flew the lead plane in the first American daylight [[heavy bomber]] mission against [[Occupied Europe]] on 17 August 1942, and the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe on 9 October 1942. Tibbets was chosen to fly [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Mark W. Clark]] and [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to Gibraltar. After flying 43 combat missions, he became the assistant for bomber operations on the staff of the [[Twelfth Air Force]].\n\nTibbets returned to the United States in February 1943 to help with the development of the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. In September 1944, he was appointed the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], which would conduct the [[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. After the war, he participated in the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear weapon]] tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in mid-1946, and was involved in the development of the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] in the early 1950s. He commanded the [[308th Armament Systems Wing|308th Bombardment Wing]] and [[6th Air Division]] in the late 1950s, and was [[military attach\u00e9]] in India from 1964 to 1966. After leaving the Air Force in 1966, he worked for [[NetJets|Executive Jet Aviation]], serving on the founding board and as its president from 1976 until his retirement in 1987.\n\n== Early life ==\nPaul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in [[Quincy, Illinois]], on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to [[Davenport, Iowa]], and then to Iowa's capital, [[Des Moines]], where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to [[Hialeah, Florida]], to escape from harsh [[midwest]]ern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by [[Barnstorming|barnstormer]] [[Doug Davis (aviator)|Doug Davis]], dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the [[Hialeah Park Race Track]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}}{{sfn|Marx|1967|p=79}}\n\nIn the late 1920s, business issues forced Tibbets's family to return to [[Alton, Illinois]], where he graduated from [[Western Military Academy]] in 1933. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]],{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] in 1934.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's [[Opa-locka Airport]] with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at [[Eastern Airlines]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=33}} After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati]] after his second year to complete his [[pre-med]] studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only a year and a half as he changed his mind about wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the [[United States Army]] and become a pilot in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}}\n\n== Early military career ==\nBecause he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]].{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=41}} On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]], [[Kentucky]], and was sent to [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] and received his [[U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating#Air Corps, World War II, Cold War and Post-Cold War changes|pilot rating]] in 1938 at [[Kelly Air Force Base|Kelly Field]] in San Antonio.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}}\n\nAfter graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the [[16th Electronic Warfare Squadron|16th Observation Squadron]], which was based at [[Lawson Field]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] supporting the [[Infantry School]] at nearby [[Fort Benning]].{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=153\u2013155}} It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a [[department store]] in [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], Georgia. The two quietly married in a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] seminary in [[Holy Trinity, Alabama|Holy Trinity]], [[Alabama]] on June 19, 1938.

The group commander,  [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Cornelius W.

This was not Tibbets's regular aircraft, ''Red Gremlin'', nor his regular crew, which included [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] [[Thomas Ferebee]] and navigator [[Theodore Van Kirk]], who later flew with him in ''Enola Gay''.{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=81\u201382}} On 9 October 1942, Tibbets led the first American raid of more than 100 bombers in Europe, attacking industrial targets in the French city of [[Lille]]. Poor bombing accuracy resulted in numerous civilian casualties and less damage to the rail installations than hoped, but the mission was hailed an overall success because it reached its target against heavy and constant fighter attack. Of the 108 aircraft in the raid, 33 were shot down or had to turn back due to mechanical problems.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=155\u2013156}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=96\u201399}}\n\nOn that first mission, Tibbets saw in real time that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians.  At the time, he thought to himself, \"People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed.  Those are not soldiers.\"  But then he thought back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor.  This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program and ended up in drug sales.  The reason why they had failed the program was because \"they had too much sympathy for their patients\", which \"destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities\".  It dawned on Tibbets that:{{quote| I am just like that if I get to thinking about some innocent person getting hit on the ground. I am supposed to be a bomber pilot and destroy a target.

That was the thing that I was going to do the best of my ability. Morality, there is no such thing in warfare. I don't care whether you are dropping atom bombs, or 100-pound bombs, or shooting a rifle.

For Tibbets, the war in North Africa introduced him to the realities of aerial warfare. He said that he saw the real effects of bombing civilians and the trauma of losing  his brothers in arms. In January 1943, Tibbets, who had now flown 43 combat missions,{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=157\u2013158}} was assigned as the assistant for bomber operations to Colonel [[Lauris Norstad]], Assistant Chief of Staff of Operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force.<ref name=\"USAF\" /> Tibbets had recently been given a battlefield promotion to [[colonel]], but did not receive it, as such promotions had to be confirmed by a panel of officers.

In simulated combat engagements against a [[P-47]] fighter at the B-29's cruising altitude of {{convert|30000|ft}}, he discovered that the B-29 had a smaller turning radius than the P-47, and could avoid it by turning away.{{sfn|Kingseed|2006|pp=158\u2013159}}{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nAfter a year of developmental testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the [[17th Air Division|17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy)]], a B-29 training unit based at [[Grand Island Army Airfield|Grand Island Army Air Field]], Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong.

Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, but he was in his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations.

The stories are written or told and are named narratives. Most often, narratives are used to recount a story or in other cases to express an opinion or give information to circumscribe a situation like e.g. past events from the perspective of the storyteller. This use of narrative communication may be more effective than enumerating facts and statistics, because it provides an experience people can understand and share. Narrative communication is one way, as in a speaker addressing an audience.\n\n==What is narrative communication?==\nNarrative communication is an account of events over a passage of time shared to one or many listeners. The time it takes to tell these narratives can vary. As per Kellas, \u201cPeople build and communicate their relationships, cultures, and identities, in part through the stories they tell\u201d  (Baxter, 241).  One may ask, why not call it \u201cstory telling theory\u201d, instead of narrative theory?  Most communication scholars view this as the story being retold in a micro fashion which does not have extensive details. While the term 'narrative' encompasses a macro aspect than just [[story telling]]. For example, a story is generally describing or recounting a noteworthy event in someone\u2019s life, whereas a narrative for example is not just the event but could describe multiple events to a whole sequence of someone in more detail than just telling one single story about the person. There are two types of narratives that create the biggest impact in our lives. First there is personal narrative, second there are professional narratives.\n\n==Personal==\nThis concept explains that most of the narratives we use come from our personal experiences. When a friend or family member tells us about their day, and what has gone wrong to what is good, they are telling us how they want us to see them. History shows us that all cultures use some kind of narrative to form stories and dances to tell about their [[tribe]]s and [[culture]]s. Same as family stories that are passed down from generation to generation.\n\n==Professional==\nThis facet of narrative states that [[professionalism]] at the work place provides many outlets to produce narratives that express who we are (Alder & Rodmen, 2009 ). In the professional world we are exposed to many different cultures that shape how we share are narratives. This includes [[higher education]] and any organization we belong to.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Interpersonal communication]]\n* [[Narrative paradigm]]\n* [[Problematic integration theory]]\n\n==References==\n* Knobloch, L.

'''''Cold Case''''' is a drama about Lilly Rush, an enigmatic and highly effective detective on the Philadelphia Homicide Squad. Rush's instinctive understanding of the criminal mind and her singular passion for uncovering the truth makes her the perfect fit for investigating cold cases, yester-crimes that have remained unsolved \u2013 some only a few months old, others going back decades. Rush and her team use their wits to take on aging evidence and witnesses with buried secrets, uncovering fresh clues, digging into old wounds and doggedly pursuing the truth. Joining Rush on her mission are a team of talented detectives: Scotty Valens, Rush's confident and street-smart partner; Nick Vera, rough around the edges but a sharp investigator; Will Jeffries, an experienced veteran who's been around the block; Kat Miller, no-nonsense and resourceful; and Lieutenant John Stillman, Rush's mentor and sometime father figure. With their assistance, Rush is able to take on the toughest cases, giving voice to victims unable to speak for themselves \u2013 making sure none is ever forgotten. Season one regular cast members include [[Kathryn Morris]], [[Danny Pino]], [[John Finn]], [[Thom Barry]] and [[Jeremy Ratchford]]. In 3 episodes, [[Justin Chambers]] had played Chris Lassing, Lilly's partner on the Philadelphia Homicide Squad, but left the show to star as [[Alex Karev]] in ABC's hit drama show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!

'''''Cold Case''''' is a drama about Lilly Rush, an enigmatic and highly effective detective on the Philadelphia Homicide Squad. Rush's instinctive understanding of the criminal mind and her singular passion for uncovering the truth makes her the perfect fit for investigating cold cases, yester-crimes that have remained unsolved \u2013 some only a few months old, others going back decades. Rush and her team use their wits to take on aging evidence and witnesses with buried secrets, uncovering fresh clues, digging into old wounds and doggedly pursuing the truth. Joining Rush on her mission are a team of talented detectives: Scotty Valens, Rush's confident and street-smart partner; Nick Vera, rough around the edges but a sharp investigator; Will Jeffries, an experienced veteran who's been around the block; Kat Miller, no-nonsense and resourceful; and Lieutenant John Stillman, Rush's mentor and sometime father figure. With their assistance, Rush is able to take on the toughest cases, giving voice to victims unable to speak for themselves \u2013 making sure none is ever forgotten. Season one regular cast members include [[Kathryn Morris]], [[Danny Pino]], [[John Finn]], [[Thom Barry]] and [[Jeremy Ratchford]]. In 3 episodes, [[Justin Chambers]] had played Chris Lassing, Lilly's partner on the Philadelphia Homicide Squad, but left the show to star as [[Alex Karev]] in ABC's hit drama show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!

It consists of ten episodes. The show was produced by [[Shed Productions]] as part of [[Shed Media]]. After the first episode aired, the show became an instant hit in Britain. The show also became successful in several countries including America, [[Australia]] and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe first series focuses on the growing relationship between new G-Wing governor, [[Helen Stewart (Bad Girls)|Helen Stewart]] and prisoner, [[Nikki Wade]]. Helen tries to show the prisoners that she on their side by taking matters such as [[miscarriage]], [[bullying]] and [[drugs]] seriously, whereas the other officers, like [[Sylvia Hollamby]], don't take any interest in the prisoners' problems. Helen doesn't get the support she needs from her officers and tries to convince Nikki that she needs her help in running an orderly wing. This is when Nikki's attraction for Helen begins to grow. Other major storylines in the first series is top dog, [[Shell Dockley]]'s bullying against new prisoner [[Rachel Hicks]], her [[drug dealing]] and her affair with senior officer [[Jim Fenner]] who also begins an affair with Rachel, as three become involved in a love triangle, Shell and her sidekick [[Denny Blood]] torture Rachel to the point where she commits [[suicide]]. New prisoner [[Zandra Plackett]] struggles to kick her drug habit, and things get worse when she discovers she's pregnant, and [[Monica Lindsey]], another new prisoner on G-Wing, finds it hard to cope when she worries about her son, Spencer, who has [[down's syndrome]], she worries about how he will cope and react to his mother's wrongful imprisonment.\n\n==Main cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #521A57; color:white\"| Cast !! style=\"background-color: #521A57; color:white\"| Character\n|-\n| [[Simone Lahbib]] || [[Helen Stewart (Bad Girls)|Helen Stewart]]\n|-\n| [[Mandana Jones]] || [[Nikki Wade]]\n|-\n| [[Debra Stephenson]] || [[Shell Dockley]]\n|-\n| [[Jack Ellis (actor)|Jack Ellis]] || [[Jim Fenner]]\n|-\n| [[Lara Cazalet]] || [[Zandra Plackett]]\n|-\n| [[Alicya Eyo]] || [[Denny Blood]]\n|-\n| [[Luisa Bradshaw-White]] || [[Lorna Rose]]\n|-\n| [[Joe Shaw (actor)|Joe Shaw]] || [[Dominic McAllister]]\n|-\n| [[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]] || [[Sylvia Hollamby]]\n|-\n| [[Sharon Duncan Brewster]] || [[Crystal Gordon]]\n|-\n| [[Victoria Alcock]] || [[Julie Saunders]]\n|-\n| [[Kika Mirylees]] || [[Julie Johnston (Bad Girls)|Julie Johnston]]\n|-\n| [[Jane Lowe]] || [[Monica Lindsey|Monica Lindsay]]\n|-\n| [[Joanne Froggatt]] || [[Rachel Hicks]]\n|-\n| [[Linda Henry]] || [[Yvonne Atkins]]\n|}\n\n==Guest cast==\nRecurring cast:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Oliver Fox (actor)|Oliver Fox]] as [[Sean Parr]]\n*[[Roland Oliver (actor)|Roland Oliver]] as [[Simon Stubberfield]]\n*[[Eugene Walker]] as Officer Blakeson\n*[[Timmy Lang]] as Spencer Lindsay\n*[[Gideon Turner]] as Robin Dunstan\n*[[Denise Black]] as [[Jessie Devlin]]\n*[[Victoria Pritchard]] as Trisha\n{{div col end}}\nGuest cast:\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Ashley Miller (actress)|Ashley Miller]] as Carol Byatt\n*[[Penny Ryder]] as Nellie Snape\n*[[Shelley Longworth]] as Ms Wall\n*[[Susan Aderin]] as Ms Carter\n*[[Pauline Whitaker]] as Nun\n*[[Daryl Fisher]] as Mrs Hicks\n*[[Vinny Dhillon]] as Clinic Nurse\n*[[Sheila Ruskin]] as Mrs Dunstan\n*[[David Case (actor)|David Case]] as Chaplain\n*[[Jean Ainslie]] as Sister Jill\n*[[Ian Flintoff]] as Vicar\n*[[Jane Galloway]] as Mary\n*[[Andrew Frame (actor)|Andrew Frame]] as Officer Donegan\n*[[Alistair Stewart]] as Newsreader/Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Bad Girls episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table|background=#521A57|overall=|series=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|viewers= |country=UK|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Bad Girls (series 1)\n| Title = Them and Us\n| DirectedBy = Mike Adams\n| WrittenBy = Maureen Chadwick\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1999|6|1|df=y}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n| Viewers = 7.99\n| ShortSummary = As the inmates rehearse for a fashion show, a miscarrying inmate almost dies in her cell.

The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. In ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1880), [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the [[Capitalist state|bourgeois state]].

In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: <blockquote>Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward.

For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled \"There Is No Communism in Russia\" said of the Soviet Union: <blockquote>Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=649|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=RevoltLib}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: <blockquote>Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement \u2014 notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'.

At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?

One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. \n\nAs [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, \"one-man management\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production \u2014 [[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. \n\nIn sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 Left Communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].<ref>Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', ''Survey'' 62, January, pp. 58-71.</ref>\n\nThese criticisms were revived on the left of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] after the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] in 1921, which introduced the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\"/><ref>EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80</ref> The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.<ref>Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title=\"Makhaevism after Machajski\" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists ===\n{{Marxism}}\nImmediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. \n\nInstead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. \n\nConsequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one\u2014that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.<ref>Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P.

King]</ref>}}\n\nAfter 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Fyodor Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.<ref>Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40</ref> In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.<ref>State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump. Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. {{ISBN|0-333-36775-8}}</ref> As John O'Neill notes: {{quote| Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.<ref>STATE CAPITALISM - THE WAGES SYSTEM UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT - BUICK, A, CRUMP, J; ONEILL, J; POLITICAL QUARTERLY 59 (3): 398-399 JUL-SEP 1988</ref>}}\n\nWriting in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' on 25 April 25, [[Rudolf Hilferding]] rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital.

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].\n\nThe discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}</ref><ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\">{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Philippe Bourrinet, \"[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]\"</ref> \n\nOn release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga \"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\".<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\" /> [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).\n\nAfter 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.</ref> \n\nAnother is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.<ref>Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?</ref> A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.\n\nOther left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies include [[bureaucratic collectivism]], [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s and [[new class]].\n\n=== Use by later left communists and council communists ===\nThe [[left communist]] and [[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto R\u00fchle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm \"State Capitalism and Dictatorship\"] (1936).\n\n=== Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists ===\nFrom 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \"socialist\" states.<ref>[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.</ref> This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].\n\nAfter [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.</ref>\n\nMost current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards\u2014most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term [[social imperialism]] to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence\u2014their phrase, \"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\" denotes this.\n\n== Use by liberal economists ==\n{{economic liberalism sidebar}}\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]\n[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|first = Murray|last = Rothbard|authorlink = Murray Rothbard|contribution = A Future of Peace and Capitalism|editor = James H.

The explanation why is given by the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who states: <blockquote>The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism \u2014 until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name.

An example of this would be the [[military\u2013industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.\n\nBoth the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and World Economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.\n\nState capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Equinor]] and [[OMV]].\n\nThere are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's [[creative destruction]], of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.\n\n== In European studies ==\nSeveral European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. \n\nThe author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Vivien|last = Schmidt|authorlink = Vivien A.

Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]] identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.<ref>Resnick, Stephen & Wolff, Richard (2002) Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n== State monopoly capitalism ==\nThe theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought</ref> \n\nThe main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.\n\nState monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.\n\n=== Political implications ===\n{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965</ref>}}\nThe strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance.\n\n=== Neo-Trotskyist theory ===\nIn neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.\n\nThe [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.\n\nSome Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised\u2014the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the communist party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nWhen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949</ref>\n\nCritics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:\n* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. \n* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.\n* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neoliberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. \n* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the \"Buy n' Large\" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before and after the evacuation of Earth.\n* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, owned by the company, by breathing it.\n\n== Current forms in the 21st century ==\nState capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\nMany analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.</ref><ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.</ref><ref>''The Economist'' (2012). \"State Capitalism: The Visible Hand\".

In all three cases, the state is using markets to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit. And in all three cases, the ultimate motive is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival). This is a form of capitalism but one in which the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain.}}\n\nFollowing on Bremmer, Aligica, and Tarko<ref>Aligica, Paul and Vlad Tarko (2012). \"State Capitalism and the Rent-SeekingConjecture\", ''Constitutional Political Economy ''23(4): 357-379</ref> further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a [[rent-seeking]] society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.\n\nIn his article \"We're All State Capitalists Now\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against \"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps.

In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: <blockquote>Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward.

For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled \"There Is No Communism in Russia\" said of the Soviet Union: <blockquote>Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=649|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=RevoltLib}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: <blockquote>Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement \u2014 notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'.

At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?

One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. \n\nAs [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, \"one-man management\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production \u2014 [[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. \n\nIn sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 Left Communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].<ref>Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967.

Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\"/><ref>EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80</ref> The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.<ref>Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title=\"Makhaevism after Machajski\" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists ===\n{{Marxism}}\nImmediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. \n\nInstead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. \n\nConsequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one\u2014that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.<ref>Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P.

King]</ref>}}\n\nAfter 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Fyodor Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.<ref>Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40</ref> In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.<ref>State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump. Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. {{ISBN|0-333-36775-8}}</ref> As John O'Neill notes: {{quote| Whatever other merits or problems their theories had, in arguing that the Russian revolution was from the outset a capitalist revolution they avoided the ad hoc and post hoc nature of more recent Maoist- and Trotskyist-inspired accounts of state capitalism, which start from the assumption that the Bolshevik revolution inaugurated a socialist economy that at some later stage degenerated into capitalism.<ref>STATE CAPITALISM - THE WAGES SYSTEM UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT - BUICK, A, CRUMP, J; ONEILL, J; POLITICAL QUARTERLY 59 (3): 398-399 JUL-SEP 1988</ref>}}\n\nWriting in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' on 25 April 25, [[Rudolf Hilferding]] rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital.

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].\n\nThe discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}</ref><ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\">{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Philippe Bourrinet, \"[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]\"</ref> \n\nOn release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga \"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\".<ref name=\"Fox - Ante Ciliga\" /> [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).\n\nAfter 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.</ref> \n\nAnother is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.<ref>Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?</ref> A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.\n\nOther left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies include [[bureaucratic collectivism]], [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s and [[new class]].\n\n=== Use by later left communists and council communists ===\nThe [[left communist]] and [[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto R\u00fchle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm \"State Capitalism and Dictatorship\"] (1936).\n\n=== Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists ===\nFrom 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \"socialist\" states.<ref>[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.</ref> This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].\n\nAfter [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]], most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.</ref>\n\nMost current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards\u2014most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term [[social imperialism]] to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence\u2014their phrase, \"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\" denotes this.\n\n== Use by liberal economists ==\n{{economic liberalism sidebar}}\n[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]\n[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|first = Murray|last = Rothbard|authorlink = Murray Rothbard|contribution = A Future of Peace and Capitalism|editor = James H.

The explanation why is given by the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who states: <blockquote>The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism \u2014 until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name.

An example of this would be the [[military\u2013industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.\n\nBoth the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and World Economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.\n\nState capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Equinor]] and [[OMV]].\n\nThere are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's [[creative destruction]], of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.\n\n== In European studies ==\nSeveral European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. \n\nThe author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|first = Vivien|last = Schmidt|authorlink = Vivien A.

Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]] identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.<ref>Resnick, Stephen & Wolff, Richard (2002) Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n== State monopoly capitalism ==\nThe theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought</ref> \n\nThe main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.\n\nState monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.\n\n=== Political implications ===\n{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965</ref>}}\nThe strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance.\n\n=== Neo-Trotskyist theory ===\nIn neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.\n\nThe [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.\n\nSome Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised\u2014the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the communist party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nWhen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\".<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949</ref>\n\nCritics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:\n* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. \n* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.\n* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neoliberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. \n* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee.\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the \"Buy n' Large\" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before and after the evacuation of Earth.\n* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, owned by the company, by breathing it.\n\n== Current forms in the 21st century ==\nState capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.\n\n=== Mainland China ===\nMany analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.</ref><ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.</ref><ref>''The Economist'' (2012). \"State Capitalism: The Visible Hand\".

In all three cases, the state is using markets to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit. And in all three cases, the ultimate motive is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival). This is a form of capitalism but one in which the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain.}}\n\nFollowing on Bremmer, Aligica, and Tarko<ref>Aligica, Paul and Vlad Tarko (2012). \"State Capitalism and the Rent-SeekingConjecture\", ''Constitutional Political Economy ''23(4): 357-379</ref> further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a [[rent-seeking]] society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.\n\nIn his article \"We're All State Capitalists Now\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against \"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary\".<ref name=Ferguson/> He then notes:<ref name=Ferguson/> {{quotation|The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle.

The reason for this categorization is the existence of [[financial market]]s in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a [[basic income]]/[[social dividend]] or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature.
