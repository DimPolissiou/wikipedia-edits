CNB is responsible for coordinating all matters pertaining to drug eradication. Its current director is Mr. Ng Ser Song.\n\n==History==\nOn 19 October 1971, the [[Government of Singapore]] announced that a new and dedicated Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), would be set up within the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].  Then-Minister for Home Affairs [[Wong Lin Ken]] said, \"Such activities will be coordinated in the Central Narcotics Bureau. CNB also plans to build a capacity to educate the public in the dangers of drug abuse\".\n\t\nIn 1973, Singapore's government introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA)15 to deal with drug traffickers, pushers and addicts. The enactment of the MDA was intended to consolidate the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance 1951 (DDO) and Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1969 (DPMA), and secondly to more effectively deal with the worsening drug situation. New legislation was deemed to be necessary by then-Minister for Health and Home Affairs [[Chua Sian Chin]] in Parliament in 1973. \"The Dangerous Drugs Act (i.e DDO) was enacted about 21 years ago and the controls provided therein are grossly inadequate for the 70's, with the introduction of a host of new drugs of medical value if properly used.\" The need was exacerbated by Singapore's geographical location and development into a trading hub. The proximity to the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] is another oft-cited justification for tough anti-drug laws.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn November 1993, the \"Committee to Improve the Drug Situation in [[Singapore]]\" was set up to look into the drug situation and it recommended a total and integrated approach to deal with the drug problem. The four main anti-drug strategies are Preventive Drug Education, Rigorous Enforcement, Treatment and Rehabilitation for addicts, and Aftercare and Continued Rehabilitation for ex-addicts to reintegrate them into society. CNB was to be in charge of Rigorous Enforcement and Preventive Drug Education.\n\n==Functions==\n{{main|Capital punishment in Singapore}}{{main|Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)}}\n\n===Drug enforcement===\n\n==== Legal Powers ====\nAll Narcotics Officers are defined as an \"officer of the Bureau\" under the Misuse of Drugs Act. This empowers them to enter and search any place reasonably believed to contain controlled drugs without a warrant. They may also search a person or subject persons to urine or hair tests.\n\n==== Raids ====\nCNB conducts regular nationwide operations to conduct checks against drug abusers and ex-drug abusers who may have relapsed. Other than island-wide operations, CNB conducts operations targeted at specific areas where intelligence sources indicate that drug activity is taking place. CNB officers also work in closely with officers from other Home Team agencies such as the Singapore Police Force and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n<ref>{{cite news|title=Drug syndicate busted, 2kg of cannabis seized|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/drug-syndicate-busted-2kg/2299038.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=5 suspects arrested, more than S$158,000 of drugs seized in raid|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/5-suspects-arrested-more/2271676.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=1.2kg of heroin seized, 4 arrested in CNB operations|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/1-2kg-of-heroin-seized-4/2228106.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=1 kg of cannabis seized, 3 arrested|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/1-kg-of-cannabis-seized-3/2223532.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=87 suspected drug offenders arrested over 6-day operation|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/87-suspected-drug/2218326.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Drugs worth more than S$109,000 seized, four arrested|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/drugs-worth-more-than-s/2212634.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=107 suspects arrested in week-long operation in Geylang|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/107-suspects-arrested-in/2183972.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref>\n\n===Preventive drug education===\n[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|The Singapore embarkation card contains a warning to visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].

The Director of CNB reports to the Permanent Secretary and to the Minister of Home Affairs.\n\n=== Recruitment ===\nAll new Narcotics Officers must under go a period of residential training in the Home Team Academy (HTA) and pass all required tests.  Potential recruits can enter either as a Direct-Entry Inspector or a Direct-Entry Sergeant. Male recruits must be physically fit (i.e. pass the [[Individual physical proficiency test|IPPT]]). They must also have completed National Service with a Physical Employment Status of A or B1, which implies that they are the most medically fit within the male population.

CNB is responsible for coordinating all matters pertaining to drug eradication. Its current director is Mr. Ng Ser Song.\n\n==History==\nOn 19 October 1971, the [[Government of Singapore]] announced that a new and dedicated Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), would be set up within the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].  Then-Minister for Home Affairs [[Wong Lin Ken]] said, \"Such activities will be coordinated in the Central Narcotics Bureau. CNB also plans to build a capacity to educate the public in the dangers of drug abuse\".\n\t\nIn 1973, Singapore's government introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA)15 to deal with drug traffickers, pushers and addicts. The enactment of the MDA was intended to consolidate the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance 1951 (DDO) and Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1969 (DPMA), and secondly to more effectively deal with the worsening drug situation. New legislation was deemed to be necessary by then-Minister for Health and Home Affairs [[Chua Sian Chin]] in Parliament in 1973. \"The Dangerous Drugs Act (i.e DDO) was enacted about 21 years ago and the controls provided therein are grossly inadequate for the 70's, with the introduction of a host of new drugs of medical value if properly used.\" The need was exacerbated by Singapore's geographical location and development into a trading hub. The proximity to the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] is another oft-cited justification for tough anti-drug laws.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn November 1993, the \"Committee to Improve the Drug Situation in [[Singapore]]\" was set up to look into the drug situation and it recommended a total and integrated approach to deal with the drug problem. The four main anti-drug strategies are Preventive Drug Education, Rigorous Enforcement, Treatment and Rehabilitation for addicts, and Aftercare and Continued Rehabilitation for ex-addicts to reintegrate them into society. CNB was to be in charge of Rigorous Enforcement and Preventive Drug Education.\n\n==Functions==\n{{main|Capital punishment in Singapore}}{{main|Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)}}\n\n===Drug enforcement===\n\n==== Legal Powers ====\nAll Narcotics Officers are defined as an \"officer of the Bureau\" under the Misuse of Drugs Act. This empowers them to enter and search any place reasonably believed to contain controlled drugs without a warrant. They may also search a person or subject persons to urine or hair tests.\n\n==== Raids ====\nCNB conducts regular nationwide operations to conduct checks against drug abusers and ex-drug abusers who may have relapsed. Other than island-wide operations, CNB conducts operations targeted at specific areas where intelligence sources indicate that drug activity is taking place. CNB officers also work in closely with officers from other Home Team agencies such as the Singapore Police Force and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n<ref>{{cite news|title=Drug syndicate busted, 2kg of cannabis seized|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/drug-syndicate-busted-2kg/2299038.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=5 suspects arrested, more than S$158,000 of drugs seized in raid|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/5-suspects-arrested-more/2271676.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=1.2kg of heroin seized, 4 arrested in CNB operations|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/1-2kg-of-heroin-seized-4/2228106.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=1 kg of cannabis seized, 3 arrested|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/1-kg-of-cannabis-seized-3/2223532.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=87 suspected drug offenders arrested over 6-day operation|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/87-suspected-drug/2218326.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Drugs worth more than S$109,000 seized, four arrested|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/drugs-worth-more-than-s/2212634.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=107 suspects arrested in week-long operation in Geylang|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/107-suspects-arrested-in/2183972.html|accessdate=2 December 2015|agency=CNA|publisher=Channel News Asia}}</ref>\n\n===Preventive drug education===\n[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|The Singapore embarkation card contains a warning to visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].

They must also have completed National Service with a Physical Employment Status of A or B1, which implies that they are the most medically fit within the male population.

Because it is closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, the planet will probably rotate much more slowly than Earth; its day could be weeks or months long (see [[Exoplanet#Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt, and orbit|Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt, and orbit]]). This is reflected in its orbital distance, just outside of the point where the tidal interactions from its star would be strong enough to tidally lock it.\n\nKepler-442b's [[axial tilt]] (obliquity) is likely very small, in which case it would not have tilt-induced seasons as Earth and Mars do. Its orbit is probably close to circular so it will also lack eccentricity-induced seasonal changes like those of [[Mars]].\n\nOne review essay in 2015 concluded that Kepler-442b, along with the exoplanets [[Kepler-186f]] and [[Kepler-62f]], were likely the best candidates for being potentially habitable planets.<ref name=centauridreams>{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32470|title=A Review of the Best Habitable Planet Candidates|author=Paul Gilster, Andrew LePage|date=2015-01-30|publisher=Centauri Dreams, Tau Zero Foundation|accessdate=2015-07-24}}</ref>\n\nAlso, according to an index developed in 2015, Kepler-442b is even more habitable than [[Earth]]. Going to this index, Earth has a rating of 0.829, but Kepler-442b has a rating of 0.836. <ref>https://www.wired.co.uk/article/kepler-442b-more-habitable-earth</ref> This is uncertain because Kepler-442b's atmosphere and surface are unknown, but this would be possible.\n\n=== Superhabitable planet properties ===\n\nKepler-442b is also the most similar known case of a [[superhabitable planet]]. Qualities of Kepler-442b matching the superhabitable critera include:\n*K-type star, which is the proposed best type of the star for a habitable planet\n*Its size is 1.34 earth size and mass is 2.34 earth masses (a superhabitable planet would be 1.3 times earth's size and 2 earth masses)\n*It is in the center of the habitable zone\n\nKepler-442b doesn't meet all of the criteria, such as:\n*Age. Age of the ideal [[superhabitable planet]] would be between 4.5 and 7 billion years, but Kepler-442b is only 2 billion years old.\n*Temperature of a superhabitable planet would be about 25\u00b0C, but it is estimated to be -2.65\u00b0C.\n\nAdditionally, some details are currently unknown:\n*Kepler-442b may have oceans. A superhabitable planet would have shallow oceans.\n*Atmosphere of Kepler-442b is unknown. A superhabitable planet would have a thicker atmosphere than [[Earth]] and with higher level of oxygen.\n\n==Discovery and follow-up studies==\nIn 2009, [[NASA]]'s [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft was completing observing stars on its [[photometer]], the instrument it uses to detect [[transit method|transit]] events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed {{val|50,000}} stars in the [[Kepler Input Catalog]], including Kepler-442; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-442b occurred roughly every 113 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 113-day transits. The discovery, along with the notable planetary systems of the stars [[Kepler-438]] and [[Kepler-440]], were announced on 6 January 2015.<ref name=\"Keplercitepaper\" />\n\nAt nearly {{convert|342|pc|ly|disp=flip}} distant, Kepler-442b is too remote and its star too far for current telescopes or the next generation of planned telescopes to determine its mass or whether it has an atmosphere. The Kepler spacecraft focused on a single small region of the sky but next-generation planet-hunting space telescopes, such as [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] and [[CHEOPS]], will examine nearby stars throughout the sky.\n\nNearby stars with planets can then be studied by the upcoming [[James Webb Space Telescope]] and future large ground-based telescopes to analyze atmospheres, determine masses and infer compositions. Additionally the [[Square Kilometer Array]] would significantly improve radio observations over the [[Arecibo Observatory]] and [[Green Bank Telescope]].<ref name=\"arxiv=1302.0845v1\">{{cite journal |first1=Andrew P.V. |last1=Siemion |first2=Paul  |last2=Demorest |first3=Eric |last3=Korpela |first4=Ron J. |last4=Maddalena |first5=Dan |last5=Werthimer |first6=Jeff |last6=Cobb |first7=Glen |last7=Langston |first8=Matt |last8=Lebofsky |first9=Geoffrey W. |last9=Marcy | first10=Jill |last10=Tarter |authorlink1=Andrew Siemion |title=A 1.1 to 1.9 GHz SETI Survey of the Kepler Field: I.

Because it is closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, the planet will probably rotate much more slowly than Earth; its day could be weeks or months long (see [[Exoplanet#Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt, and orbit|Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt, and orbit]]). This is reflected in its orbital distance, just outside of the point where the tidal interactions from its star would be strong enough to tidally lock it.\n\nKepler-442b's [[axial tilt]] (obliquity) is likely very small, in which case it would not have tilt-induced seasons as Earth and Mars do. Its orbit is probably close to circular so it will also lack eccentricity-induced seasonal changes like those of [[Mars]].\n\nOne review essay in 2015 concluded that Kepler-442b, along with the exoplanets [[Kepler-186f]] and [[Kepler-62f]], were likely the best candidates for being potentially habitable planets.<ref name=centauridreams>{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32470|title=A Review of the Best Habitable Planet Candidates|author=Paul Gilster, Andrew LePage|date=2015-01-30|publisher=Centauri Dreams, Tau Zero Foundation|accessdate=2015-07-24}}</ref>\n\nAlso, according to an index developed in 2015, Kepler-442b is even more habitable than [[Earth]]. Going to this index, Earth has a rating of 0.829, but Kepler-442b has a rating of 0.836. <ref>https://www.wired.co.uk/article/kepler-442b-more-habitable-earth</ref> This is uncertain because Kepler-442b's atmosphere and surface are unknown, but this would be possible.\n\n=== Superhabitable planet properties ===\n\nKepler-442b is also the most similar known case of a [[superhabitable planet]]. Qualities of Kepler-442b matching the superhabitable critera include:\n*K-type star, which is the proposed best type of the star for a habitable planet\n*Its size is 1.34 earth size and mass is 2.34 earth masses (a superhabitable planet would be 1.3 times earth's size and 2 earth masses)\n*It is in the center of the habitable zone\n\nKepler-442b doesn't meet all of the criteria, such as:\n*Age. Age of the ideal [[superhabitable planet]] would be between 4.5 and 7 billion years, but Kepler-442b is only 2 billion years old.\n*Temperature of a superhabitable planet would be about 25\u00b0C, but it is estimated to be -2.65\u00b0C.\n\nAdditionally, some details are currently unknown:\n*Kepler-442b may have oceans. A superhabitable planet would have shallow oceans.\n*Atmosphere of Kepler-442b is unknown. A superhabitable planet would have a thicker atmosphere than [[Earth]] and with higher level of oxygen.\n\n==Discovery and follow-up studies==\nIn 2009, [[NASA]]'s [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft was completing observing stars on its [[photometer]], the instrument it uses to detect [[transit method|transit]] events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed {{val|50,000}} stars in the [[Kepler Input Catalog]], including Kepler-442; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-442b occurred roughly every 113 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 113-day transits. The discovery, along with the notable planetary systems of the stars [[Kepler-438]] and [[Kepler-440]], were announced on 6 January 2015.<ref name=\"Keplercitepaper\" />\n\nAt nearly {{convert|342|pc|ly|disp=flip}} distant, Kepler-442b is too remote and its star too far for current telescopes or the next generation of planned telescopes to determine its mass or whether it has an atmosphere. The Kepler spacecraft focused on a single small region of the sky but next-generation planet-hunting space telescopes, such as [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] and [[CHEOPS]], will examine nearby stars throughout the sky.\n\nNearby stars with planets can then be studied by the upcoming [[James Webb Space Telescope]] and future large ground-based telescopes to analyze atmospheres, determine masses and infer compositions. Additionally the [[Square Kilometer Array]] would significantly improve radio observations over the [[Arecibo Observatory]] and [[Green Bank Telescope]].<ref name=\"arxiv=1302.0845v1\">{{cite journal |first1=Andrew P.V. |last1=Siemion |first2=Paul  |last2=Demorest |first3=Eric |last3=Korpela |first4=Ron J. |last4=Maddalena |first5=Dan |last5=Werthimer |first6=Jeff |last6=Cobb |first7=Glen |last7=Langston |first8=Matt |last8=Lebofsky |first9=Geoffrey W. |last9=Marcy | first10=Jill |last10=Tarter |authorlink1=Andrew Siemion |title=A 1.1 to 1.9 GHz SETI Survey of the Kepler Field: I.

{"title_page": "SAMO", "text_new": "{{About|the graffiti tag||Samo (disambiguation)}}\n'''SAMO''' is a [[graffiti]] tag used on the streets of [[New York City]] from 1977 to early 1980. It accompanied short phrases, in turns poetic and sarcastic, mainly painted on the streets of downtown [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe tag, written with a [[copyright symbol]] as \"SAMO\u00a9\", and pronounced Same-Oh<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHrZbS1yjmc</ref> has been primarily associated with the artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], but was developed mainly as a collaboration between Basquiat and Al Diaz, with help from a few friends. Diaz had previously been part of the New York [[graffiti]] scene (he knew the first writer of sayings, FLINT.i..For Those Who Dare when they both attended the High School of Art and Design) using the tag \"Bomb I\". Later Basquiat took on the tag himself, creating some non-graffiti work on paper and canvas using that tag, just before and after killing off the SAMO graffiti by painting \"SAMO\u00a9 IS DEAD\" around the streets of downtown in early 1980.\n\n==History==\nBasquiat claims the name was first developed in a [[Effects of cannabis|stoned]] conversation with high school friend Al Diaz, calling the [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] they smoked \"the same old crap,\" then shortening the phrase to \"Same Old\", then \"SAMO\".<ref name=\"voice\">Faflick, Philip. \"The SAMO Graffiti.. Boosh Wah or CIA?\" ''Village Voice'', December 11, 1978.</ref> The character of SAMO was first developed by Basquiat and Diaz, while they were fellow students at [[City As School]] high school. Basquiat took the lead in creating a character called SAMO, selling a false religion, in [[comics]] made in high school. The concept was further developed in a [[Drama therapy|theatre-as-therapy]] course in [[Upper Manhattan]] (called \"Family Life\") that was used by the trio as part of the City As School program. \"Jean started elaborating on the idea and I began putting my thoughts into it,\" remembered Diaz.<ref>Hager, Steve. ''Art After Midnight: The East Village Scene''. St. Matins Press, 1986. page 42.</ref> Basquiat, Diaz, Shannon Dawson and Matt Kelly worked on a comic style endorsement of the false religion, photocopied as a pamphlet \"Based on an original concept by Jean Basquiat and Al Diaz.\"<ref name=\"Hoban\">Hoban, Phoebe. ''Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art'' (2nd ed.), Penguin Books, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe City As School 1977/78 Yearbook includes a photo of the SAMO graffiti: SAMO@ AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PLASTIC FOOD STANDS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n\"It started ... as a private joke and then grew\" Diaz and Basquiat would later tell ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in an interview.<ref name=\"voice\" /> They took the joke out of the school, giving out small stickers with SAMO aphorisms or the SAMO pamphlet on paper on the [[Subway (rail)|subway]], and writing down the phrases with marker pens as graffiti, often with an ironic [[copyright symbol]] attached. In 1977, while they were still students, Basquiat and Diaz started to put up the first SAMO\u00a9 Graffiti in Manhattan.\n\n[[Henry Flynt]] claims that Shannon Dawson (later of the band [[Konk (band)|Konk]]) played a major part in the trio of writers in the first wave SAMO graffiti writers,<ref name=\"Flynt\">Flynt, Henry. \"The SAMO\u00a9 Graffiti\" http://www.henryflynt.org/overviews/samo.htm</ref> but most accounts, including those of Basquiat, claim the writing was done by the duo of Basquiat and Diaz.<ref name=\"Hoban\" /> When asked about other people, Basquiat said \"No, No, it was me and Al Diaz.\"<ref name=\"ArtNewYork\">Basquiat, Jean-Michel. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2013 An Interview'' (ART / New York No. 30A) video. 1998. 34 mins. Interview by Marc Miller.</ref> Basquiat remembers writing the tag with marker on the subway on the way back from Manhattan to [[Brooklyn]], where he lived as a high school student, but unlike most of the graffiti taggers of the time, SAMO was primarily written on walls, not subway trains.\n\nAl Diaz graduated from City As School in 1978, and Basquiat dropped out of school and left his father's home in Brooklyn to spend time homeless and living with friends in Manhattan in June of that year. From that point the SAMO graffiti took off in [[Lower Manhattan]]. [[SoHo]], parts of [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and the area immediately around the [[School of Visual Arts]] were prime targets for the Graffiti.\n\nThe ''SoHo News'' noticed the graffiti, and published a few pictures of the idiomatic phrases with a query about who had done them. According to Henry Flynt, who photographed much of the graffiti, \"The collective graffiti employed anonymity to seem corporate and engulfing. The tone was utterly different from the morose and abject tone of Basquiat's solo work. The implication was that SAMO\u00a9 was a drug that could solve all problems. SOHO, the art world, and Yuppies were satirized with Olympian wit.\".<ref name=\"Flynt\" />\n\nDiaz had been a young and early member of the New York graffiti scene of the 1970s, and his tag \"Bomb I\" was included in [[Norman Mailer]]'s famous book The ''Faith of Graffiti'' in 1974.<ref>Mailer, Norman. ''The Faith of Graffiti''(photography by Mervyn Kurlansky & Jon Naar) New York: Praeger Publishers, 1974. Pictures available at http://www.ekosystem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3419</ref>\n\nBy late 1978 the two were using spray paint to quickly get up larger phrases. \"We would take turns coming up with the sayings\" said Al Diaz.<ref name=\"Hoban\" /> Many of these retained the same ideas as the comic strip SAMO of high school:\n\n: SAMO\u00a9 SAVES IDIOTS AND GONZOIDS...\n: SAMO\u00a9...4 MASS MEDIA MINDWASH\n\nBut they also used it to make critical comments towards the art scene in SoHo and college students comfortably studying in art schools:\n\n: SAMO\u00a9...4 THE SO-CALLED AVANT-GARDE\n: SAMO as an alternative 2 playing art with the \u2018[[radical chic]]' sect on Daddy's$funds\n\nSome of the comments seemed to look critically at consumer society as a whole:\n\n: MICROWAVE & VIDEO X-SISTANCE\n: \"BIG-MAC\" CERTIFICATE\"\n: FOR X-MASS...\n: SAMO\u00a9\n\nOne biographer noted that \"while some of the phrases might seem political, none of them were simple propaganda slogans. Some were outright surrealist, or looked like fragments of poetry.\"<ref name=\"Fretz\">Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Biography''. Greenwood Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\nPeople began to notice the graffiti appearing on walls all over downtown, recognizing the strange phrases, but no one knew who did them. Basquiat and Diaz claimed they could sometimes do thirty on a busy day.<ref name=\"voice\" /> Sometimes the SAMO\u00a9 graffiti would refer to its own spread, as in a large, mural sized, multiple choice graffiti:\n\n: WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING IS OMNIPRESENT?\n: [ ] LEE HARVEY OSWALD\n: [ ] COCA-COLA LOGO\n: [ ] GENERAL MELONRY\n: [ ] SAMO\u00a9...\n\nArt critic [[Jeffrey Deitch]] called it \"disjointed street poetry\" and remembered that \"Back in the late seventies, you couldn't go anywhere interesting in Lower Manhattan without noticing that someone named SAMO had been there first.\"<ref>Deitch, Jeffrey. \"Jean-Michel Basquiat at Annina Nosei (review)\" ''Flash Art'', May 1982.</ref>\n\nLater Basquiat would look back on this as just \"Teenage stuff. We'd just drink [[Ballantine Ale]] all the time and write stuff and throw bottles ... just teenage stuff\" he told an interviews asking about SAMO.<ref name=\"ArtNewYork\" /> \"Samo was sophomoric. Same old shit.\" he explained to [[Anthony Haden-Guest]]. \"It was supposed to be a [[logo]], like [[Pepsi]].\".<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\">Haden-Guest, Anthony. ''True Colors: The Real Life of the Art World''. Atlantic Monthly Press, 1998. https://books.google.com/books?id=ACMbY9yahNsC&printsec=frontcover</ref>\n\nHowever, Diaz recognized the original intelligence in this work. \"The stuff you see on the subways now is inane. Scribbled. SAMO was like a refresher course because there's some kind of statement being made. It's not just ego graffiti.\"<ref name=\"voice\" />\n\nIn 1979, Henry Flynt began taking photos of the SAMO graffiti, not knowing who had done them. After first exhibiting the photos he got to know Al Diaz, and Shannon Dawson who helped him uncover who did which tag. He has published many of the SAMO graffiti photos on the internet.<ref name=\"Flynt\" />\n\nBy 1979 Basquiat had started to do graffiti on his own. [[Keith Haring]] had been following the SAMO graffiti and finally met Basquiat in 1979. He never mentioned Al Diaz. Haring remembers: \"I still hadn't met Jean-Michel\u2014I had only heard of him. Well, one day a kid came up to me just as I was going into [[School of Visual Arts|SVA]], and he asked if I could walk him through, past the security guard. He wanted to get inside the school. I said \"sure\" and we walked through. I disappeared into a class. When I came out an hour later, I noticed there were all these fresh SAMO poems and tags in places they hadn't been an hour ago. I put two and two together and realized that the person I had walked through was Basquiat.\" \"Later that day, I ran into him again and I asked him if the tags at SVA were his, and he said yes\" and the two became friends.<ref>Haring, Keith. ''The Keith Haring Journals''. Introduction by [[Robert Farris Thompson]]; preface by [[David Hockney]]. New York: Viking, c. 1996.</ref> Basquiat then started hanging around with Haring and other SVA students [[Kenny Scharf]] and [[John Sex]]. Scharf said that in 1979 he would go out on forays doing wall drawings with Basquiat. \"I would do [[The Jetsons|Jetson]] and [[The Flintstones|Flintstone]] heads and have them speaking in some foreign tongue\" while Basquiat did his SAMO thing.<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\" /> Keith Haring would also join Basquiat in outdoor [[graffiti|tagging]].\n\nWhereas Diaz always wanted his graffiti to remain anonymous, Basquiat craved the publicity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAlthough Basquiat was to say there was \"no ambition\" in the work at all, it is striking to see the places the SAMO graffiti were targeted: around the SoHo galleries, and even up at the School of Visual Arts. [[Glenn O'Brien]] notes that \"Ninety percent of SAMO graffiti was executed in the heart of the art neighborhood. He kind of stuck to SoHo ... So that it was sort of advertising for himself.\"<ref>Deitch J, Cortez D, and O'Brien, G. (eds.) ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: 1981: the Studio of the Street'', Charta, 2007.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of Basquiat's life Becky Johnson asked him \"Did you know that you were going to stop doing stuff on walls and start painting on canvas?\" He answered \"No. I was more interested in attacking the gallery circuit at that time, I didn't think about making paintings, I just thought about making fun of the ones that were in there.\"<ref>''A Conversation with Basquiat'' Director Tamara Davis. Becky Johnson, interviewer. Documentary Short. USA. 2006. 21 mins. Distributed by Arthouse films, New York</ref>  While this was true of Basquiat and Diaz in the early SAMO graffiti, soon Basquiat was trying to cash in on his graffiti fame and make the transition to the gallery world. Looking at his friends from SVA, Haring, Scharff and Basquiat would all make the transition from graffiti to gallery about the same time, but only Basquiat completely changed his style in order to do it.\n\n==Death==\nIn early 1980, Diaz and Basquiat had a falling out. Soon Basquiat was writing \"SAMO IS DEAD\" all over the streets of downtown. Some of the old phrases were still up at the time and written over with the news. As Jean was to put it later: \"I wrote SAMO IS DEAD all over the place. And I started painting\"<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\" />\n\nAfter noticing the \"SAMO\u00a9 IS DEAD\" phrases, Keith Haring held a mock wake for SAMO at his [[Club 57 (nightclub)|Club 57]].\n\nHowever, there is not such a clean break between the collective SAMO\u00a9 and the solo Basquiat. Around 1980 Basquiat began to take over the SAMO name, before killing it off. In the early 1980s Basquiat was often a guest on Glenn O'Brien's underground cable TV talk show \"[[TV Party]],\" where he was introduced as the person behind SAMO. Some of Basquiat's early drawings, and paintings on canvas (79-80) were signed SAMO. His first one-person gallery show ( May 23 \u2013 June 20, 1981 in [[Modena]], [[Italy]]) was even billed as an exhibition of paintings by \"SAMO.\" His early 1981 painting on canvas \"Cadillac Moon\" has the inscription in the lower left \"SAMO\u00a9\" crossed out, and the names \"AARON\" (for [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]]), and \"JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT\" written in instead. Many of Basquiat's paintings and drawings of 1980/81 include phrases originally used in the SAMO collaboration, along with others (like MILK\u00a9) in the same style. Such phrases cropped up occasionally for the rest of his career.<ref name=\"Fretz\" />\n\nAs well known and omnipresent as the graffiti were, they gradually disappeared from the street, either being painted over as common vandalism, or carefully taken down for resale when Basquiat's art began to command high prices. In addition to [[Henry Flynt]], [[Peter Moore (photographer)|Peter Moore]], [[Martha Cooper]], and Glenn O'Brien, are responsible for the few photos we have to document the original SAMO graffiti (''The SoHo News'' photos have been lost). Flynt, an artist and musician loosely connected to [[Fluxus]] and [[Neo-Dada]] art movements, photographed much of the graffiti, starting in 1979 without knowing who the graffitists were. When Flynt first exhibited his portfolio he got to know Diaz and Dawson who helped him confirm the authorship of every graffito. He has published many of these photos on the web.<ref name=\"Flynt\" /> For the movie ''New York Beat'' (later released as ''[[Downtown 81]]'') Basquiat was persuaded to walk through the streets of the [[Lower East Side]] recreating for the camera much of his earlier graffiti.<ref>Downtown 81.

It accompanied short phrases, in turns poetic and sarcastic, mainly painted on the streets of downtown [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe tag, written with a [[copyright symbol]] as \"SAMO\u00a9\", and pronounced Same-Oh<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHrZbS1yjmc</ref> has been primarily associated with the artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], but was developed mainly as a collaboration between Basquiat and Al Diaz, with help from a few friends. Diaz had previously been part of the New York [[graffiti]] scene (he knew the first writer of sayings, FLINT.i..For Those Who Dare when they both attended the High School of Art and Design) using the tag \"Bomb I\". Later Basquiat took on the tag himself, creating some non-graffiti work on paper and canvas using that tag, just before and after killing off the SAMO graffiti by painting \"SAMO\u00a9 IS DEAD\" around the streets of downtown in early 1980.\n\n==History==\nBasquiat claims the name was first developed in a [[Effects of cannabis|stoned]] conversation with high school friend Al Diaz, calling the [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] they smoked \"the same old crap,\" then shortening the phrase to \"Same Old\", then \"SAMO\".<ref name=\"voice\">Faflick, Philip. \"The SAMO Graffiti.. Boosh Wah or CIA?\" ''Village Voice'', December 11, 1978.</ref> The character of SAMO was first developed by Basquiat and Diaz, while they were fellow students at [[City As School]] high school. Basquiat took the lead in creating a character called SAMO, selling a false religion, in [[comics]] made in high school. The concept was further developed in a [[Drama therapy|theatre-as-therapy]] course in [[Upper Manhattan]] (called \"Family Life\") that was used by the trio as part of the City As School program. \"Jean started elaborating on the idea and I began putting my thoughts into it,\" remembered Diaz.<ref>Hager, Steve. ''Art After Midnight: The East Village Scene''. St. Matins Press, 1986. page 42.</ref> Basquiat, Diaz, Shannon Dawson and Matt Kelly worked on a comic style endorsement of the false religion, photocopied as a pamphlet \"Based on an original concept by Jean Basquiat and Al Diaz.\"<ref name=\"Hoban\">Hoban, Phoebe.

In 1977, while they were still students, Basquiat and Diaz started to put up the first SAMO\u00a9 Graffiti in Manhattan.\n\n[[Henry Flynt]] claims that Shannon Dawson (later of the band [[Konk (band)|Konk]]) played a major part in the trio of writers in the first wave SAMO graffiti writers,<ref name=\"Flynt\">Flynt, Henry. \"The SAMO\u00a9 Graffiti\" http://www.henryflynt.org/overviews/samo.htm</ref> but most accounts, including those of Basquiat, claim the writing was done by the duo of Basquiat and Diaz.<ref name=\"Hoban\" /> When asked about other people, Basquiat said \"No, No, it was me and Al Diaz.\"<ref name=\"ArtNewYork\">Basquiat, Jean-Michel. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2013 An Interview'' (ART / New York No. 30A) video. 1998. 34 mins. Interview by Marc Miller.</ref> Basquiat remembers writing the tag with marker on the subway on the way back from Manhattan to [[Brooklyn]], where he lived as a high school student, but unlike most of the graffiti taggers of the time, SAMO was primarily written on walls, not subway trains.\n\nAl Diaz graduated from City As School in 1978, and Basquiat dropped out of school and left his father's home in Brooklyn to spend time homeless and living with friends in Manhattan in June of that year. From that point the SAMO graffiti took off in [[Lower Manhattan]]. [[SoHo]], parts of [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and the area immediately around the [[School of Visual Arts]] were prime targets for the Graffiti.\n\nThe ''SoHo News'' noticed the graffiti, and published a few pictures of the idiomatic phrases with a query about who had done them. According to Henry Flynt, who photographed much of the graffiti, \"The collective graffiti employed anonymity to seem corporate and engulfing. The tone was utterly different from the morose and abject tone of Basquiat's solo work. The implication was that SAMO\u00a9 was a drug that could solve all problems. SOHO, the art world, and Yuppies were satirized with Olympian wit.\".<ref name=\"Flynt\" />\n\nDiaz had been a young and early member of the New York graffiti scene of the 1970s, and his tag \"Bomb I\" was included in [[Norman Mailer]]'s famous book The ''Faith of Graffiti'' in 1974.<ref>Mailer, Norman. ''The Faith of Graffiti''(photography by Mervyn Kurlansky & Jon Naar) New York: Praeger Publishers, 1974. Pictures available at http://www.ekosystem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3419</ref>\n\nBy late 1978 the two were using spray paint to quickly get up larger phrases. \"We would take turns coming up with the sayings\" said Al Diaz.<ref name=\"Hoban\" /> Many of these retained the same ideas as the comic strip SAMO of high school:\n\n: SAMO\u00a9 SAVES IDIOTS AND GONZOIDS...\n: SAMO\u00a9...4 MASS MEDIA MINDWASH\n\nBut they also used it to make critical comments towards the art scene in SoHo and college students comfortably studying in art schools:\n\n: SAMO\u00a9...4 THE SO-CALLED AVANT-GARDE\n: SAMO as an alternative 2 playing art with the \u2018[[radical chic]]' sect on Daddy's$funds\n\nSome of the comments seemed to look critically at consumer society as a whole:\n\n: MICROWAVE & VIDEO X-SISTANCE\n: \"BIG-MAC\" CERTIFICATE\"\n: FOR X-MASS...\n: SAMO\u00a9\n\nOne biographer noted that \"while some of the phrases might seem political, none of them were simple propaganda slogans. Some were outright surrealist, or looked like fragments of poetry.\"<ref name=\"Fretz\">Fretz, Eric. ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: A Biography''. Greenwood Press, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\nPeople began to notice the graffiti appearing on walls all over downtown, recognizing the strange phrases, but no one knew who did them. Basquiat and Diaz claimed they could sometimes do thirty on a busy day.<ref name=\"voice\" /> Sometimes the SAMO\u00a9 graffiti would refer to its own spread, as in a large, mural sized, multiple choice graffiti:\n\n: WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING IS OMNIPRESENT?\n: [ ] LEE HARVEY OSWALD\n: [ ] COCA-COLA LOGO\n: [ ] GENERAL MELONRY\n: [ ] SAMO\u00a9...\n\nArt critic [[Jeffrey Deitch]] called it \"disjointed street poetry\" and remembered that \"Back in the late seventies, you couldn't go anywhere interesting in Lower Manhattan without noticing that someone named SAMO had been there first.\"<ref>Deitch, Jeffrey. \"Jean-Michel Basquiat at Annina Nosei (review)\" ''Flash Art'', May 1982.</ref>\n\nLater Basquiat would look back on this as just \"Teenage stuff. We'd just drink [[Ballantine Ale]] all the time and write stuff and throw bottles ... just teenage stuff\" he told an interviews asking about SAMO.<ref name=\"ArtNewYork\" /> \"Samo was sophomoric. Same old shit.\" he explained to [[Anthony Haden-Guest]]. \"It was supposed to be a [[logo]], like [[Pepsi]].\".<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\">Haden-Guest, Anthony. ''True Colors: The Real Life of the Art World''. Atlantic Monthly Press, 1998. https://books.google.com/books?id=ACMbY9yahNsC&printsec=frontcover</ref>\n\nHowever, Diaz recognized the original intelligence in this work. \"The stuff you see on the subways now is inane. Scribbled. SAMO was like a refresher course because there's some kind of statement being made. It's not just ego graffiti.\"<ref name=\"voice\" />\n\nIn 1979, Henry Flynt began taking photos of the SAMO graffiti, not knowing who had done them. After first exhibiting the photos he got to know Al Diaz, and Shannon Dawson who helped him uncover who did which tag. He has published many of the SAMO graffiti photos on the internet.<ref name=\"Flynt\" />\n\nBy 1979 Basquiat had started to do graffiti on his own. [[Keith Haring]] had been following the SAMO graffiti and finally met Basquiat in 1979. He never mentioned Al Diaz. Haring remembers: \"I still hadn't met Jean-Michel\u2014I had only heard of him. Well, one day a kid came up to me just as I was going into [[School of Visual Arts|SVA]], and he asked if I could walk him through, past the security guard. He wanted to get inside the school. I said \"sure\" and we walked through. I disappeared into a class. When I came out an hour later, I noticed there were all these fresh SAMO poems and tags in places they hadn't been an hour ago. I put two and two together and realized that the person I had walked through was Basquiat.\" \"Later that day, I ran into him again and I asked him if the tags at SVA were his, and he said yes\" and the two became friends.<ref>Haring, Keith. ''The Keith Haring Journals''. Introduction by [[Robert Farris Thompson]]; preface by [[David Hockney]]. New York: Viking, c. 1996.</ref> Basquiat then started hanging around with Haring and other SVA students [[Kenny Scharf]] and [[John Sex]]. Scharf said that in 1979 he would go out on forays doing wall drawings with Basquiat. \"I would do [[The Jetsons|Jetson]] and [[The Flintstones|Flintstone]] heads and have them speaking in some foreign tongue\" while Basquiat did his SAMO thing.<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\" /> Keith Haring would also join Basquiat in outdoor [[graffiti|tagging]].\n\nWhereas Diaz always wanted his graffiti to remain anonymous, Basquiat craved the publicity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAlthough Basquiat was to say there was \"no ambition\" in the work at all, it is striking to see the places the SAMO graffiti were targeted: around the SoHo galleries, and even up at the School of Visual Arts. [[Glenn O'Brien]] notes that \"Ninety percent of SAMO graffiti was executed in the heart of the art neighborhood. He kind of stuck to SoHo ... So that it was sort of advertising for himself.\"<ref>Deitch J, Cortez D, and O'Brien, G. (eds.) ''Jean-Michel Basquiat: 1981: the Studio of the Street'', Charta, 2007.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of Basquiat's life Becky Johnson asked him \"Did you know that you were going to stop doing stuff on walls and start painting on canvas?\" He answered \"No. I was more interested in attacking the gallery circuit at that time, I didn't think about making paintings, I just thought about making fun of the ones that were in there.\"<ref>''A Conversation with Basquiat'' Director Tamara Davis. Becky Johnson, interviewer. Documentary Short. USA. 2006. 21 mins. Distributed by Arthouse films, New York</ref>  While this was true of Basquiat and Diaz in the early SAMO graffiti, soon Basquiat was trying to cash in on his graffiti fame and make the transition to the gallery world. Looking at his friends from SVA, Haring, Scharff and Basquiat would all make the transition from graffiti to gallery about the same time, but only Basquiat completely changed his style in order to do it.\n\n==Death==\nIn early 1980, Diaz and Basquiat had a falling out. Soon Basquiat was writing \"SAMO IS DEAD\" all over the streets of downtown. Some of the old phrases were still up at the time and written over with the news. As Jean was to put it later: \"I wrote SAMO IS DEAD all over the place. And I started painting\"<ref name=\"Haden-Guest\" />\n\nAfter noticing the \"SAMO\u00a9 IS DEAD\" phrases, Keith Haring held a mock wake for SAMO at his [[Club 57 (nightclub)|Club 57]].\n\nHowever, there is not such a clean break between the collective SAMO\u00a9 and the solo Basquiat. Around 1980 Basquiat began to take over the SAMO name, before killing it off. In the early 1980s Basquiat was often a guest on Glenn O'Brien's underground cable TV talk show \"[[TV Party]],\" where he was introduced as the person behind SAMO. Some of Basquiat's early drawings, and paintings on canvas (79-80) were signed SAMO. His first one-person gallery show ( May 23 \u2013 June 20, 1981 in [[Modena]], [[Italy]]) was even billed as an exhibition of paintings by \"SAMO.\" His early 1981 painting on canvas \"Cadillac Moon\" has the inscription in the lower left \"SAMO\u00a9\" crossed out, and the names \"AARON\" (for [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]]), and \"JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT\" written in instead. Many of Basquiat's paintings and drawings of 1980/81 include phrases originally used in the SAMO collaboration, along with others (like MILK\u00a9) in the same style. Such phrases cropped up occasionally for the rest of his career.<ref name=\"Fretz\" />\n\nAs well known and omnipresent as the graffiti were, they gradually disappeared from the street, either being painted over as common vandalism, or carefully taken down for resale when Basquiat's art began to command high prices. In addition to [[Henry Flynt]], [[Peter Moore (photographer)|Peter Moore]], [[Martha Cooper]], and Glenn O'Brien, are responsible for the few photos we have to document the original SAMO graffiti (''The SoHo News'' photos have been lost). Flynt, an artist and musician loosely connected to [[Fluxus]] and [[Neo-Dada]] art movements, photographed much of the graffiti, starting in 1979 without knowing who the graffitists were. When Flynt first exhibited his portfolio he got to know Diaz and Dawson who helped him confirm the authorship of every graffito. He has published many of these photos on the web.<ref name=\"Flynt\" /> For the movie ''New York Beat'' (later released as ''[[Downtown 81]]'') Basquiat was persuaded to walk through the streets of the [[Lower East Side]] recreating for the camera much of his earlier graffiti.<ref>Downtown 81. Edo Bertoglio, [[Maripol]], and Glenn O'Brien, Zeitgeist Films, 2001.</ref> These include \"PAY FOR SOUP / BUILD A FORT / SET THAT ON FIRE\" and\n\n: THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE\n: BOW LIKE THIS WITH\n: THE BIG MONEY ALL\n: CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET\n\nThese ''Downtown 81'' images are the most common illustrations of Jean-Michel Basquiat's graffiti, but were not signed \"SAMO\" and differ in style from the real SAMO graffiti.\n\nThe SAMO graffiti is still being cited by contemporary street artists.<ref>Thompson, Margot. ''American Graffiti'', Parkstone Press, 2009.</ref>\n\n== Same Old Gallery ==\nTo mark the 30th anniversary of Basquiat\u2019s death on August 12, 2018, Adrian Wilson conceived a commemorative tribute, to which Al Diaz added a SAMO tag <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boweryboogie.com/2018/08/on-the-30th-anniversary-of-his-death-basquiat-gets-tribute-from-al-diaz-on-great-jones/|title=On the 30th Anniversary of his Death, Basquiat Gets Tribute from Al Diaz on Great Jones|date=2018-08-13|website=Bowery Boogie|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref> on the front gates of his former home and studio at, 57 Great Jones Street, New York.

These works are far from typical ''verismo'' subject matter, yet they are written in the same general musical style as his more quintessential veristic subjects.

Opera singers adapted to the demands of the \u201cnew\u201d style. The most extreme exponents of ''verismo'' vocalism sang habitually in a vociferous fashion, were focusing on the passionate aspect of music. They would 'beef up' the timbre of their voices, use excessive amounts of vocal fold mass on their top notes, and often employ a conspicuous [[vibrato]] in order to accentuate the emotionalism of their ardent interpretations (this kind of proper \u201cchiaroscuro\u201d technique singing, which promised a great longevity of the voice, that a lot of preceding singers used up to this point in time). \n\nSome prominent practitioners of ''verismo'' singing during the movement's Italian lifespan (circa 1890 to circa 1930) include the sopranos [[Eugenia Burzio]], [[Lina Bruna Rasa]] and Bianca Scacciati, the tenors [[Aureliano Pertile]], [[Cesar Vezzani]] and Amadeo Bassi, and the baritones [[Mario Sammarco]] and [[Eugenio Giraldoni]]. Their method of singing can be sampled on numerous 78-rpm [[Gramophone record|gramophone]] recordings.\n\nSuch great early-20th century international operatic stars as [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Rosa Ponselle]] and [[Titta Ruffo]] developed vocal techniques which harmoniously managed to combine fundamental bel canto precepts with a more 'modern', straightforward mode of ripe-toned singing when delivering ''verismo'' music, and their example has influenced operatic performers down to this day (see Scott).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|opera}}\n*[[Verismo (literature)]]\n*[[Verismo (painting)]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Opera genres}}\n\n[[Category:Opera genres]]\n[[Category:Italian opera terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}{{other uses}}\n[[File:GiacomoPuccini.jpg|thumb|[[Giacomo Puccini]], one of the composers most closely associated with ''verismo''.]]\nIn [[opera]], '''''verismo''''' ({{langnf||Italian|\"realism\"}}, from {{lang|it|vero}}, meaning \"true\") was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]].\n''Verismo'' as an operatic genre had its origins in an [[Verismo (literature)|Italian literary movement of the same name]].

In addition to referring to operas written in a realistic style, the term may also be used more broadly to refer to the entire output of the composers of the ''[[giovane scuola]]'' (\"young school\"), the generation of composers who were active in Italy during the period that the ''verismo'' style was created.<ref name=\"The Autumn\">{{cite book|last=Mallach|first=Alan|title=The Autumn of Italian Opera: From Verismo to Modernism, 1890 - 1915|year=2007|publisher=Northeastern University Press|location=Lebanon, NH |pages= 42 et seq.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cio' che prepara e pensa Umberto Giordano|newspaper=La Stampa|date=February 6, 1905}}. ''Verismo'' composer Umberto Giordano told an interviewer in 1905: \"The meaning of these words (vero and ''verismo'') needs to be defined once and for all\" (\"Bisognerebbe adunque definire una buona volta il valore di questi vocaboli.\")</ref> One author (Alan Mallach) has proposed the term \"plebeian opera\" to refer to operas that adhere to the contemporary and realistic subject matter for which the term ''verismo'' was originally coined. At the same time, Mallach questions the value of using a term such as ''verismo'', which is supposedly descriptive of the subject and style of works, simply to identify an entire generation's music-dramatic output.<ref name=\"The Autumn3\">{{cite book|last = Mallach|first = Alan|title = The Autumn of Italian Opera: From Verismo to Modernism, 1890\u20131915|year = 2007|publisher = Northeastern University Press|location = Lebanon, NH |pages=42 et seq.}}</ref> For most of the composers associated with ''verismo'', traditionally veristic subjects accounted for only some of their operas. For instance, Mascagni wrote a pastoral comedy (''[[L'amico Fritz]]''), a symbolist work set in Japan (''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]''), and a couple of medieval romances (''[[Isabeau]]'' and ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]''). These works are far from typical ''verismo'' subject matter, yet they are written in the same general musical style as his more quintessential veristic subjects. In addition, there is disagreement among musicologists as to which operas are ''verismo'' operas, and which are not. (Non-Italian operas are generally excluded). Giordano's ''[[Andrea Ch\u00e9nier]]'', Cilea's ''[[Adriana Lecouvreur]]'', Mascagni's ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', Leoncavallo's ''[[Pagliacci]]'',<ref name=\"The Autumn3\" /> and Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'' and ''[[Il tabarro]]''<ref name=\"Fisher, ed.2\">{{cite book|last = Fisher|first = edited by Burton D.|title = Puccini's IL TRITTICO|year = 2003|publisher = Opera Journeys Pub.|location = Miami|isbn = 0-9771455-6-5}}</ref> are operas to which the term ''verismo'' is applied with little or no dispute.

Opera singers adapted to the demands of the \u201cnew\u201d style. The most extreme exponents of ''verismo'' vocalism sang habitually in a vociferous fashion, were focusing on the passionate aspect of music. They would 'beef up' the timbre of their voices, use excessive amounts of vocal fold mass on their top notes, and often employ a conspicuous [[vibrato]] in order to accentuate the emotionalism of their ardent interpretations (this kind of proper \u201cchiaroscuro\u201d technique singing, which promised a great longevity of the voice, that a lot of preceding singers used up to this point in time). \n\nSome prominent practitioners of ''verismo'' singing during the movement's Italian lifespan (circa 1890 to circa 1930) include the sopranos [[Eugenia Burzio]], [[Lina Bruna Rasa]] and Bianca Scacciati, the tenors [[Aureliano Pertile]], [[Cesar Vezzani]] and Amadeo Bassi, and the baritones [[Mario Sammarco]] and [[Eugenio Giraldoni]]. Their method of singing can be sampled on numerous 78-rpm [[Gramophone record|gramophone]] recordings.\n\nSuch great early-20th century international operatic stars as [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Rosa Ponselle]] and [[Titta Ruffo]] developed vocal techniques which harmoniously managed to combine fundamental bel canto precepts with a more 'modern', straightforward mode of ripe-toned singing when delivering ''verismo'' music, and their example has influenced operatic performers down to this day (see Scott).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|opera}}\n*[[Verismo (literature)]]\n*[[Verismo (painting)]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Opera genres}}\n\n[[Category:Opera genres]]\n[[Category:Italian opera terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verismo"}

Various scenes were also filmed inside the school's old boarding house.\n*In 2003, the school was thrown back into history when it served as the location for two seasons of the television series ''[[That'll Teach 'em]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. The school was re-branded as \"King's Grammar School\" and took thirty sixteen-year-olds for a summer of '50s style [[boarding school]] education. This first series was nominated for a [[BAFTA]]. The second series saw thirty sixteen-year-olds of lesser academic achievement experience '60s style [[Secondary Modern|Secondary Modern School]] education; in this case the school was re-branded \"Hope Green Secondary Modern\". However, different parts of the school were used in each series, giving the impression that the school used in the second series was not that used in the first.\n*On 1 May 2009 BBC TV show [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] recorded at the school.
