Under the $15 scenario, in 2025 up to 27 million workers could see increases to their average weekly earnings while 3.7 million workers could lose employment.  The latter statistic, in CBO's estimation would rise over time in any wage increase scenario as capital allocation replaces some workers.  Wage increases would be heavily skewed (40%) towards those already earning above the minimum wage with more than 80% of benefits accruing to more educated workers living above the poverty line (Table 5).  The number of persons in poverty would be reduced by 1.3 million (assuming no tax implications from increased income).  The CBO notes that it does not consider the inflationary effects of these policies when estimating the change in poverty level as these estimates, while increasing inflation, are uncertain.  Additionally, the CBO assumed that the weight of benefits would accrue to those below the poverty level based on historical wage increase levels. They noted that data on the minimum wage tends to assume the opposite (that benefits accrue to those above the poverty level), but that that data was not definitive enough to allow for estimation in their work.

Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, [[Substitute good|substitute other products]], or switch to imported products, due to the effects of [[price elasticity of demand]]. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_21.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Minimum Wage, Restaurant Prices, and Labor Market Structure'', August 2007]</ref> However, there are studies that show that higher prices for products due to increased labor cost are usually only by about 0.4% of the original price.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Effect on suicides===\nResearchers found in 2019 that, \"Between 1990 and 2015, raising the minimum wage by $1 in each state might have saved more than 27,000 lives, according to a report published this week in the ''Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.''

The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the [[marginal propensity to consume]] or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.<ref name=\"CBOMinWage1\"/> Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/higher-wages-low-income-workers-lead-higher-productivity|title=Higher Wages for Low-Income Workers Lead to Higher Productivity|date=13 January 2015|website=Piie.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.<ref name=\"CBOMinWage1\"/>\n\nAdditionally, a study by Overstreet in 2019 examined increases to the minimum wage in Arizona. Utilizing data spanning from 1976 to 2017, Overstreet found that a 1% increase in the minimum wage was significantly correlated with a 1.13% increase in per capita income in Arizona. This study could show that smaller increases in minimum wage may not distort labor market as significantly as larger increases experienced in other cities and states. Thus, the small increases experienced in Arizona may have actually led to a slight increase in economic growth.<ref>Overstreet, Dallin. \"The Effect of Minimum Wage on Per Capita Income in Arizona: Empirical Analysis.\" Poverty & Public Policy 11.1-2 (2019): 156-168.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pop4.249</ref>\n\n===Income inequality===\n{{Further|Income inequality in the United States}}\n[[File:Minimum to Median Wage OECD 2016.png|upright=1.0|thumb|Minimum wage levels in developed economies as a share of median full-time wage.

The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.<ref name=\"CBOMinWage1\"/> Writing in ''The Atlantic'', journalist Derek Thompson summarized several studies which indicate that both state-level minimum wage increases and tighter labor markets caused wages to grow faster for lower income workers than higher income workers during the 2018-2019 time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/labor-departments-new-report-isnt-so-gloomy/599491/?|title=The Best Economic News No One Wants to Talk About|publisher=The Atlantic|date=2019-10-04| quote=What\u2019s happening here? ...

The consumer group sought to improve working conditions by boycotting products which were made under sweated conditions and did not conform to a code of \"fair house\" standards drawn up by them.

Under the $15 scenario, in 2025 up to 27 million workers could see increases to their average weekly earnings while 3.7 million workers could lose employment.  The latter statistic, in CBO's estimation would rise over time in any wage increase scenario as capital allocation replaces some workers.  Wage increases would be heavily skewed (40%) towards those already earning above the minimum wage with more than 80% of benefits accruing to more educated workers living above the poverty line (Table 5).  The number of persons in poverty would be reduced by 1.3 million (assuming no tax implications from increased income).  The CBO notes that it does not consider the inflationary effects of these policies when estimating the change in poverty level as these estimates, while increasing inflation, are uncertain.  Additionally, the CBO assumed that the weight of benefits would accrue to those below the poverty level based on historical wage increase levels. They noted that data on the minimum wage tends to assume the opposite (that benefits accrue to those above the poverty level), but that that data was not definitive enough to allow for estimation in their work.

Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, [[Substitute good|substitute other products]], or switch to imported products, due to the effects of [[price elasticity of demand]]. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor.

The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the [[marginal propensity to consume]] or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.<ref name=\"CBOMinWage1\"/> Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/higher-wages-low-income-workers-lead-higher-productivity|title=Higher Wages for Low-Income Workers Lead to Higher Productivity|date=13 January 2015|website=Piie.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth.

Utilizing data spanning from 1976 to 2017, Overstreet found that a 1% increase in the minimum wage was significantly correlated with a 1.13% increase in per capita income in Arizona. This study could show that smaller increases in minimum wage may not distort labor market as significantly as larger increases experienced in other cities and states. Thus, the small increases experienced in Arizona may have actually led to a slight increase in economic growth.<ref>Overstreet, Dallin. \"The Effect of Minimum Wage on Per Capita Income in Arizona: Empirical Analysis.\" Poverty & Public Policy 11.1-2 (2019): 156-168.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pop4.249</ref>\n\n===Income inequality===\n{{Further|Income inequality in the United States}}\n[[File:Minimum to Median Wage OECD 2016.png|upright=1.0|thumb|Minimum wage levels in developed economies as a share of median full-time wage.

Its members introduce and vote on bills and resolutions, provide legislative oversight for state agencies, and help to craft the state's budget. The [[upper house]] of the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] is the [[Oklahoma Senate]].\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Constitution]] established the powers of the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1907. Voters further amended those powers through constitutional referenda. One referendum required legislators to balance the annual state budget. Others specified the length and dates of the legislative session. Today, there are 101 House members, each representing a legislative district. District boundaries are redrawn every decade to ensure districts of equal population.\n\nOne must be 21 years of age at the time of election and a qualified elector and resident of the legislative district to serve in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The state holds district elections every two years coincident with federal elections and special elections to fill vacant seats. The House meets from early February until the last Friday in May. Members elect a [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]] as the presiding officer and a Speaker Pro Tempore, who serves as the presiding officer in his or her absence. Members organize in [[political party]]-based caucuses to develop partisan policy agendas.\n\nAfter the 2018 election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] hold a [[supermajority]] of the House seats.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe [[Oklahoma Constitution]] established both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and [[Oklahoma Senate]] in 1907.

Bill sponsors submit requests for bill drafting to the professional staff of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The staff ensure bills have proper legal language and meet constitutional requirements. The bills are filed electronically with the Clerk of the House's office by a designated filing deadline.

(Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1978). ''The Legislative Process in Oklahoma'', p. 109-111. {{ISBN|0-8061-1421-5}}</ref> Legislators use joint resolutions to propose a constitutional amendment. Concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of [[law]]. Instead, they serve to express the opinion of approving house of houses, or to regulate [[Procedural law|procedure]]. Article 5 Section 33 of the [[Oklahoma Constitution]] requires bills for raising revenue to originate in the Oklahoma House.\n\n[[File:Central view of Oklahoma Capitol building.JPG|thumb|250px|Oklahoma State Capitol]]\n[[File:Oklahoma House of Representatives chamber.png|thumb|right|250px|House of Representative's Chamber]]\nThe Oklahoma House meets in regular session in the west wing of the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]] in [[Oklahoma City]], from the first Monday in February to the last Friday in May. Special sessions may be called by the governor, or by a written call signed by two-thirds of the members of each chamber of the Legislature.\n\nBills receive a First Reading when they are published in the House Journal. They then undergo a Second Reading upon assignment to committee. The committee system is designed to screen out legislation that is, in the committee's judgment, unnecessary or not ready for passage.<ref name=\"process\"/>\n\nCommittees either stop the progress of a bill or approve it for consideration on the floor of the House. When a bill is called up on the floor, either the principal author or a member of his or her choice will be recognized for the explanation of the bill. Typically, after questions from other members, the bill is advanced to Third Reading and a vote is taken on final passage.<ref name=\"process\"/>\n\nFifty-one votes are required for bill passage on the floor of the Oklahoma House. Lawmakers also vote on whether or not to make the bill effective upon signature of the governor, which requires a two-thirds majority. Action on the floor is recorded in the House Journal.<ref name=\"process\"/>\n \nOnce approved on Third Reading, which is the name for this stage of the floor process, approved bills are sent to the [[Oklahoma Senate]]. If amended, bills will return to the Oklahoma House of Representatives for an acceptance of the Senate amendment(s) or to work out the differences in a conference committee, but can go directly to the governor after Senate passage.<ref name=\"process\"/>\n\nThe Oklahoma House is not subject to the state's open meeting and open records laws due to provisions to exempt the state legislature in the 1977-enacted laws.<ref name=\"newsok1\"/>\n\n==Party composition==\n\n{| style=\"width:50%\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center\" | {{Down-arrow|alt=Midpoint}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#F33; width:76.2%; text-align:center; color:white\" | '''77'''\n| style=\"background:#33F; width:23.8%; text-align:center; color:white\" | '''24'''\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; color:#F33\" | '''Republican'''\n| style=\"text-align:center; color:#33F\" | '''Democratic'''\n|}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!rowspan=3|Affiliation\n!colspan=2|Party <div style=\"font-size:80%\">(Shading indicates majority caucus)</div>\n!rowspan=3|Total\n!\n|- style=\"height:5px\"\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}\" |\n|style=\"background: black\"|\n|-\n![[Oklahoma Republican Party|Republican]]\n![[Oklahoma Democratic Party|Democratic]]\n!Vacant\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|54th Legislature\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 72\n| 29\n! 101\n| 0\n|-\n|colspan=5|\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|55th legislature\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 71\n| 30\n! 101\n| 0\n|-\n|colspan=5|\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|Begin 56th Legislature\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 75\n| 26\n! 101\n| 0\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|End 56th Legislature\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 72\n| 27\n! 99\n| 2\n|-\n|colspan=5|\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|Begin 57th Legislature\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 76\n| 25\n! 101\n! 0\n|-\n!nowrap style=\"font-size:80%\"|December 6, 2018<ref>[https://kfor.com/2018/12/06/oklahoma-state-representative-changes-party-affiliation/ Johnny Tadlock (D-01) switches affiliation from Democrat to Republican]</ref>\n|{{party shading/Republican}}| 77\n| 24\n!101\n!0\n|-\n!Latest voting share\n! {{party shading/Republican}} |{{percentage|77|101|2}}\n!{{percentage|24|101|2}}\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n|}\n\n==Current members==\n[[File:Oklahoma House of Representatives map November 2018.png|thumb|right|750px|Oklahoma House of Representatives districts after the November 6, 2018 elections.\n{{legend|#263d7e|Democratic Party}}\n{{legend|#b42d2d|Republican Party}}]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Representation was determined by taking the total population of the state, according to the most recent federal census, and that number was divided by one hundred, with the quotient equaling one ratio. Counties having a population less than one full ratio received one Representative; every county containing an entire ratio but less than two ratios was to be assigned two Representatives; every county containing a population of two entire ratios but less than three ratios was to be assigned three Representatives; and every county containing a population of three entire ratios but less than four ratios was to be assigned four Representatives. After the first four Representatives, a county was to qualify for additional representation on the basis of two whole ratios of population for each additional Representative.\n\nIn 1964, the United States Supreme Court ruled that this method violated the federal constitution, as it resulted in districts having wildly different populations. State lawmakers implemented a new method that continues to be used today. The Oklahoma House of Representatives must draw new district boundaries within 90 days of the latest Federal Decennial Census. Under the holding of ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533 (1964) districts must be apportioned within a five percent margin of the average target size district as determined by the U.S. Census population figures divided by the one hundred and one districts. This allows for certain districts to be slightly smaller or larger than others. The Oklahoma House of Representatives draws its own maps of its district lines, which are subject to the approval of both the state senate and the governor. Should the redistricting not occur in the time limits prescribed by law, the lines are determined by a panel of five statewide elected officials.\n\n===Leadership===\nAs of January 3, 2017, [[Charles A. McCall]] is serving his first term as [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]].

Its members introduce and vote on bills and resolutions, provide legislative oversight for state agencies, and help to craft the state's budget. The [[upper house]] of the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] is the [[Oklahoma Senate]].\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Constitution]] established the powers of the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1907. Voters further amended those powers through constitutional referenda. One referendum required legislators to balance the annual state budget. Others specified the length and dates of the legislative session. Today, there are 101 House members, each representing a legislative district. District boundaries are redrawn every decade to ensure districts of equal population.\n\nOne must be 21 years of age at the time of election and a qualified elector and resident of the legislative district to serve in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The state holds district elections every two years coincident with federal elections and special elections to fill vacant seats. The House meets from early February until the last Friday in May. Members elect a [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]] as the presiding officer and a Speaker Pro Tempore, who serves as the presiding officer in his or her absence. Members organize in [[political party]]-based caucuses to develop partisan policy agendas.\n\nAfter the 2018 election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] hold a [[supermajority]] of the House seats.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe [[Oklahoma Constitution]] established both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and [[Oklahoma Senate]] in 1907.

Representation was determined by taking the total population of the state, according to the most recent federal census, and that number was divided by one hundred, with the quotient equaling one ratio. Counties having a population less than one full ratio received one Representative; every county containing an entire ratio but less than two ratios was to be assigned two Representatives; every county containing a population of two entire ratios but less than three ratios was to be assigned three Representatives; and every county containing a population of three entire ratios but less than four ratios was to be assigned four Representatives. After the first four Representatives, a county was to qualify for additional representation on the basis of two whole ratios of population for each additional Representative.\n\nIn 1964, the United States Supreme Court ruled that this method violated the federal constitution, as it resulted in districts having wildly different populations. State lawmakers implemented a new method that continues to be used today. The Oklahoma House of Representatives must draw new district boundaries within 90 days of the latest Federal Decennial Census. Under the holding of ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533 (1964) districts must be apportioned within a five percent margin of the average target size district as determined by the U.S. Census population figures divided by the one hundred and one districts. This allows for certain districts to be slightly smaller or larger than others. The Oklahoma House of Representatives draws its own maps of its district lines, which are subject to the approval of both the state senate and the governor. Should the redistricting not occur in the time limits prescribed by law, the lines are determined by a panel of five statewide elected officials.\n\n===Leadership===\nAs of January 3, 2017, [[Charles A. McCall]] is serving his first term as [[Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives]]. He was first chosen May 2, 2016, by the House Republican Caucus as Speaker-designate for the 2017-2018 term.<ref name=\"speaker\">Oklahoma House of Representatives.</ref> Harold Wright, of [[Weatherford, Oklahoma]], was chosen as Speaker Pro Tempore elect on January 3, 2017.

In 2005 the band recorded the next album ''3rd Draft'', however the album's release was denied by the label after [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] bought out DreamWorks. It was eventually released in 2006 as ''[[Up in the Attic]]'', charting at number 114 on the ''Billboard'' 200.

United States, in 1996. They have released five studio albums, and have sold over 5 million units worldwide. The band's cover of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Smooth_Criminal#Alien Ant Farm cover|Smooth Criminal]]\" topped the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Alternative songs]] charts in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-10-best-covers-of-michael-jacksons-songs-20140627|title=The 10 Best Covers of Michael Jackson|work=Rolling Stone|author=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630041131/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-10-best-covers-of-michael-jacksons-songs-20140627|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}</ref>\n\nThey released their debut album ''Greatest Hits'' independently in 1999, then signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] in 2000. Their second album ''[[Anthology (Alien Ant Farm album)|ANThology]]'' was released in 2001 and has been [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|certified platinum by the RIAA]], selling over one million copies and reaching number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Following up that was their third album, ''[[Truant (album)|TruANT]]'', released in 2003. The album was produced by brothers [[Robert DeLeo|Robert]] and [[Dean DeLeo]] of [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and made it to 42 on the ''Billboard'' 200. In 2005 the band recorded the next album ''3rd Draft'', however the album's release was denied by the label after [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] bought out DreamWorks. It was eventually released in 2006 as ''[[Up in the Attic]]'', charting at number 114 on the ''Billboard'' 200.

The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King [[B\u00e9la III]].\n\nIn the second century AD there was a Roman trading post established on an island in the Tisza, and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.<ref>Szeged by Dr. Trogmayer Ott\u00f3</ref>\n\nDuring [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the Mongol invasion]] the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and \u2013 as the Turkish armies got closer to Hungary \u2013 the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] had a [[city wall|wall]] built around the town. Szeged was raised to [[free royal town]] status in 1498.\n\nSzeged was first pillaged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] army on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]). The town was a sanjak centre first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] (1543\u20131596), after in [[E\u011fri Eyalet]]i. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its [[coat of arms]] (still used today) from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]]. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. [[Piarists|Piarist]] monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 [[witch trial]]s were frequent in the town, with the [[Szeged witch trials]] of 1728-29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil.  In 1720, the ethnic Hungarian population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the Serb inhabitants was 1300.<ref>\u00c1d\u00e1m Fej\u00e9r, Magyarok \u00e9s szl\u00e1vok.

[[Lajos Kossuth]] delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The [[Habsburg]] rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again, the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick's shop \u2013 the predecessor of today's world-famous Pick [[Salami]] Factory \u2013 was opened in 1869.\n[[File:Szeged, Dugonics t\u00e9r a nagy\u00e1rv\u00edzkor, szemben a K\u00e1lv\u00e1ria-sug\u00e1r\u00fat. Fortepan 15599.jpg|thumb|Szeged during the flood of 1879]]\nToday the inner city of Szeged has beautiful buildings and wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great [[flood]] of 1879, which literally wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] visited the town and promised that \"Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be\". He kept his promise. During the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.\n\n===During the 20th century===\n[[File:Sz\u00e9chenyi t\u00e9r, a Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r-h\u00e1z el\u0151tti sz\u00e9lesebb j\u00e1rda.

Fortepan 8569.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Szeged, 1939]]\nAfter the [[Hungary in World War I|First World War]] Hungary lost its southern territories to [[Serbia]], as a result Szeged became a city close to the [[border]], and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of [[Transylvania]] to Romania, University of Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], moved to Szeged in 1921 (see [[University of Szeged]]). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of [[Bishop|episcopal]] seat from Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania). It was briefly occupied by [[Romanian army]] during [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|Hungarian-Romanian War]] in 1919. During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.\n\nSzeged suffered heavily during [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]]. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, the Jewish citizens were confined to [[ghetto]]s and then taken to [[death camp]]s. Szeged was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 11 October 1944 in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. During the Communist-era, Szeged became a centre of [[light industry]] and [[food industry]]. In 1965 [[Petroleum|oil]] was found near the city.\n\nIn 1962, Szeged became the county seat of Csongr\u00e1d. Whole new districts were built, and lots of nearby villages (e.g. [[T\u00e1p\u00e9]], [[Sz\u0151reg]], [[Kiskundorozsma]], [[Szentmih\u00e1lytelek]], [[Gy\u00e1lar\u00e9t]]) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the Communist era).\n\nToday's Szeged is an important university town and a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]] (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z.<ref>[http://www.symph-szeged.hu/ Szeged Symphony Orchestra website], accessed 6 August 2012.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSzeged is situated near the southern border of [[Hungary]], just to the south of the mouth of the [[Maros River]], on both banks of the [[Tisza River]], nearly in the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]].

[[Ptolemy]] mentions the oldest known name of the city: ''Partiscum.'' It is possible that [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], king of the [[Huns]] had his seat somewhere in this area. The name Szeged was first mentioned in 1183, in a document of King [[B\u00e9la III]].\n\nIn the second century AD there was a Roman trading post established on an island in the Tisza, and the foundations of the Szeged castle suggest that the structure may have been built over an even earlier fort. Today only one corner of the castle still remains standing.<ref>Szeged by Dr. Trogmayer Ott\u00f3</ref>\n\nDuring [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the Mongol invasion]] the town was destroyed and its inhabitants fled to the nearby swamps, but they soon returned and rebuilt their town. In the 14th century, during the reign of [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], Szeged became the most important town of Southern Hungary, and \u2013 as the Turkish armies got closer to Hungary \u2013 the strategic importance of Szeged grew. King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] had a [[city wall|wall]] built around the town. Szeged was raised to [[free royal town]] status in 1498.\n\nSzeged was first pillaged by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] army on 28 September 1526, but was occupied only in 1543, and became an administrative centre of the Ottomans (see [[Ottoman Hungary]]). The town was a sanjak centre first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] (1543\u20131596), after in [[E\u011fri Eyalet]]i. The town was freed from Turkish rule on 23 October 1686, and regained the free royal town status in 1715. In 1719, Szeged received its [[coat of arms]] (still used today) from [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]]. During the next several years, Szeged grew and prospered. [[Piarists|Piarist]] monks arrived in Szeged in 1719 and opened a new grammar school in 1721. Szeged also held scientific lectures and theatrical plays. These years brought not only prosperity but also enlightenment. Between 1728 and 1744 [[witch trial]]s were frequent in the town, with the [[Szeged witch trials]] of 1728-29 perhaps being the largest. The witch trials were instigated by the authorities, who decided on this measure to remove the problem of the public complaints about the drought and its consequences of famine and epidemics by laying the responsibility on people among them, which had fraternized with the Devil.  In 1720, the ethnic Hungarian population of the town numbered about 13000 to 16000, while the number of the Serb inhabitants was 1300.<ref>\u00c1d\u00e1m Fej\u00e9r, Magyarok \u00e9s szl\u00e1vok.

[[Lajos Kossuth]] delivered his famous speech here. Szeged was the last seat of the revolutionary government in July 1849. The [[Habsburg]] rulers punished the leaders of the town, but later Szeged began to prosper again, the railway reached it in 1854, and the town got its free royal town status back in 1860. Mark Pick's shop \u2013 the predecessor of today's world-famous Pick [[Salami]] Factory \u2013 was opened in 1869.\n[[File:Szeged, Dugonics t\u00e9r a nagy\u00e1rv\u00edzkor, szemben a K\u00e1lv\u00e1ria-sug\u00e1r\u00fat. Fortepan 15599.jpg|thumb|Szeged during the flood of 1879]]\nToday the inner city of Szeged has beautiful buildings and wide avenues. This is mainly due to the great [[flood]] of 1879, which literally wiped away the whole town (only 265 of the 5723 houses remained and 165 people died). Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] visited the town and promised that \"Szeged will be more beautiful than it used to be\". He kept his promise. During the next years a new, modern city emerged from the ruins, with palaces and wide streets.\n\n===During the 20th century===\n[[File:Sz\u00e9chenyi t\u00e9r, a Zs\u00f3t\u00e9r-h\u00e1z el\u0151tti sz\u00e9lesebb j\u00e1rda.

Fortepan 8569.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Szeged, 1939]]\nAfter the [[Hungary in World War I|First World War]] Hungary lost its southern territories to [[Serbia]], as a result Szeged became a city close to the [[border]], and its importance lessened, but as it took over roles that formerly belonged to the now lost cities, it slowly recovered. Following the Loss of [[Transylvania]] to Romania, University of Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], moved to Szeged in 1921 (see [[University of Szeged]]). In 1923 Szeged took over the role of [[Bishop|episcopal]] seat from Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania). It was briefly occupied by [[Romanian army]] during [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919|Hungarian-Romanian War]] in 1919. During the 1920s the Jewish population of Szeged grew and reached its zenith.\n\nSzeged suffered heavily during [[Hungary in World War II|World War II]]. 6,000 inhabitants of the city were killed, the Jewish citizens were confined to [[ghetto]]s and then taken to [[death camp]]s. Szeged was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] on 11 October 1944 in the course of the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. During the Communist-era, Szeged became a centre of [[light industry]] and [[food industry]]. In 1965 [[Petroleum|oil]] was found near the city.\n\nIn 1962, Szeged became the county seat of Csongr\u00e1d. Whole new districts were built, and lots of nearby villages (e.g. [[T\u00e1p\u00e9]], [[Sz\u0151reg]], [[Kiskundorozsma]], [[Szentmih\u00e1lytelek]], [[Gy\u00e1lar\u00e9t]]) were annexed to the city in 1973 (as was a tendency during the Communist era).\n\nToday's Szeged is an important university town and a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe [[Szeged Symphony Orchestra]] (Szegedi Szimfonikus Zenekar) gives regular concerts at the Szegedi Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z.<ref>[http://www.symph-szeged.hu/ Szeged Symphony Orchestra website], accessed 6 August 2012.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSzeged is situated near the southern border of [[Hungary]], just to the south of the mouth of the [[Maros River]], on both banks of the [[Tisza River]], nearly in the centre of the [[Carpathian Basin]].

Two motorways, [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5]] and [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43]], lie along the city border. Through the [[M5 motorway (Hungary)|M5 Motorway]] Szeged is connected to [[Kecskem\u00e9t]], [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] and [[Budapest]] in the north direction and to [[Subotica]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Beograd]] in [[Serbia]] in the south direction. Thanks to the [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|M43 Motorway]] - which splits from the M5 Motorway near Szeged - goes near [[Mak\u00f3]] to [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Timisoara]] in [[Romania]].  In addition, there are other roads running from the city to Mak\u00f3 and [[Nagylak]] (Mainroad 43), to [[R\u00f6szke]] (Mainroad 5), to [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]] (Mainroad 5), to [[\u00c1sotthalom]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] (Mainroad 55) and to [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]], [[Orosh\u00e1za]] and [[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] (Mainroad 47).\n\nThe Budapest-Szeged-rail line is an important rail connection, as well as the Railwaylines 121 (to Mak\u00f3), 135 (to H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely), 136 (to R\u00f6szke) and 140 (to Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za).<ref>[Rail transport map of Hungary by the Hungarian Rail Capacity Allocation Office (VPE)]</ref>\n\nA [[tram-train]] system is under construction to connect Szeged with the neighbouring [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] and possibly [[Mak\u00f3]], thus creating the second most populous [[urban agglomeration]] in the country, after the capital.

In 1908, the U.S Congress passed a bill{{citation_needed|date=April 2020}} to return to China the excess of Boxer Indemnity, amounting to over 17 million dollars. Despite the fierce controversies over returning the excess payment, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s administration decided to establish the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program to educate young Chinese generation. President Roosevelt recognized this program as a chance for \u201cAmerican-directed reform in China\u201d <ref name=Ye/> that could maximize U.S's profit by improving the U.S- China relations, bridging China with American culture, and promoting U.S's international image. Instead of mimicking the European Imperialism and use military means to reap short-term financial gain, Roosevelt established the program to insure peace and trade in China in the \"most satisfactory and subtle of all ways\",<ref name=Smith /> while helping United States gain respect and take its leadership position in the world.\n\nSince its inception, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program has been called \"the most important scheme for educating Chinese students in America and arguably the most consequential and successful in the entire foreign-study movement of twentieth century China.\"<ref name=Ye/>\n[[File:Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship recipients 1909 2.jpg|thumb|The first group of Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program students in 1909.  Future president of the Republic of China [[Zhou Ziqi]] is seated in the front center.]]\n\n==Background==\n===Chinese Educational Mission===\n{{Main|Chinese Educational Mission}}\nPrior to the establishment of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program, [[Yung Wing]]'s [[Chinese Educational Mission]] also provided some higher education opportunities in the U.S. for Chinese students. As the first Chinese graduate of Yale University, Yung Wing persuaded the Qing government to send groups of young Chinese students to the United States to study Western science and technology in 1871. Beginning in 1872, with the support of some reform-minded officials of the [[Qing dynasty]], Yung established the Chinese Educational Mission to send 120 Chinese students to study in the New England region of the United States. However, this short-lived effort was disbanded in 1881, a year prior to the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], and there was little subsequent activity.\n\n[[File:BoxerAmericanTroops.jpg|thumb|left|US troops in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.]]\n\n===Boxer Protocol===\n{{Main|Boxer Protocol}}\nIn 1899, a group of Chinese nationals known as Boxers, rebelled against the [[Qing Empire]] in an attempt to expel all foreign influences in China. The uprising, later came to known as the [[Boxer Rebellion]], began as an [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]], peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism.

The nation which succeeds in educating the young Chinese of the present generation will be the nation which for a given expenditure of effort will reap the largest possible returns in moral, intellectual and commercial influence.<ref name=\"timmins1\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the tendency in China at that time was to \u201cadopt the policy of Japan, and so engage Japan as her instructor\u201d.<ref name=fear /> As Japan's military and political influence developed rapidly, Roosevelt's administration could not allow the large influx of Chinese students to Japan continue rising and watch their Pacific rival take over China through intellectual domination. Therefore, he quickly \u201cassented in April 1906 to the wisdom of Smith\u2019s proposal\u201d <ref name=Hunt/> and decided to establish the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program to \u201cturn the current of Chinese students\u201d<ref name=Smith/> to America. The following year Roosevelt expressed this message to the Senate and House of Representatives in his annual address:\n<blockquote>Mr. Roosevelt announces the intention of the United States Government to release China from all payments in connection with the Boxer war indemnity in excess of the sum necessary for the actual indemnity to the United States\u2026 The United States, he adds, \u2018should help in every practicable way in the education of the Chinese people, so that the vast and populous Empire of China may gradually adapt itself to modern conditions.

With China's reform-friendly environment, the American-returned students would occupy important positions in politics due to their knowledge of American bureaucracy.

It was, as Smith envisioned, the most \u201csatisfactory and subtle\u201d way to \u201creap the largest possible returns in moral, intellectual, and commercial influence\u201d, because \u201ctrade follows moral and spiritual domination far more inevitably than it follows the flag\u201d.<ref name=Smith/> The establishment of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program was not only \u201can act of friendship\u201d <ref name=nyt /> as Roosevelt claimed, it was also a cultural investment for bridging China with the U.S and a farsighted scheme for peacefully controlling China's reform and development.\n\nDespite further proposals by the Chinese to use the funds within China, the settlement was made on American terms.<ref name=Hunt />\n\n==Development==\nThe program, set up in 1909, funded the selection, preparatory training, transportation to the U.S., and study for the scholarship beneficiaries. Part of the first remission of money included the establishment of a preparatory school (\u8084\u4e1a\u9986 ''Y\u00ecy\u00e8gu\u01cen'') in [[Peking]] (Beijing) for Chinese graduates pursuing further studies at American universities. The preparatory school, established on 29 April 1911 on the site of a [[Tsinghua Park|former royal garden]], was named Tsinghua College ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6e05\u534e\u5b66\u5802\\}}; ''Q\u012bnghu\u00e1 Xu\u00e9t\u00e1ng'').<ref name=\"Su-Yan Pan 2009 68\">{{cite book|title=University autonomy, the state, and social change in China|author=Su-Yan Pan|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2009|page=68|isbn=978-962-209-936-4}}</ref> The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the [[YMCA]] from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.<ref name=\"Su-Yan Pan 2009 68\"/> The school was later expanded to offer four-year undergraduate and post-graduate programs and became the renowned [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA second remission in 1924 provided for the establishment of the China Foundation (\u4e2d\u534e\u6587\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 W\u00e9nhu\u00e0 Ji\u00e0oy\u00f9 J\u012bj\u012bnhu\u00ec''), which would in turn fund the [[China Institute]] in [[New York City]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chineselectures.org/cicu.htm |title=Founded in 1926 in New York City, China Institute is one of the oldest cultural and educational organizations in the United St |publisher=Chineselectures.org |date=1926-05-25 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1909 to 1929, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program sent around 1,300 Chinese students to study in the U.S. Drawing candidates from across China, the examination process for this prestigious scholarship was highly competitive: among 630 candidates in 1937, only 47 were selected.<ref>https://earlychinesemit.mit.edu/three-waves/boxer-indemnity-scholarship-program#_ftn2</ref> In light of China's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] during that time, the Qing government urged students to focus their studies on the fields on Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine and Commerce.

''A History of Cornell''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1962. p.403</ref>\n\nThe remittance of excess payment and the establishment of the scholarship program also helped raise the international standing of the United States. In a letter to the Secretary of State John Hay, Liang Cheng, the Chinese minister to the United States wrote, \u201cIf your honorable country would take the lead [in returning excess indemnity payments], wherever the voice of righteousness spread, those countries would rise and follow it\u201d.<ref name=Litten/> As the leader of an emerging super power, Roosevelt recognized the remission of Boxer Indemnity as an chance for the U.S. to assume leadership position in the world. Roosevelt later claimed after the remission: \u201cwe have the right to hope that the return of these funds to China will stimulate European Powers to take action similar to that just suggested, and that generosity on our part will be met by similar unconditional remission by them\u201d.<ref name=nyt /> Roosevelt's act later yielded significant results. U.S's act of justice, friendship, and allowance greatly influenced other Powers:\n<blockquote>\nOther governments, recognizing the beneficial effects of America\u2019s earlier action in this matter, are proposing to take a similar step. The Japanese Government has announced its decision to remit Japan\u2019s share of the indemnity. The French Government purposes to use its indemnity funds in the rehabilitation of a French bank in China. The British Government announced in December, 1922, that it would release its funds for purposes \u201cmutually beneficial to Great Britain and to China\u2026\u201d <ref name=nyt /></blockquote>\nThe remission of the Boxer Indemnity, as Roosevelt planned, helped the U.S to not only dispel the embarrassment caused by the boycott, but also build its international image.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Boxer Indemnity Scholarship recipients|Boxer Indemnity Scholarship recipients]]\n*[[Fulbright Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Ye>Weili Ye.

In 1908, the U.S Congress passed a bill{{citation_needed|date=April 2020}} to return to China the excess of Boxer Indemnity, amounting to over 17 million dollars. Despite the fierce controversies over returning the excess payment, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s administration decided to establish the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program to educate young Chinese generation.

Instead of mimicking the European Imperialism and use military means to reap short-term financial gain, Roosevelt established the program to insure peace and trade in China in the \"most satisfactory and subtle of all ways\",<ref name=Smith /> while helping United States gain respect and take its leadership position in the world.\n\nSince its inception, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program has been called \"the most important scheme for educating Chinese students in America and arguably the most consequential and successful in the entire foreign-study movement of twentieth century China.\"<ref name=Ye/>\n[[File:Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship recipients 1909 2.jpg|thumb|The first group of Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program students in 1909.

As the first Chinese graduate of Yale University, Yung Wing persuaded the Qing government to send groups of young Chinese students to the United States to study Western science and technology in 1871. Beginning in 1872, with the support of some reform-minded officials of the [[Qing dynasty]], Yung established the Chinese Educational Mission to send 120 Chinese students to study in the New England region of the United States. However, this short-lived effort was disbanded in 1881, a year prior to the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], and there was little subsequent activity.\n\n[[File:BoxerAmericanTroops.jpg|thumb|left|US troops in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.]]\n\n===Boxer Protocol===\n{{Main|Boxer Protocol}}\nIn 1899, a group of Chinese nationals known as Boxers, rebelled against the [[Qing Empire]] in an attempt to expel all foreign influences in China. The uprising, later came to known as the [[Boxer Rebellion]], began as an [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]], peasant-based movement in northern China, in response to foreign westerners seizing land from locals, concession grabbing, and granting immunity to criminals who converted to Catholicism. The insurgents attacked foreigners, who were building railroads and violating [[Feng shui]], and [[Christians]], who were held responsible for the foreign domination of China. In the summer of 1900, a coalition called the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] comprising [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[United States]] sent troops to quell the rebellion and forced the Qing government to sign the [[Boxer Protocol]], which required the Qing government to pay 450&nbsp;million [[tael]]s of fine silver as [[indemnity]] over a course of 39 years to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance|eight nations]] involved.<ref name=\"spence\">Spence, Jonathan D.

The preparatory school, established on 29 April 1911 on the site of a [[Tsinghua Park|former royal garden]], was named Tsinghua College ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6e05\u534e\u5b66\u5802\\}}; ''Q\u012bnghu\u00e1 Xu\u00e9t\u00e1ng'').<ref name=\"Su-Yan Pan 2009 68\">{{cite book|title=University autonomy, the state, and social change in China|author=Su-Yan Pan|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2009|page=68|isbn=978-962-209-936-4}}</ref> The faculty members for sciences were recruited by the [[YMCA]] from the United States and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.<ref name=\"Su-Yan Pan 2009 68\"/> The school was later expanded to offer four-year undergraduate and post-graduate programs and became the renowned [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA second remission in 1924 provided for the establishment of the China Foundation (\u4e2d\u534e\u6587\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 W\u00e9nhu\u00e0 Ji\u00e0oy\u00f9 J\u012bj\u012bnhu\u00ec''), which would in turn fund the [[China Institute]] in [[New York City]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chineselectures.org/cicu.htm |title=Founded in 1926 in New York City, China Institute is one of the oldest cultural and educational organizations in the United St |publisher=Chineselectures.org |date=1926-05-25 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1909 to 1929, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program sent around 1,300 Chinese students to study in the U.S. Drawing candidates from across China, the examination process for this prestigious scholarship was highly competitive: among 630 candidates in 1937, only 47 were selected.<ref>https://earlychinesemit.mit.edu/three-waves/boxer-indemnity-scholarship-program#_ftn2</ref> In light of China's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] during that time, the Qing government urged students to focus their studies on the fields on Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine and Commerce. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] was thus one of the most popular destinations.<ref name=\"Ye\"/> In 1929, after Tsinghua had become a true university itself, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program was opened to all candidates.<ref name=\"Ye\"/>\n\nA total of five groups of scholars were educated in the U.S. before the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]] in 1937.\n\n==Legacy==\nA number of prominent Chinese and [[Chinese American]]s were beneficiaries of the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program, including philosopher [[Hu Shih]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Physics prize]] winner [[Yang Chen-Ning]], electrical engineer [[Lee Yuk-Wing]], mathematician [[Chung Kai-lai]], linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]], educator  [[Kuo Ping-Wen]], rocket scientist [[Tsien Hsue-shen]], meteorologist and scholar [[Chu Coching]] and architectural engineer Edward Y. Ying, who was influential in the planning of modern Shanghai.  The scholarships served as a model for the [[Fulbright Program]]'s grants for international educational exchange.<ref>Morris Bishop. ''A History of Cornell''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1962. p.403</ref>\n\nThe remittance of excess payment and the establishment of the scholarship program also helped raise the international standing of the United States. In a letter to the Secretary of State John Hay, Liang Cheng, the Chinese minister to the United States wrote, \u201cIf your honorable country would take the lead [in returning excess indemnity payments], wherever the voice of righteousness spread, those countries would rise and follow it\u201d.<ref name=Litten/> As the leader of an emerging super power, Roosevelt recognized the remission of Boxer Indemnity as an chance for the U.S. to assume leadership position in the world. Roosevelt later claimed after the remission: \u201cwe have the right to hope that the return of these funds to China will stimulate European Powers to take action similar to that just suggested, and that generosity on our part will be met by similar unconditional remission by them\u201d.<ref name=nyt /> Roosevelt's act later yielded significant results. U.S's act of justice, friendship, and allowance greatly influenced other Powers:\n<blockquote>\nOther governments, recognizing the beneficial effects of America\u2019s earlier action in this matter, are proposing to take a similar step. The Japanese Government has announced its decision to remit Japan\u2019s share of the indemnity. The French Government purposes to use its indemnity funds in the rehabilitation of a French bank in China. The British Government announced in December, 1922, that it would release its funds for purposes \u201cmutually beneficial to Great Britain and to China\u2026\u201d <ref name=nyt /></blockquote>\nThe remission of the Boxer Indemnity, as Roosevelt planned, helped the U.S to not only dispel the embarrassment caused by the boycott, but also build its international image.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Boxer Indemnity Scholarship recipients|Boxer Indemnity Scholarship recipients]]\n*[[Fulbright Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Ye>Weili Ye.

This was replaced by the U.S. ''Tank Corps'' which lasted until 1921.  No U.S. tank force existed (they were assigned to infantry/cavalry outfits) until the Armored Forces was created in 1940. This was replaced by the current armor branch of today in 1950.</ref> with [[tank]]s in 1940, but the term \"cavalry\", e.g. \"armored cavalry\", remains in use in the U.S. Army for mounted (ground and aviation) [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)|reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA) units based on their parent [[Combat Arms Regimental System]] (CARS) regiment. ''Cavalry'' is also used in the name of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] for heraldic/lineage/historical purposes. Some [[Brigade Combat Team#Armored Brigade Combat Team|combined arms battalions]] (i.e., consisting of a combination of tank and mechanized infantry companies) are designated as ''armor'' formations, while others are designated as [[Infantry Branch (United States)|''infantry'']] organizations. These [[Structure of the United States Army#Branches and Functional Areas|\"branch\"]] designations are again, heraldic/lineage/historical titles derived from the CARS regiments to which the battalions are assigned.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] (1846\u20131848) \"had resulted in adding a vast territory to our national domain, and the government was bound, in the interests of civilization, to open this immense area to settlement...the country between the Missouri River and California... was occupied by powerful and warlike tribes of Indians.\"  But the size of the army had remained fixed. In 1855, at the request of General [[Winfield Scott]] Congress added the 1st and 2nd Cavalry regiments to the U.S. Army.<ref>Price (1883) pp. 14, 21</ref>\n\nCongress originally created the 1st U.S. Dragoons in 1833. The 2nd U.S. Dragoons, and the U.S. Mounted Riflemen followed in 1836 and 1846 respectively.<ref name=\"Price 1883 p. 12\">Price (1883) p. 12</ref><ref>Grant (2009) p. 23, \"I was anxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called...\"</ref>  Prior to \"1833 mounted troops were raised (in 1808 and 1812) as emergencies presented themselves and were disbanded as soon as these had passed.\"<ref name=\"Price 1883 p. 12\"/><ref>Smith (2001) p. 1, \"...There existed among the people of the United States a strong prejudice against maintaining even a small regular army in time of peace.\"</ref>  Often the newly designated forces were influenced after cavalry units employed during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), especially by the opposing well-supplied  mounted dragoons units of the [[British Army|King's Army (British Army)]], especially used with great effectiveness in the Southern Theater of the [[Carolinas]] in the latter part of the war. The traditions of the U.S. Cavalry originated with the horse-mounted force which played an important role in extending United States governance into the [[Western United States]], especially after the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), with the need to cover vast ranges of territory between scattered isolated forts and outposts of the minimal resources given to the stretched thin U.S. Army.\n\nSignificant numbers of horse mounted units participated in later foreign conflicts in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, and in the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] battlefields of [[Europe]] in [[World War I]] (1917\u20131918), although numbers and roles declined.\n\nImmediately preceding [[World War II]] (1941\u20131945), the U.S. Cavalry began transitioning to a mechanized, mounted force. During the Second World War, the Army's cavalry units operated as horse-mounted, mechanized, or dismounted forces (infantry). The last horse-mounted cavalry charge by a U.S. Cavalry unit took place on the [[Bataan]] Peninsula, in the [[Philippines]] in early 1942. The [[26th Cavalry Regiment]] of the allied [[Philippine Scouts]] executed the charge against [[Imperial Japanese Army]] forces near the village of Morong on 16 January 1942.<ref>Afterward, the besieged, combined United States-Philippine force was forced to slaughter their horses for food, and the 26th Regiment continued to fight on foot as guerillas until their surrender.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Cavalry branch was absorbed into the Armor branch as part of the Army Reorganization Act of 1950. The [[Vietnam War]] saw the introduction of helicopters and operations as a helicopter-borne force with the designation of [[air cavalry|'''Air Cavalry''']], while mechanized cavalry received the designation of '''Armored Cavalry'''.\nToday, cavalry designations and traditions continue with regiments of both armor and aviation units that perform the cavalry mission. The [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] is the only active [[Division (military)|division]] in the United States Army with a cavalry designation. The division maintains a detachment of horse-mounted cavalry for ceremonial purposes.\n\n== History ==\n\nWashington saw the intimidating effect of the small force of [[17th Lancers|British 17th Light Dragoons]], which panicked his militia infantry at [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]]. Appreciating the ability of the 5th Regiment of Connecticut Light Horse Militia, under Major Elisha Sheldon, to gather intelligence during the subsequent retreat of Continental forces into New Jersey, he asked the Continental Congress for a light cavalry force in the Continental army. In late 1776, Congress authorized Washington to establish a mounted force of 3,000 men.\n\n=== American Revolutionary War ===\n{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}\n\nOn 12 December 1776, Congress converted Elisha Sheldon's militia regiment into the [[2nd Continental Light Dragoons|Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. In March 1777, Washington established the Corps of Continental Light Dragoons consisting of four regiments of 280 men, each organised in six troops. Many problems faced the light dragoon regiments, including the inability of recruiting to bring the units to authorized strength, shortage of suitable cavalry weapons and horses, and lack of uniformity among troopers in dress and discipline. Congress appointed the Hungarian revolutionary and professional soldier [[Michael Kovats]] and the Polish [[Kazimierz Pulaski|Casimir Pulaski]] to train them as an offensive strike force during winter quarters of 1777\u201378 at Trenton, New Jersey.\n\n[[File:Kazimierz Pulaski.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Poland|Polish]] nobleman and soldier [[Casimir Pulaski]] was one of the founders and \"fathers of American cavalry\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=24tzlsTt164C&pg=PA1&dq=pulaski+father+of+american+cavalry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIuJq_9LrhAhVHeH0KHfYwCqI4ChDoAQg2MAI#v=onepage&q=pulaski+father+of+american+cavalry&f=false|title=Casmir Pulaski|first=Carole|last=Marsh|date=30 September 2002|publisher=Gallopade International|accessdate=6 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>]]\n\nPulaski's efforts led to friction with the American officers, resulting in his resignation, but Congress authorized Pulaski to form his own independent corps in 1778. Pulaski's Legion consisted of dragoons, riflemen, grenadiers, and infantry. Another independent corps of dragoons joined Pulaski's in the Continental Line during 1778 when a former captain in Bland's Horse, [[Henry Lee III|\"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]], formed [[Lee's Legion|Lee's Corps of Partisan Light Dragoons]], which specialized in raiding British supply lines. Colonel [[Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rou\u00ebrie]] (\"Col. Armand\"), a French nobleman, raised a third corps of infantry in Boston, called the Free and Independent Chasseurs, which later added a troop of dragoons, becoming [[Armand's Legion]]. Although a reorganization in 1778 authorized expansion of the four regiments to 415 men each, forage difficulties, expiration of enlistments, desertions, and other problems made this impossible, and no regiment ever carried more than 200 men on its rolls, and they averaged 120 to 180 men between 1778 and 1780.\n\nIn 1779, Washington ordered the 2nd and [[4th Continental Light Dragoons]] equipped temporarily as infantry, and deployed the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons|1st]] and [[3rd Continental Light Dragoons]] and [[Pulaski's Legion]] to the South to join local militia cavalry and to oppose the new British strategy for controlling that area. Battle engagements in South Carolina largely seriously attrited the 1st and 3rd Regiments in the spring of 1780, who amalgamated into a single unit. Following the capture of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on 12 May 1780, the remnants tried to regroup and reconstitute in Virginia and North Carolina. In August 1780, Armand's Legion was with [[Horatio Gates|General Gates]] at the disastrous [[Battle of Camden]].\n\nThe most significant engagement of the war involving Continental light dragoons was the [[Battle of Cowpens]] in January 1781. Southern theater commander General [[Nathanael Greene]] reorganized part of Lee's Legion and elements of the amalgamated 1st and 3rd Light Dragoons in Charlotte and dispatched them on a series of raids against Loyalist forces in western Carolina. The British responded by organizing a large force of dragoons and infantry under British Lt-Col [[Banastre Tarleton]] to stop the raids and put down the mobile forces. The dragoons joined the \"flying corps\" commanded by General [[Daniel Morgan]] at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], charged the advancing lines of Tarleton's infantry, broke their ranks, and secured a crucial victory. Later, the 3rd Legionary Corps participated in Greene's maneuvers across North Carolina and fought well against Cornwallis's army at [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse|Guilford Courthouse]].\n\nIn January 1781, the practice of the dragoons employing both mounted and dismounted troops resulted in their official reconfiguration as Legionary Corps, the mounted dragoons supported by dismounted dragoons armed as infantry, an organization that persisted until the war's end. In 1783, the Continental Army was discharged and the dragoons were released.\n\n=== War of 1812 ===\n{{Main|War of 1812}}\nThe first cavalry unit formed by the [[Congress of the United States of America]] (along with three new regular infantry regiments) was a squadron of light dragoons commanded by Major [[Michael Rudolph]] on 5 March 1792. Its four troops were assigned to each of the four sublegions of [[Legion of the United States]], by September 1792. In 1796, the number of troops was reduced to only two, which were almagamated in 1798 with six newly raised troops to the Regiment of [[Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. This mounted force was short lived as well and saw its end in 1800. The oldest two \"veterans\" troops were retained until June 1802. Hence no regular mounted soldiers existed for the next six years.<ref>Francis Bernard Heitman, ''Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army: From its Organization, September 29,1789, to March 2, 1903'', Vol.1, Washington Government Printing Office 1903,  p. 79</ref>\n\nIn 1798, during the [[Quasi-War]] with France, Congress established a three-year \"[[Provisional Army of the United States|Provisional Army]]\" of 10,000 men, consisting of twelve regiments of infantry and six troops of light dragoons. By march 1799 Congress created an \"Eventual Army\" of 30,0000 men, including three regiments of cavalry. Both \"armies\" existed only on paper, but equipment for 3,000 men and horses was procured and stored.<ref>Gregory J.W.Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry: An Illustrated History, 1776-1944'', University of Oklahoma Press 2003 (1983), pp. 36\u201439</ref> \n\nThe Congressional act of 12 April 1808 authorized a standing regiment of light dragoons consisting of eight troops. As war loomed, Congress authorized another regiment of light dragoons on 11 January 1812. These regiments were respectively known afterwards as the First and Second United States Dragoons.\n\nIn 1813, Secretary of War [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] granted Colonel [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] permission to raise two battalions of volunteer cavalry. Johnson recruited 1,200 men, divided into 14 companies. In autumn, after much training, Johnson's Volunteers, as they had come to be called, clashed with the British 45th Foot along the Thames River, 90 miles east of Detroit. The training and the tactical leadership of Col. Johnson resulted in the surrender of the British.\n\nCongress combined the First and Second United States Dragoons into one Regiment of Light Dragoons on 30 March 1814. This was a cost-cutting measure; it was cheaper and easier to maintain one unit at full strength than two organizations that could not maintain a full complement of riders. The signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] at the end of the year ended the war. The regiment was disbanded on 3 March 1815, with the explanation that cavalry forces were too expensive to maintain as part of a standing army. The retained officers and men were folded into the Corps of Artillery by 15 June 1815, all others were discharged.\n\n=== Westward expansion ===\nIn 1832, Congress formed the [[United States Mounted Rangers|Battalion of Mounted Rangers]] to protect settlers along the east bank of the Mississippi River and to keep the Santa Fe trail open. The battalion comprised volunteers organized into six companies of 100 men. To correct what was perceived as a lack of discipline, organization and reliability, Congress formed the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|United States Regiment of Dragoons]] as a regular force in 1833, consisting of 10 companies (designated A through K) with a total of 750 men. The Regiment fought against the Seminole nation in 1835, when [[Osceola|Chief Osceola]] led warriors from his tribe in the [[Second Seminole War]] in protest to the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]]. For a year, the established units had difficulty containing the Indians. Congress responded by establishing the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd United States Regiment of Dragoons]] in 1836.\n\n=== War with Mexico ===\n[[File:Remember Your Regiment, U.S. Army in Action Series, 2d Dragoons charge in Mexican War 1846.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Charles A. May]]'s squadron of the 2d Dragoons slashes through the Mexican Army lines.]]\n{{Main|Thornton Affair}} {{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n\nThe First Dragoons served in the Mexican War, and [[Charles A. May]]'s squadron of the [[Second Dragoons]] helped decide the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]].\n\n=== Civil War ===\n{{Main|Cavalry in the American Civil War}}\nShortly before the outbreak of the Civil War, the Army's dragoon regiments were designated as \"Cavalry\", losing their previous distinctions. The change was an unpopular one and the former dragoons retained their orange braided blue jackets until they wore out and had to be replaced with cavalry yellow. The 1st United States Cavalry fought in virtually every campaign in the north during the American Civil War.\n\n=== Indian wars ===\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\nThe U.S. Cavalry played a prominent role in the [[American Indian Wars]], particularly in the [[American Old West]]. Particularly notable were the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]], associated with General [[George Armstrong Custer]] and the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], and the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. Infantry units, called by the Indians \"walkaheaps\", were also involved and in some cases were the main force deployed. Infantry, when mounted, were called \"mounted infantry\"; they lacked training and skill in horsemanship and cavalry tactics.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Unioniste Lefaucheux.jpg|A US Civil war soldier  Cavalry [North] with sabre and Lefaucheux pistol; the brass guards on his shoulders were designed to protect against sword cuts\nFile:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|Company \"A\" 1st US Cavalry Sgt wearing [[Hardee hat]], 1866\nFile:USCavalryFieldUniforms1876.gif|U.S. Army poster illustrating field uniforms circa 1876\nFile:RemingtonUSCavalryChristmasBeefRoast.jpg|Roasting the Christmas Beef, [[Frederic Remington]], ''Harper's Weekly'', 24 December 1892\nFile:Cavalry soldier monument, Las Animas, CO IMG 5721.JPG|\"Cavalry Soldier\" sculpture, [[Bent County, Colorado|Bent County]] Courthouse in [[Las Animas, Colorado]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== Spanish\u2013American War ===\nSeveral Cavalry regiments served in Cuba, the 1st, 2d, 3rd Cavalry Regiments along with the African-American 9th and 10th Cavalry and also the 1st US Voluntary Cavalry, the [[Rough Riders]]. Of all the cavalry regiments, only the 3rd went to Cuba with their normal complement of horses. For the rest, only the officers' horses went as there was not enough room on the ship to bring all the horses to Cuba, and those that were not used by the officers were used to pull equipment. Likewise, all of the cavalry units except the mounted 3rd Cavalry were organized into two brigades that made up the Cavalry Division led by former Confederate cavalryman, General [[Joseph Wheeler]]. Wheeler's Cavalry Division was part of the other 2 infantry divisions and independent brigade that made up the V Corps headed by General Shafter. Several other cavalry regiments from the West Coast were sent to Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Units of Wheeler's Cavalry Division fought at both the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on 24 June 1898 and the [[Battle of San Juan Heights]] on 1 July 1898.\n\n=== World War I ===\n[[File:MountUSArmyCavalrymanYNP.jpg|thumb|Cavalryman circa World War I era]]\nThe [[15th Cavalry Division (United States)|15th Cavalry Division]] was created in February 1917 at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas. It numbered in succession of the 1st\u201314th Divisions, which were not all active at its creation. Originally trained for deployment to Europe, its units were later converted into field artillery units. The division was deactivated on 12 May 1918. Its personnel and other assets were later used to form 1st & 2nd Cavalry Divisions. On 20 August 1921, as a result of lessons learned from World War I, the Army's [[Adjutant General]], [[Major General]] [[Peter C. Harris]], constituted the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions to meet future mobilization requirements. However, the 2nd Cavalry Division was not subsequently activated, and remained in 'on-paper' organizational limbo for twenty years.\n\nIn 1921 the formation of the National Guard 21st through 24th Cavalry Divisions began with the [[First United States Army|First]], [[Second United States Army|Second]], and [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] Areas supporting the [[21st Cavalry Division (United States)|21st]], [[22nd Cavalry Division (United States)|22nd]], and [[24th Cavalry Division (United States)|24th]], respectively. The 23d was the nation's at-large cavalry division, supported by all army areas (Alabama, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin Army National Guards). In a short time the divisions had the prescribed cavalry regiments and machine gun squadrons but not the majority of their support organizations.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/M-F/chapter4.htm#b2 Maneuver and Firepower], Chapter 4</ref> To create the Organized Reserve cavalry divisions, the War Department added the [[61st Cavalry Division (United States)|61st]], [[62nd Cavalry Division (United States)|62nd]]; [[63rd Cavalry Division (United States)|63rd]]; [[64th Cavalry Division (United States)|64th]], [[65th Cavalry Division (United States)|65th]] and [[66th Cavalry Division (United States)|66th Cavalry Divisions]] to the rolls of the Army on 15 October 1921.\n\nIn 1927, the adjutant general constituted one regular army, one cavalry corps, and three army corps headquarters. In addition, the [[3rd Cavalry Division (United States)|3rd Cavalry Division]], a new Regular Army formation, was added to the rolls to complete the cavalry corps.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/M-F/chapter5.html Maneuver and Firepower], Chapter 5</ref>  No army corps, cavalry corps, or army headquarters was organized at that time, but moving these units in the mobilization plans from the Organized Reserve to the Regular Army theoretically made it easier to organize the units in an emergency.\n\nIn 1922 the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)]], [[Philippine Scouts]], was formed in the Philippines.\n\nIn the midst of the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential campaign]] prominent black leaders complained bitterly to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the limited number of black units. Under political pressure the Army activated the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Cavalry Division]] at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas, on 1 April 1941, with one white and one black brigade.<ref>Maneuver and Firepower</ref> The black brigade, the [[4th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|4th Cavalry Brigade]] was activated during February 1941 with the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]], the '[[Buffalo Soldiers]],' as its cavalry regiments. In addition, a further black cavalry regiment, the [[27th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|27th Cavalry Regiment (Colored)]], 2nd Cavalry Division, was also activated in April 1941.\n\n== Post-World War I ==\nProponents of horse cavalry argued that the lack of success of cavalry on World War I's static defensive lines had been an exception, and that cavalry still had a role to play in warfare, even as the U.S. Army's mechanization continued.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stubbs |first1=Mary Lee |last2=Connor |first2=Stanley Russell |date=1969 |title=Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry |volume=Part I: Regular Army and Army Reserve |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/arcav/arcav.htm |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History |pages=52\u201353 |ref={{sfnRef|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}}}</ref>\n\nThe American Expeditionary Forces convened a Cavalry Board to consider the future of horse cavalry; this panel concluded that the employment of large cavalry units was probably obsolete, but that horse cavalry units of regiment size and below could be attached to infantry and armor units for reconnaissance and similar missions on an as needed basis.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}  The Army accepted this recommendation, and continued to field horse cavalry units in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}\n\nAs part of the [[National Defense Act of 1920]], the Army created the Office of the Chief of Cavalry; the chief would be a temporary major general, and would be empowered to supervise cavalry activities, including personnel management, equipment development and fielding, and creation and implementation of tactics, doctrine, and training.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}} [[Willard Ames Holbrook]] was appointed as the first Chief of Cavalry, and he served until 1924.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}  The individuals appointed to serve in this position included:<ref>{{cite book |last=Hewes |first=James E. |date=1975 |title=From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900\u20131963 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLp8ON2bCm8C&q=%22holbrook%22+%22craig%22+%22crosby%22+%22chief+of+cavalry%22&dq=%22holbrook%22+%22craig%22+%22crosby%22+%22chief+of+cavalry%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirwavV9d_RAhVCMSYKHd0fC80Q6AEIHjAB |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Center of Military History |page=392}}</ref>\n* [[Willard Ames Holbrook]], 1920\u20131924\n* [[Malin Craig]], 1924\u20131926\n* [[Herbert B.

Prior to World War I and the Spanish\u2013American War it had been known as the 1st Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. The 106th underwent a number of different reorganizations until 1 September 1940, when it was redesignated the 1st Squadron, [[106th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|106th Cavalry]] (Horse-Mechanized).\n\nOn 25 February 1943 the 2nd Cavalry Division was (re)activated. The 27th Cavalry Regiment was attached to the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Colored) on 25 February 1943.

One of the privates acted as the squad's [[second-in-command]] (2IC). Each set of four consisted of a squad leader or 2IC, a scout, a horseholder and a rifleman. Mounted troopers would attack with their pistols; at the command 'charge', troopers would shorten their reins, lean well forward and ride at full speed toward the enemy. Each trooper would select a victim to his immediate front and bear down on him with his pistol extended at arm's length, withholding fire until within 25 yards. When fighting on foot, troopers would dismount taking their rifles from the scabbards mounted on their horses. The horseholder would then take control of the other troopers horses in the set of four while the three dismounted troopers operated on foot.\n\nThe Horse Cavalry rifle platoon consisted of three rifle squads and a platoon headquarters. The platoon hq consisted of a lieutenant as platoon leader, a platoon sergeant, a file closer sergeant, two intelligence scouts, who also acted as messengers, and three basic privates, who replaced squad casualties.\n\nThe last horse [[cavalry charge]] by a U.S. Army cavalry unit took place against Japanese forces during the fighting in the Bataan Peninsula, Philippines, in the village of Morong on 16 January 1942, by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment]] of the Philippine Scouts. Shortly thereafter, the besieged combined United States-Philippine forces were forced to slaughter their horses for food and the 26th Regiment fought on foot or in whatever scarce vehicles were available until their surrender.\n\nThe 10th Mountain Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop of the 10th Mountain Division, while not designated as U.S. Cavalry, conducted the last horse-mounted charge of any Army organization while engaged in [[Austria]] in 1945.<ref>A.B.

During the war, many of the Army's cavalry units were mechanized with tanks and reconnaissance vehicles, while others fought dismounted as infantry. Some units were converted into other types of units entirely, some of which made use of the cavalry's experience with horses. The Mars Men of the [[China Burma India Theater]] give such an example.\n\nThe principal reconnaissance element of an Infantry Division was a mechanized cavalry troop, whilst an armored division was provided with a full cavalry squadron. Several cavalry groups, each of two squadrons, were formed to serve as the reconnaissance elements for U.S. corps headquarters in the European Theater of Operations during 1944\u201345.\n\n[[File:M24 May 1945.jpg|thumb| The new M24 Chaffee light tank that was issued to the [[106th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|106th Cavalry Group]] in February 1945. Its 75&nbsp;mm gun was vastly superior to the [[Stuart tank|M5A1 Stuart]] tank.]]\nBesides HQ and service elements, each cavalry troop comprised three cavalry platoons, each of which was equipped with six [[Willys MB|Bantam jeeps]] and three [[M8 Greyhound]] armored cars.<ref name=\"bayonet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/Reconnaissance/united_states_cavalry_reconnaiss.htm|title=The United States Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized| accessdate=2 December 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080801081611/http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/Reconnaissance/united_states_cavalry_reconnaiss.htm |archivedate = 1 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThree of the jeeps were mounted with a [[M2 Mortar|60mm mortar]] manned by two soldiers; the other three had a bracket-mounted [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.30 caliber machine gun]], manned by a soldier sitting in the front passenger seat \u2013 although sometimes the M1919 was replaced by a [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 caliber machine gun]].

It also featured a .30 caliber coaxial machine gun that could move independently of the turret. The M8 was equipped with powerful FM radios to enable battlefield communications.\n\nA cavalry squadron comprised a HQ Troop, three cavalry troops (four for those in armored divisions), a light tank company and an assault gun troop.\n\nThe light tank company had 17 tanks; two in the company headquarters and three platoons of five tanks. Initially, the tanks were [[M3 Stuart]]s, later M5 Stuarts; both of which were equipped with [[37 mm Gun M3|37mm]] guns. The Stuart was capable of speeds of up to {{convert|36|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the road. While fast and maneuverable, its armor plating and cannon were soon found to be no match for the German tanks. In February 1945 they were replaced with the [[M24 Chaffee]] light tank, which was equipped with a [[75 mm gun (US)#M6|75&nbsp;mm]] gun.<ref name=\"bayonet\" />\n\nThe assault gun troop comprised three assault gun platoons (four for those in armored divisions), each with two [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8|M8 HMCs]] \u2013 M5 Stuarts with their turrets replaced by an open-turreted 75&nbsp;mm howitzer \u2013 and two [[M3 Half-track]]s; one for the platoon HQ, the other for the ammunition section.\n\nThe experience gained in the use of the mechanized cavalry groups during World War II led to the eventual postwar formation of armored cavalry regiments to act as corps reconnaissance and screening elements.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nThe Vietnam War saw the first combat use of [[Cavalry tactics#Cavalry in modern warfare|air cavalry]] warfare; and twenty armored and air cavalry units were deployed to Vietnam during the war. Armored cavalry units in Vietnam were initially equipped with the [[M48 Patton#Variants|M48A3 Patton tank]], armed with a 90&nbsp;mm main gun, and the [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle]] (ACAV). In January 1969, the cavalry began transitioning from the Patton tank to the [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Airborne Reconnaissance Assault Vehicle.<ref>Starry, p. 142</ref> By 1970, all armored cavalry units in Vietnam were operating the Sheridan except for the tank companies of the 11th ACR, which continued to use Patton tanks.<ref>Starry, p. 227-234</ref>\n\n====U.

Today's modern 1\u20131st Cavalry is a scout/attack unit, equipped with [[M1 Abrams|M1A1 Abrams tanks]] and [[M2 Bradley|M3 Bradley CFVs]].\n\nAnother modern U.S. Army unit informally known as the 2nd Dragoons is the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Cavalry Regiment (Stryker)]]. This unit was originally organized as the Second Dragoon Regiment in 1836 until it was renamed the Second Cavalry Regiment in 1860, morphing into the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the 1960s. The regiment is currently equipped with the [[Stryker (vehicle)|Stryker]] family of wheeled fighting vehicles. As equipped with the Stryker, the 2nd Cavalry once again can be accurately referred to as a \"dragoon\" force \u2013 mounted infantry.<ref>US Army Europe Fact Files \u2013 Second Stryker Cavalry Regiment, http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/factfiles/factfile_history-002scr_2007-10.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Traditions ===\nThe cavalry, like any other military force, has its own unique traditions and history. These traditions include the [[Order of the Spur]]; Spurs are issued to cavalry soldiers in Gold, for the completion of a tour of combat service and in Silver for the completion of what is commonly called the \"Spur Ride.\" The Cavalry traditions also include: the [[Stetson]], Stetson Cords, [[Fiddler's Green]] poem, and the Order of the Yellow Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Units in the modern Army with the armor and cavalry designation have adopted the black Stetson hat as unofficial semi dress headgear, recalling the black felt campaign hats of the American frontier era. Where as the Quarter-Cav still wears the brown felt Stetsons.\n\n=== Cavalry designation ===\nThe distinct cavalry branch ceased to exist when it was absorbed into the Armor branch in 1951, during the Korean War. Other regiments of both armored and air cavalry exist in the Army. The patches on 1st Cavalry Division helicopters that served in Vietnam retained the symbol of a horse, symbolizing the mobility that characterized the original horse cavalry. In spite of the formal disbanding of the branch, however, the recognition of it continues on within the Army's armor and aviation branches, where some officers choose cavalry branch insignia over the very similar armor branch insignia or aviation \"prop and wing\" insignia.\n\nChief, the last surviving tactical horse of the United States Cavalry, died in 1968, at the age of 36.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artbycrane.com/horse_history_articles_tales/cavalryhorse.html|title=Cavalry Horse : History of Horses. HAIL TO THE CHIEF|website=www.artbycrane.com|accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere is one enlisted Army [[military occupational specialty]] in use in Cavalry units: 19D, armored cavalry reconnaissance specialist, or [[cavalry scout]]. Officers are often branch detailed either from the Armor branch or the Infantry branch to lead Cavalry soldiers.\n\nThe [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] is the only presently existing division of the Army that retains the \"cavalry\" name and the division retains [[1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment|one detachment of ceremonial horse cavalry]] for morale and ceremonial purposes. In addition to a division headquarters and headquarters battalion, division artillery, and a sustainment brigade, the division is otherwise divided into three [[Brigade combat team#Armored Brigade Combat Team|armored brigade combat teams]] and one [[Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division|combat aviation brigade]]. Both types of brigades contain subordinate units (armored cavalry squadrons and an attack/reconnaissance squadron, respectively) that perform traditional cavalry tasks.\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n* Branch insignia:\n*: Two crossed sabers in scabbards, cutting edge up, 11/16-inch in height, of gold color metal. The cavalry insignia was adopted in 1851. Officers and enlisted personnel assigned to cavalry regiments, cavalry squadrons or separate cavalry troops are authorized to wear the cavalry collar insignia in lieu of their insignia of branch when approved by the MACOM commander. Some of the armor and aviation units are designated cavalry units.\n* Branch plaque:\n*: The plaque design has the Cavalry insignia and rim in gold. The background is white and the letters are scarlet.\n* Regimental insignia:\n*: Personnel assigned to cavalry units affiliate with a specific regiment of their branch or cavalry unit and wear the insignia of the affiliated regiment.\n* Regimental coat of arms:\n*: There is no standard cavalry regimental flag to represent all of the cavalry regiments. Each cavalry regiment has its own coat of arms that is displayed on the breast of a displayed eagle. The background of all cavalry regimental flags is yellow, and they have yellow fringes.\n* Branch colors:\n*: Yellow is the Cavalry branch color. In March 1855, two regiments of cavalry were created and their trimmings were to be \"yellow.\" In 1861, the designation of dragoon and mounted rifleman disappeared, all becoming troopers with \"yellow\" as their colors. Yellow was continued as the color for armor and cavalry units subsequent to disbanding as a branch. Although the regimental flags for cavalry units are yellow, the troop guidons are red and white without an insignia on the guidon.\n\n=== U.S. Army cavalrymen ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* [[Adna Chaffee, Jr.]]\n* [[Adna R.

This was replaced by the U.S. ''Tank Corps'' which lasted until 1921.  No U.S. tank force existed (they were assigned to infantry/cavalry outfits) until the Armored Forces was created in 1940. This was replaced by the current armor branch of today in 1950.</ref> with [[tank]]s in 1940, but the term \"cavalry\", e.g. \"armored cavalry\", remains in use in the U.S. Army for mounted (ground and aviation) [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)|reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA) units based on their parent [[Combat Arms Regimental System]] (CARS) regiment. ''Cavalry'' is also used in the name of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] for heraldic/lineage/historical purposes. Some [[Brigade Combat Team#Armored Brigade Combat Team|combined arms battalions]] (i.e., consisting of a combination of tank and mechanized infantry companies) are designated as ''armor'' formations, while others are designated as [[Infantry Branch (United States)|''infantry'']] organizations. These [[Structure of the United States Army#Branches and Functional Areas|\"branch\"]] designations are again, heraldic/lineage/historical titles derived from the CARS regiments to which the battalions are assigned.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] (1846\u20131848) \"had resulted in adding a vast territory to our national domain, and the government was bound, in the interests of civilization, to open this immense area to settlement...the country between the Missouri River and California... was occupied by powerful and warlike tribes of Indians.\"  But the size of the army had remained fixed. In 1855, at the request of General [[Winfield Scott]] Congress added the 1st and 2nd Cavalry regiments to the U.S. Army.<ref>Price (1883) pp. 14, 21</ref>\n\nCongress originally created the 1st U.S. Dragoons in 1833. The 2nd U.S. Dragoons, and the U.S. Mounted Riflemen followed in 1836 and 1846 respectively.<ref name=\"Price 1883 p. 12\">Price (1883) p. 12</ref><ref>Grant (2009) p. 23, \"I was anxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called...\"</ref>  Prior to \"1833 mounted troops were raised (in 1808 and 1812) as emergencies presented themselves and were disbanded as soon as these had passed.\"<ref name=\"Price 1883 p. 12\"/><ref>Smith (2001) p. 1, \"...There existed among the people of the United States a strong prejudice against maintaining even a small regular army in time of peace.\"</ref>  Often the newly designated forces were influenced after cavalry units employed during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), especially by the opposing well-supplied  mounted dragoons units of the [[British Army|King's Army (British Army)]], especially used with great effectiveness in the Southern Theater of the [[Carolinas]] in the latter part of the war. The traditions of the U.S. Cavalry originated with the horse-mounted force which played an important role in extending United States governance into the [[Western United States]], especially after the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), with the need to cover vast ranges of territory between scattered isolated forts and outposts of the minimal resources given to the stretched thin U.S. Army.\n\nSignificant numbers of horse mounted units participated in later foreign conflicts in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, and in the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] battlefields of [[Europe]] in [[World War I]] (1917\u20131918), although numbers and roles declined.\n\nImmediately preceding [[World War II]] (1941\u20131945), the U.S. Cavalry began transitioning to a mechanized, mounted force. During the Second World War, the Army's cavalry units operated as horse-mounted, mechanized, or dismounted forces (infantry). The last horse-mounted cavalry charge by a U.S. Cavalry unit took place on the [[Bataan]] Peninsula, in the [[Philippines]] in early 1942. The [[26th Cavalry Regiment]] of the allied [[Philippine Scouts]] executed the charge against [[Imperial Japanese Army]] forces near the village of Morong on 16 January 1942.<ref>Afterward, the besieged, combined United States-Philippine force was forced to slaughter their horses for food, and the 26th Regiment continued to fight on foot as guerillas until their surrender.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Cavalry branch was absorbed into the Armor branch as part of the Army Reorganization Act of 1950. The [[Vietnam War]] saw the introduction of helicopters and operations as a helicopter-borne force with the designation of [[air cavalry|'''Air Cavalry''']], while mechanized cavalry received the designation of '''Armored Cavalry'''.\nToday, cavalry designations and traditions continue with regiments of both armor and aviation units that perform the cavalry mission. The [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] is the only active [[Division (military)|division]] in the United States Army with a cavalry designation. The division maintains a detachment of horse-mounted cavalry for ceremonial purposes.\n\n== History ==\n\nWashington saw the intimidating effect of the small force of [[17th Lancers|British 17th Light Dragoons]], which panicked his militia infantry at [[Battle of White Plains|White Plains]]. Appreciating the ability of the 5th Regiment of Connecticut Light Horse Militia, under Major Elisha Sheldon, to gather intelligence during the subsequent retreat of Continental forces into New Jersey, he asked the Continental Congress for a light cavalry force in the Continental army. In late 1776, Congress authorized Washington to establish a mounted force of 3,000 men.\n\n=== American Revolutionary War ===\n{{Main|American Revolutionary War}}\n\nOn 12 December 1776, Congress converted Elisha Sheldon's militia regiment into the [[2nd Continental Light Dragoons|Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. In March 1777, Washington established the Corps of Continental Light Dragoons consisting of four regiments of 280 men, each organised in six troops. Many problems faced the light dragoon regiments, including the inability of recruiting to bring the units to authorized strength, shortage of suitable cavalry weapons and horses, and lack of uniformity among troopers in dress and discipline. Congress appointed the Hungarian revolutionary and professional soldier [[Michael Kovats]] and the Polish [[Kazimierz Pulaski|Casimir Pulaski]] to train them as an offensive strike force during winter quarters of 1777\u201378 at Trenton, New Jersey.\n\n[[File:Kazimierz Pulaski.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Poland|Polish]] nobleman and soldier [[Casimir Pulaski]] was one of the founders and \"fathers of American cavalry\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=24tzlsTt164C&pg=PA1&dq=pulaski+father+of+american+cavalry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIuJq_9LrhAhVHeH0KHfYwCqI4ChDoAQg2MAI#v=onepage&q=pulaski+father+of+american+cavalry&f=false|title=Casmir Pulaski|first=Carole|last=Marsh|date=30 September 2002|publisher=Gallopade International|accessdate=6 April 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>]]\n\nPulaski's efforts led to friction with the American officers, resulting in his resignation, but Congress authorized Pulaski to form his own independent corps in 1778. Pulaski's Legion consisted of dragoons, riflemen, grenadiers, and infantry. Another independent corps of dragoons joined Pulaski's in the Continental Line during 1778 when a former captain in Bland's Horse, [[Henry Lee III|\"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]], formed [[Lee's Legion|Lee's Corps of Partisan Light Dragoons]], which specialized in raiding British supply lines. Colonel [[Charles Armand Tuffin, marquis de la Rou\u00ebrie]] (\"Col. Armand\"), a French nobleman, raised a third corps of infantry in Boston, called the Free and Independent Chasseurs, which later added a troop of dragoons, becoming [[Armand's Legion]]. Although a reorganization in 1778 authorized expansion of the four regiments to 415 men each, forage difficulties, expiration of enlistments, desertions, and other problems made this impossible, and no regiment ever carried more than 200 men on its rolls, and they averaged 120 to 180 men between 1778 and 1780.\n\nIn 1779, Washington ordered the 2nd and [[4th Continental Light Dragoons]] equipped temporarily as infantry, and deployed the [[1st Continental Light Dragoons|1st]] and [[3rd Continental Light Dragoons]] and [[Pulaski's Legion]] to the South to join local militia cavalry and to oppose the new British strategy for controlling that area. Battle engagements in South Carolina largely seriously attrited the 1st and 3rd Regiments in the spring of 1780, who amalgamated into a single unit. Following the capture of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] on 12 May 1780, the remnants tried to regroup and reconstitute in Virginia and North Carolina. In August 1780, Armand's Legion was with [[Horatio Gates|General Gates]] at the disastrous [[Battle of Camden]].\n\nThe most significant engagement of the war involving Continental light dragoons was the [[Battle of Cowpens]] in January 1781. Southern theater commander General [[Nathanael Greene]] reorganized part of Lee's Legion and elements of the amalgamated 1st and 3rd Light Dragoons in Charlotte and dispatched them on a series of raids against Loyalist forces in western Carolina. The British responded by organizing a large force of dragoons and infantry under British Lt-Col [[Banastre Tarleton]] to stop the raids and put down the mobile forces. The dragoons joined the \"flying corps\" commanded by General [[Daniel Morgan]] at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], charged the advancing lines of Tarleton's infantry, broke their ranks, and secured a crucial victory. Later, the 3rd Legionary Corps participated in Greene's maneuvers across North Carolina and fought well against Cornwallis's army at [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse|Guilford Courthouse]].\n\nIn January 1781, the practice of the dragoons employing both mounted and dismounted troops resulted in their official reconfiguration as Legionary Corps, the mounted dragoons supported by dismounted dragoons armed as infantry, an organization that persisted until the war's end. In 1783, the Continental Army was discharged and the dragoons were released.\n\n=== War of 1812 ===\n{{Main|War of 1812}}\nThe first cavalry unit formed by the [[Congress of the United States of America]] (along with three new regular infantry regiments) was a squadron of light dragoons commanded by Major [[Michael Rudolph]] on 5 March 1792. Its four troops were assigned to each of the four sublegions of [[Legion of the United States]], by September 1792. In 1796, the number of troops was reduced to only two, which were almagamated in 1798 with six newly raised troops to the Regiment of [[Regiment of Light Dragoons (United States)|Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. This mounted force was short lived as well and saw its end in 1800. The oldest two \"veterans\" troops were retained until June 1802. Hence no regular mounted soldiers existed for the next six years.<ref>Francis Bernard Heitman, ''Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army: From its Organization, September 29,1789, to March 2, 1903'', Vol.1, Washington Goverment Printing Office 1903,  p. 79</ref>\n\nIn 1798, during the [[Quasi-War]] with France, Congress established a three-year \"[[Provisional Army of the United States|Provisional Army]]\" of 10,000 men, consisting of twelve regiments of infantry and six troops of light dragoons. By march 1799 Congress created an \"Eventual Army\" of 30,0000 men, including three regiments of cavalry. Both \"armies\" existed only on paper, but equipment for 3,000 men and horses was procured and stored.<ref>Gregory J.W.Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry: An Illustrated History, 1776-1944'', University of Oklahoma Press 2003 (1983), pp. 36\u201439</ref> \n\nThe Congressional act of 12 April 1808 authorized a standing regiment of light dragoons consisting of eight troops. As war loomed, Congress authorized another regiment of light dragoons on 11 January 1812. These regiments were respectively known afterwards as the First and Second United States Dragoons.\n\nIn 1813, Secretary of War [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] granted Colonel [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] permission to raise two battalions of volunteer cavalry. Johnson recruited 1,200 men, divided into 14 companies. In autumn, after much training, Johnson's Volunteers, as they had come to be called, clashed with the British 45th Foot along the Thames River, 90 miles east of Detroit. The training and the tactical leadership of Col. Johnson resulted in the surrender of the British.\n\nCongress combined the First and Second United States Dragoons into one Regiment of Light Dragoons on 30 March 1814. This was a cost-cutting measure; it was cheaper and easier to maintain one unit at full strength than two organizations that could not maintain a full complement of riders. The signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] at the end of the year ended the war. The regiment was disbanded on 3 March 1815, with the explanation that cavalry forces were too expensive to maintain as part of a standing army. The retained officers and men were folded into the Corps of Artillery by 15 June 1815, all others were discharged.\n\n=== Westward expansion ===\nIn 1832, Congress formed the [[United States Mounted Rangers|Battalion of Mounted Rangers]] to protect settlers along the east bank of the Mississippi River and to keep the Santa Fe trail open. The battalion comprised volunteers organized into six companies of 100 men. To correct what was perceived as a lack of discipline, organization and reliability, Congress formed the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|United States Regiment of Dragoons]] as a regular force in 1833, consisting of 10 companies (designated A through K) with a total of 750 men. The Regiment fought against the Seminole nation in 1835, when [[Osceola|Chief Osceola]] led warriors from his tribe in the [[Second Seminole War]] in protest to the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]]. For a year, the established units had difficulty containing the Indians. Congress responded by establishing the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd United States Regiment of Dragoons]] in 1836.\n\n=== War with Mexico ===\n[[File:Remember Your Regiment, U.S. Army in Action Series, 2d Dragoons charge in Mexican War 1846.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Charles A. May]]'s squadron of the 2d Dragoons slashes through the Mexican Army lines.]]\n{{Main|Thornton Affair}} {{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n\nThe First Dragoons served in the Mexican War, and [[Charles A. May]]'s squadron of the [[Second Dragoons]] helped decide the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]].\n\n=== Civil War ===\n{{Main|Cavalry in the American Civil War}}\nShortly before the outbreak of the Civil War, the Army's dragoon regiments were designated as \"Cavalry\", losing their previous distinctions. The change was an unpopular one and the former dragoons retained their orange braided blue jackets until they wore out and had to be replaced with cavalry yellow. The 1st United States Cavalry fought in virtually every campaign in the north during the American Civil War.\n\n=== Indian wars ===\n{{Main|American Indian Wars}}\nThe U.S. Cavalry played a prominent role in the [[American Indian Wars]], particularly in the [[American Old West]]. Particularly notable were the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]], associated with General [[George Armstrong Custer]] and the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], and the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s. Infantry units, called by the Indians \"walkaheaps\", were also involved and in some cases were the main force deployed. Infantry, when mounted, were called \"mounted infantry\"; they lacked training and skill in horsemanship and cavalry tactics.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Unioniste Lefaucheux.jpg|A US Civil war soldier  Cavalry [North] with sabre and Lefaucheux pistol; the brass guards on his shoulders were designed to protect against sword cuts\nFile:US Army Cavalry Sergeant 1866 (Bis).jpg|Company \"A\" 1st US Cavalry Sgt wearing [[Hardee hat]], 1866\nFile:USCavalryFieldUniforms1876.gif|U.S. Army poster illustrating field uniforms circa 1876\nFile:RemingtonUSCavalryChristmasBeefRoast.jpg|Roasting the Christmas Beef, [[Frederic Remington]], ''Harper's Weekly'', 24 December 1892\nFile:Cavalry soldier monument, Las Animas, CO IMG 5721.JPG|\"Cavalry Soldier\" sculpture, [[Bent County, Colorado|Bent County]] Courthouse in [[Las Animas, Colorado]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== Spanish\u2013American War ===\nSeveral Cavalry regiments served in Cuba, the 1st, 2d, 3rd Cavalry Regiments along with the African-American 9th and 10th Cavalry and also the 1st US Voluntary Cavalry, the [[Rough Riders]]. Of all the cavalry regiments, only the 3rd went to Cuba with their normal complement of horses. For the rest, only the officers' horses went as there was not enough room on the ship to bring all the horses to Cuba, and those that were not used by the officers were used to pull equipment. Likewise, all of the cavalry units except the mounted 3rd Cavalry were organized into two brigades that made up the Cavalry Division led by former Confederate cavalryman, General [[Joseph Wheeler]]. Wheeler's Cavalry Division was part of the other 2 infantry divisions and independent brigade that made up the V Corps headed by General Shafter. Several other cavalry regiments from the West Coast were sent to Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Units of Wheeler's Cavalry Division fought at both the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on 24 June 1898 and the [[Battle of San Juan Heights]] on 1 July 1898.\n\n=== World War I ===\n[[File:MountUSArmyCavalrymanYNP.jpg|thumb|Cavalryman circa World War I era]]\nThe [[15th Cavalry Division (United States)|15th Cavalry Division]] was created in February 1917 at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas. It numbered in succession of the 1st\u201314th Divisions, which were not all active at its creation. Originally trained for deployment to Europe, its units were later converted into field artillery units. The division was deactivated on 12 May 1918. Its personnel and other assets were later used to form 1st & 2nd Cavalry Divisions. On 20 August 1921, as a result of lessons learned from World War I, the Army's [[Adjutant General]], [[Major General]] [[Peter C. Harris]], constituted the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions to meet future mobilization requirements. However, the 2nd Cavalry Division was not subsequently activated, and remained in 'on-paper' organizational limbo for twenty years.\n\nIn 1921 the formation of the National Guard 21st through 24th Cavalry Divisions began with the [[First United States Army|First]], [[Second United States Army|Second]], and [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] Areas supporting the [[21st Cavalry Division (United States)|21st]], [[22nd Cavalry Division (United States)|22nd]], and [[24th Cavalry Division (United States)|24th]], respectively. The 23d was the nation's at-large cavalry division, supported by all army areas (Alabama, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin Army National Guards). In a short time the divisions had the prescribed cavalry regiments and machine gun squadrons but not the majority of their support organizations.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/M-F/chapter4.htm#b2 Maneuver and Firepower], Chapter 4</ref> To create the Organized Reserve cavalry divisions, the War Department added the [[61st Cavalry Division (United States)|61st]], [[62nd Cavalry Division (United States)|62nd]]; [[63rd Cavalry Division (United States)|63rd]]; [[64th Cavalry Division (United States)|64th]], [[65th Cavalry Division (United States)|65th]] and [[66th Cavalry Division (United States)|66th Cavalry Divisions]] to the rolls of the Army on 15 October 1921.\n\nIn 1927, the adjutant general constituted one regular army, one cavalry corps, and three army corps headquarters. In addition, the [[3rd Cavalry Division (United States)|3rd Cavalry Division]], a new Regular Army formation, was added to the rolls to complete the cavalry corps.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/M-F/chapter5.html Maneuver and Firepower], Chapter 5</ref>  No army corps, cavalry corps, or army headquarters was organized at that time, but moving these units in the mobilization plans from the Organized Reserve to the Regular Army theoretically made it easier to organize the units in an emergency.\n\nIn 1922 the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)]], [[Philippine Scouts]], was formed in the Philippines.\n\nIn the midst of the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential campaign]] prominent black leaders complained bitterly to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the limited number of black units. Under political pressure the Army activated the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Cavalry Division]] at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas, on 1 April 1941, with one white and one black brigade.<ref>Maneuver and Firepower</ref> The black brigade, the [[4th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|4th Cavalry Brigade]] was activated during February 1941 with the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]], the '[[Buffalo Soldiers]],' as its cavalry regiments. In addition, a further black cavalry regiment, the [[27th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|27th Cavalry Regiment (Colored)]], 2nd Cavalry Division, was also activated in April 1941.\n\n== Post-World War I ==\nProponents of horse cavalry argued that the lack of success of cavalry on World War I's static defensive lines had been an exception, and that cavalry still had a role to play in warfare, even as the U.S. Army's mechanization continued.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stubbs |first1=Mary Lee |last2=Connor |first2=Stanley Russell |date=1969 |title=Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry |volume=Part I: Regular Army and Army Reserve |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/arcav/arcav.htm |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History |pages=52\u201353 |ref={{sfnRef|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}}}</ref>\n\nThe American Expeditionary Forces convened a Cavalry Board to consider the future of horse cavalry; this panel concluded that the employment of large cavalry units was probably obsolete, but that horse cavalry units of regiment size and below could be attached to infantry and armor units for reconnaissance and similar missions on an as needed basis.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}  The Army accepted this recommendation, and continued to field horse cavalry units in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}\n\nAs part of the [[National Defense Act of 1920]], the Army created the Office of the Chief of Cavalry; the chief would be a temporary major general, and would be empowered to supervise cavalry activities, including personnel management, equipment development and fielding, and creation and implementation of tactics, doctrine, and training.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}} [[Willard Ames Holbrook]] was appointed as the first Chief of Cavalry, and he served until 1924.{{sfn|''Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry''}}  The individuals appointed to serve in this position included:<ref>{{cite book |last=Hewes |first=James E. |date=1975 |title=From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration, 1900\u20131963 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLp8ON2bCm8C&q=%22holbrook%22+%22craig%22+%22crosby%22+%22chief+of+cavalry%22&dq=%22holbrook%22+%22craig%22+%22crosby%22+%22chief+of+cavalry%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirwavV9d_RAhVCMSYKHd0fC80Q6AEIHjAB |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Center of Military History |page=392}}</ref>\n* [[Willard Ames Holbrook]], 1920\u20131924\n* [[Malin Craig]], 1924\u20131926\n* [[Herbert B.

Prior to World War I and the Spanish\u2013American War it had been known as the 1st Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. The 106th underwent a number of different reorganizations until 1 September 1940, when it was redesignated the 1st Squadron, [[106th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|106th Cavalry]] (Horse-Mechanized).\n\nOn 25 February 1943 the 2nd Cavalry Division was (re)activated. The 27th Cavalry Regiment was attached to the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Colored) on 25 February 1943.

One of the privates acted as the squad's [[second-in-command]] (2IC). Each set of four consisted of a squad leader or 2IC, a scout, a horseholder and a rifleman. Mounted troopers would attack with their pistols; at the command 'charge', troopers would shorten their reins, lean well forward and ride at full speed toward the enemy. Each trooper would select a victim to his immediate front and bear down on him with his pistol extended at arm's length, withholding fire until within 25 yards. When fighting on foot, troopers would dismount taking their rifles from the scabbards mounted on their horses. The horseholder would then take control of the other troopers horses in the set of four while the three dismounted troopers operated on foot.\n\nThe Horse Cavalry rifle platoon consisted of three rifle squads and a platoon headquarters. The platoon hq consisted of a lieutenant as platoon leader, a platoon sergeant, a file closer sergeant, two intelligence scouts, who also acted as messengers, and three basic privates, who replaced squad casualties.\n\nThe last horse [[cavalry charge]] by a U.S. Army cavalry unit took place against Japanese forces during the fighting in the Bataan Peninsula, Philippines, in the village of Morong on 16 January 1942, by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment]] of the Philippine Scouts. Shortly thereafter, the besieged combined United States-Philippine forces were forced to slaughter their horses for food and the 26th Regiment fought on foot or in whatever scarce vehicles were available until their surrender.\n\nThe 10th Mountain Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop of the 10th Mountain Division, while not designated as U.S. Cavalry, conducted the last horse-mounted charge of any Army organization while engaged in [[Austria]] in 1945.<ref>A.B.

During the war, many of the Army's cavalry units were mechanized with tanks and reconnaissance vehicles, while others fought dismounted as infantry. Some units were converted into other types of units entirely, some of which made use of the cavalry's experience with horses. The Mars Men of the [[China Burma India Theater]] give such an example.\n\nThe principal reconnaissance element of an Infantry Division was a mechanized cavalry troop, whilst an armored division was provided with a full cavalry squadron. Several cavalry groups, each of two squadrons, were formed to serve as the reconnaissance elements for U.S. corps headquarters in the European Theater of Operations during 1944\u201345.\n\n[[File:M24 May 1945.jpg|thumb| The new M24 Chaffee light tank that was issued to the [[106th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|106th Cavalry Group]] in February 1945.

It also featured a .30 caliber coaxial machine gun that could move independently of the turret. The M8 was equipped with powerful FM radios to enable battlefield communications.\n\nA cavalry squadron comprised a HQ Troop, three cavalry troops (four for those in armored divisions), a light tank company and an assault gun troop.\n\nThe light tank company had 17 tanks; two in the company headquarters and three platoons of five tanks. Initially, the tanks were [[M3 Stuart]]s, later M5 Stuarts; both of which were equipped with [[37 mm Gun M3|37mm]] guns. The Stuart was capable of speeds of up to {{convert|36|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the road. While fast and maneuverable, its armor plating and cannon were soon found to be no match for the German tanks. In February 1945 they were replaced with the [[M24 Chaffee]] light tank, which was equipped with a [[75 mm gun (US)#M6|75&nbsp;mm]] gun.<ref name=\"bayonet\" />\n\nThe assault gun troop comprised three assault gun platoons (four for those in armored divisions), each with two [[Howitzer Motor Carriage M8|M8 HMCs]] \u2013 M5 Stuarts with their turrets replaced by an open-turreted 75&nbsp;mm howitzer \u2013 and two [[M3 Half-track]]s; one for the platoon HQ, the other for the ammunition section.\n\nThe experience gained in the use of the mechanized cavalry groups during World War II led to the eventual postwar formation of armored cavalry regiments to act as corps reconnaissance and screening elements.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\nThe Vietnam War saw the first combat use of [[Cavalry tactics#Cavalry in modern warfare|air cavalry]] warfare; and twenty armored and air cavalry units were deployed to Vietnam during the war. Armored cavalry units in Vietnam were initially equipped with the [[M48 Patton#Variants|M48A3 Patton tank]], armed with a 90&nbsp;mm main gun, and the [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle]] (ACAV). In January 1969, the cavalry began transitioning from the Patton tank to the [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Airborne Reconnaissance Assault Vehicle.<ref>Starry, p. 142</ref> By 1970, all armored cavalry units in Vietnam were operating the Sheridan except for the tank companies of the 11th ACR, which continued to use Patton tanks.<ref>Starry, p. 227-234</ref>\n\n====U.

This unit was originally organized as the Second Dragoon Regiment in 1836 until it was renamed the Second Cavalry Regiment in 1860, morphing into the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the 1960s. The regiment is currently equipped with the [[Stryker (vehicle)|Stryker]] family of wheeled fighting vehicles.

These traditions include the [[Order of the Spur]]; Spurs are issued to cavalry soldiers in Gold, for the completion of a tour of combat service and in Silver for the completion of what is commonly called the \"Spur Ride.\" The Cavalry traditions also include: the [[Stetson]], Stetson Cords, [[Fiddler's Green]] poem, and the Order of the Yellow Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Units in the modern Army with the armor and cavalry designation have adopted the black Stetson hat as unofficial semi dress headgear, recalling the black felt campaign hats of the American frontier era. Where as the Quarter-Cav still wears the brown felt Stetsons.\n\n=== Cavalry designation ===\nThe distinct cavalry branch ceased to exist when it was absorbed into the Armor branch in 1951, during the Korean War. Other regiments of both armored and air cavalry exist in the Army. The patches on 1st Cavalry Division helicopters that served in Vietnam retained the symbol of a horse, symbolizing the mobility that characterized the original horse cavalry. In spite of the formal disbanding of the branch, however, the recognition of it continues on within the Army's armor and aviation branches, where some officers choose cavalry branch insignia over the very similar armor branch insignia or aviation \"prop and wing\" insignia.\n\nChief, the last surviving tactical horse of the United States Cavalry, died in 1968, at the age of 36.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artbycrane.com/horse_history_articles_tales/cavalryhorse.html|title=Cavalry Horse : History of Horses.

Both types of brigades contain subordinate units (armored cavalry squadrons and an attack/reconnaissance squadron, respectively) that perform traditional cavalry tasks.\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n* Branch insignia:\n*: Two crossed sabers in scabbards, cutting edge up, 11/16-inch in height, of gold color metal. The cavalry insignia was adopted in 1851. Officers and enlisted personnel assigned to cavalry regiments, cavalry squadrons or separate cavalry troops are authorized to wear the cavalry collar insignia in lieu of their insignia of branch when approved by the MACOM commander. Some of the armor and aviation units are designated cavalry units.\n* Branch plaque:\n*: The plaque design has the Cavalry insignia and rim in gold. The background is white and the letters are scarlet.\n* Regimental insignia:\n*: Personnel assigned to cavalry units affiliate with a specific regiment of their branch or cavalry unit and wear the insignia of the affiliated regiment.\n* Regimental coat of arms:\n*: There is no standard cavalry regimental flag to represent all of the cavalry regiments. Each cavalry regiment has its own coat of arms that is displayed on the breast of a displayed eagle. The background of all cavalry regimental flags is yellow, and they have yellow fringes.\n* Branch colors:\n*: Yellow is the Cavalry branch color. In March 1855, two regiments of cavalry were created and their trimmings were to be \"yellow.\" In 1861, the designation of dragoon and mounted rifleman disappeared, all becoming troopers with \"yellow\" as their colors. Yellow was continued as the color for armor and cavalry units subsequent to disbanding as a branch. Although the regimental flags for cavalry units are yellow, the troop guidons are red and white without an insignia on the guidon.\n\n=== U.S. Army cavalrymen ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* [[Adna Chaffee, Jr.]]\n* [[Adna R.
