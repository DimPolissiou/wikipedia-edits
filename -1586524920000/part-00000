Erected in the 4th century, the diocese was restored in the Concordat of 1822, and comprises the department of [[Ard\u00e8che]], in the [[Region]] of [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. Currently the diocese is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|Archdiocese of Lyon]]. Its current bishop is Jean-Louis Marie Balsa, appointed in 2015.\n\n==History==\nSaint [[And\u00e9ol]], disciple of Saint [[Polycarp]], evangelized the Vivarais under Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] and was martyred in 208.\n\nThe \"Old Charter\", drawn up in 950 by Bishop Thomas,<ref>Duchesne, pp. 235-237.</ref> the most complete document concerning the primitive Church of Viviers, mentions five bishops who lived at [[Alba Augusta]] (modern Alba-la-Romaine): [[Januarius of Viviers|Januarius]], [[Saint Septimus]], [[Saint Maspicianus]], Saint [[Melanius I of Viviers|Melanius]] and [[Saint Avolus]]. The last was a victim of the invasion of the barbarian [[Chrocus]] (the exact date of which is unknown).\n\nIn consequence of the ravages suffered by Alba Augusta, the new bishop, Saint [[Auxonius]], transferred the see to Viviers about 430. Promotus was probably the first Bishop of Viviers; the document also mentions later several canonized bishops: Saints Lucian and Valerius (fifth and sixth centuries); Saint [[Venantius Fortunatus|Venantius]], disciple of Saint [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], who was present at the councils held in 517 and 535; Saint [[Melanius II of Viviers|Melanius II]] (sixth century); saints [[Eucherius of Lyon|Eucherius]], [[Fermin|Firminus]], [[Saint Aulus|Aulus]], Eumachius, and Longinus (seventh century); [[Arcontius of Viviers|St. Arcontius]], martyr (date unknown, perhaps later than the ninth century.\n\nIt seems that the Diocese of Viviers was disputed for a long time by the metropolitan Sees of [[Vienne]] and [[Arles]]. From the eleventh century its dependence on Vienne was not contested. John II, cardinal and Bishop of Viviers (1073\u20131095), had the abbatial church of [[Cruas]] consecrated by [[Urban II]] and accompanied him to the [[Council of Clermont]].\n\nAfterwards, it is said that [[Conrad III]] gave Lower Vivaraisas to Bishop William (1147) as an independent suzerainty. In the thirteenth century, under the reign of [[St. Louis of France]], the Bishop of Viviers was obliged to recognize the jurisdiction of the Seneschal of [[Beucaire]]. By the treaty of 10 July 1305 [[Philip IV of France]] obliged the bishops of Viviers to admit the suzerainty of the kings of France over all their temporal domain.\n\nViviers was often troubled by religious conflicts: the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the thirteenth century; the revolt of the [[Calvinists]] against [[Louis XIII]] (1627\u20131629), which ended in the capture of Privas by the royal army; the [[Dragonnades]] under [[Louis XIV]] after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]; the [[war of the Camisards]].\n\nIt was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, and united to the [[See of Mende]]. Re-established in 1822, the diocese then included almost all the ancient Diocese of Viviers and some part of the ancient [[Diocese of Valence]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Puy-en-Velay|Le Puy]] and [[Uz\u00e8s]] (see [[N\u00eemes]]) and was suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Avignon]].\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===To 1000===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Januarius\n* Septimius\n* Maspicianus\n* [[Melanius I of Viviers|Melanius I]]\n* c. 407\u2013c. 411: Avolus\n* c. 411\u2013c. 431: Auxonius\n* c. 452\u2013c. 463: Eulalius\n* c. 486\u2013c. 500: Lucianus\n* c. 507: Valerius\n* c. 517\u2013c. 537: [[Venant de Viviers|Venantius]]<ref>Bishop Venantius is claimed as a son of Sigismund the son of Gondebaud, King of Burgundy (Roche, p. 37), at least by hagiographic sources; historical sources do not mention him in that context.

Erected in the 4th century, the diocese was restored in the Concordat of 1822, and comprises the department of [[Ard\u00e8che]], in the [[Region]] of [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. Currently the diocese is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|Archdiocese of Lyon]]. Its current bishop is Jean-Louis Marie Balsa, appointed in 2015.\n\n==History==\nSaint [[And\u00e9ol]], disciple of Saint [[Polycarp]], evangelized the Vivarais under Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] and was martyred in 208.\n\nThe \"Old Charter\", drawn up in 950 by Bishop Thomas,<ref>Duchesne, pp. 235-237.</ref> the most complete document concerning the primitive Church of Viviers, mentions five bishops who lived at [[Alba Augusta]] (modern Alba-la-Romaine): [[Januarius of Viviers|Januarius]], [[Saint Septimus]], [[Saint Maspicianus]], Saint [[Melanius I of Viviers|Melanius]] and [[Saint Avolus]]. The last was a victim of the invasion of the barbarian [[Chrocus]] (the exact date of which is unknown).\n\nIn consequence of the ravages suffered by Alba Augusta, the new bishop, Saint [[Auxonius]], transferred the see to Viviers about 430. Promotus was probably the first Bishop of Viviers; the document also mentions later several canonized bishops: Saints Lucian and Valerius (fifth and sixth centuries); Saint [[Venantius Fortunatus|Venantius]], disciple of Saint [[Avitus of Vienne|Avitus]], who was present at the councils held in 517 and 535; Saint [[Melanius II of Viviers|Melanius II]] (sixth century); Saint [[Eucherius of Lyon|Eucherius]], Saint [[Fermin|Firminus]], [[Saint Aulus]], Saint Eumachius, Saint Longinus (seventh century); [[Arcontius of Viviers|St. Arcontius]], martyr (date unknown, perhaps later than the ninth century.\n\nIt seems that the Diocese of Viviers was disputed for a long time by the metropolitan Sees of [[Vienne]] and [[Arles]]. From the eleventh century its dependence on Vienne was not contested. John II, cardinal and Bishop of Viviers (1073\u20131095), had the abbatial church of [[Cruas]] consecrated by [[Urban II]] and accompanied him to the [[Council of Clermont]].\n\nAfterwards, it is said that [[Conrad III]] gave Lower Vivaraisas an independent suzerainty to Bishop William (1147). In the thirteenth century, under the reign of [[St. Louis of France]], the Bishop of Viviers was obliged to recognize the jurisdiction of the Seneschal of [[Beucaire]]. By the treaty of 10 July 1305 [[Philip IV of France]] obliged the bishops of Viviers to admit the suzerainty of the kings of France over all their temporal domain.\n\nViviers was often troubled by religious conflicts: the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the thirteenth century; the revolt of the [[Calvinists]] against [[Louis XIII]] (1627\u20131629), which ended in the capture of Privas by the royal army; the [[Dragonnades]] under [[Louis XIV]] after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]; the [[war of the Camisards]].\n\nIt was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, and united to the [[See of Mende]]. Re-established in 1822, the diocese then included almost all the ancient Diocese of Viviers and some part of the ancient [[Diocese of Valence]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Puy-en-Velay|Le Puy]] and [[Uz\u00e8s]] (see [[N\u00eemes]]) and was suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Avignon]].\n\n==Bishops==\n\n===To 1000===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Januarius\n* Septimius\n* Maspicianus\n* [[Melanius I of Viviers|Melanius I]]\n* c. 407\u2013c. 411: Avolus\n* c. 411\u2013c. 431: Auxonius\n* c. 452\u2013c. 463: Eulalius\n* c. 486\u2013c. 500: Lucianus\n* c. 507: Valerius\n* c. 517\u2013c. 537: [[Venant de Viviers|Venantius]]<ref>Bishop Venantius is claimed as a son of Sigismund the son of Gondebaud, King of Burgundy (Roche, p. 37), at least by hagiographic sources; historical sources do not mention him in that context.

The SimpleITK image analysis library is available in multiple programming languages including [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]]<ref>R. Beare, B. C. Lowekamp, Z. Yaniv, \u201cImage Segmentation, Registration and Characterization in R with SimpleITK\u201d, J Stat Softw, 86(8), 2018, doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i08.</ref>, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Tcl]]. Binary distributions are available for all three major operating systems ([[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]). \n\nDeveloped at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as an open resource, its primary goal is to make the algorithms available in the ITK library accessible to the broadest range of scientists whose work includes [[image analysis]], irrespective of their software development skills<ref>B. C. Lowekamp, D. T. Chen, L. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, D. Blezek, \"The Design of SimpleITK\", Front. Neuroinform.,7:45, 2013, doi:10.3389/fninf.2013.00045.</ref>. \nAs a consequence, the SimpleITK interface exposes only the most commonly modified algorithmic settings of the ITK components. Additionally, the library provides both an [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] and a [[Procedural programming|procedural]] interface to most of the image processing filters. The latter enables image analysis workflows with concise syntax. A secondary goal of the library is to promote [[Reproducibility#Reproducible_research|reproducible]] image analysis workflows<ref>Z. Yaniv, B. C. Lowekamp, H.J. Johnson, R. Beare, \"SimpleITK Image-Analysis Notebooks: a Collaborative Environment for Education and Reproducible Research\", J Digit Imaging.,  31(3):290-303, 2018, doi: 10.1007/s10278-017-0037-8.</ref> by using the SimpleITK library in conjunction with modern tools for reproducible computational workflows available in the Python ([[IPython|Jupyter notebooks]]) and R ([[Knitr|knitr package]] ) programming languages. \n\nSoftware development is centered on [[GitHub]] using a [[fork and pull model]]. The project is built using the [[CMake]] tool, with nightly builds posted to the [https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=SimpleITK project's quality dashboard].\n\nMultiple medical image analysis applications and libraries incorporate SimpleITK as a key building block, as it provides a wide range of image filtering and image IO components with a user friendly interface.

The first major release of the toolkit was [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/nlm_releases_simpleitk.html announced in April-May 2017].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2019, SimpleITK development was primarily carried out as part of the intramural research program of the National Library of Medicine with collaborators at The University of Iowa and Monash University. Since 2019, SimpleITK development is primarily carried out under the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology at the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]. In April 2020 the toolkit changed its logo to a more modern design.\n\n==Examples==\n\n=== Gaussian smoothing ===\nShort Python scripts illustrating image reading, blurring, and writing.

The SimpleITK image analysis library is available in multiple programming languages including [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]]<ref>R. Beare, B. C. Lowekamp, Z. Yaniv, \u201cImage Segmentation, Registration and Characterization in R with SimpleITK\u201d, J Stat Softw, 86(8), 2018, doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i08.</ref>, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Tcl]]. Binary distributions are available for all three major operating systems ([[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]). \n\nDeveloped at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as an open resource, its primary goal is to make the algorithms available in the ITK library accessible to the broadest range of scientists whose work includes [[image analysis]], irrespective of their software development skills<ref>B. C. Lowekamp, D. T. Chen, L. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, D. Blezek, \"The Design of SimpleITK\", Front. Neuroinform.,7:45, 2013, doi:10.3389/fninf.2013.00045.</ref>. \nAs a consequence, the SimpleITK interface exposes only the most commonly modified algorithmic settings of the ITK components. Additionally, the library provides both an [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] and a [[Procedural programming|procedural]] interface to most of the image processing filters. The latter enables image analysis workflows with concise syntax. A secondary goal of the library is to promote [[Reproducibility#Reproducible_research|reproducible]] image analysis workflows<ref>Z. Yaniv, B. C. Lowekamp, H.J. Johnson, R. Beare, \"SimpleITK Image-Analysis Notebooks: a Collaborative Environment for Education and Reproducible Research\", J Digit Imaging.,  31(3):290-303, 2018, doi: 10.1007/s10278-017-0037-8.</ref> by using the SimpleITK library in conjunction with modern tools for reproducible computational workflows available in the Python ([[IPython|Jupyter notebooks]]) and R ([[Knitr|knitr package]] ) programming languages. \n\nSoftware development is centered on [[GitHub]] using a [[fork and pull model]]. The project is built using the [[CMake]] tool, with nightly builds posted to the [https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=SimpleITK project's quality dashboard].\n\nMultiple medical image analysis applications and libraries incorporate SimpleITK as a key building block, as it provides a wide range of image filtering and image IO components with a user friendly interface.

The first major release of the toolkit was [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/nlm_releases_simpleitk.html announced in April-May 2017].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2019, SimpleITK development was primarily carried out as part of the intramural research program of the National Library of Medicine with collaborators at The University of Iowa and Monash University. Since 2019, SimpleITK development is primarily carried out under the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology at the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n=== Gaussian smoothing ===\nShort Python scripts illustrating image reading, blurring, and writing.

The effects of [[Long-term memory|long-term]] knowledge on memory\u2019s trace reconstruction have been shown for both visual and [[auditory]] presentation and [[Recall (memory)|recall]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The mechanism of redintegration is still not fully understood and is being actively researched.\n\n== Models of Redintegration ==\n\n=== Multinomial Processing Tree ===\nSchweickert (1993) attempted to model memory redintegration using a multinomial processing tree.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schweickert|first=Richard|date=1993-03|title=A multinomial processing tree model for degradation and redintegration in immediate recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03202729|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=21|issue=2|pages=168\u2013175|doi=10.3758/bf03202729|issn=0090-502X}}</ref> In a multinomial processing tree, the cognitive processes and their outcomes are represented with branches and nodes, respectively. The outcome of the cognitive effort is dependent on which terminal node is reached<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nIn Schweickert model of recall, the trace of memory can be either intact or partially degraded. If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated. If the memory has partially degraded, the item must be reconstructed through trace redintegration. If the process of redintegration was successful, the memory is recalled correctly.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThus, the probability of correct recall (<math>P_C</math>) is:<math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I)</math>Where: <blockquote><math id=\"where\">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact.\n\n<math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration.</blockquote>If the trace is neither intact nor successfully completely redintegrated, person fails to accurately recall the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Trace Redintegration ====\nSchweickert proposed that the redintegration of memory trace happens through two independent processes. In [[lexical]] process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a word. In phonemic process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a string of [[Phenome|phenomes]]. Consequently, the probability of correct redintegration (<math>R</math>), becomes a function of <math id=\"where \">L</math> (lexical process) and/or <math>P</math> (phonemic process). These processes are autonomous, and their effect on <math>R</math> depends on whether they take place sequentially or non-sequentially.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSchweickert\u2019s explanation of trace redintegration is analogous to the processes hypothesized to be responsible for repairs of [[Speech error|errors in speech]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Roodenrys|first=Steven|last2=Miller|first2=Leonie M.|date=2008-04|title=A constrained Rasch model of trace redintegration in serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.36.3.578|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=36|issue=3|pages=578\u2013587|doi=10.3758/mc.36.3.578|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nThough Schweickert indicates that the process of trace redintegration may be facilitated by the context of the situation in which recall takes place (e.g. [[syntax]], [[semantics]]), his model does not provide details on the potential influences of such factors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Extensions ====\n\n\nSchweickert\u2019s model was extended by Gathercole and colleagues (1999), who added a concept of degraded trace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gathercole|first=Susan|last2=Frankish|first2=Clive|last3=Pickering|first3=Susan|last4=Peaker|first4=Sarah|date=1999-02-01|title=Phonotactic Influences on Short-Term Memory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338998_Phonotactic_Influences_on_Short-Term_Memory|journal=Journal of experimental psychology. Learning, memory, and cognition|volume=25|pages=84\u201395|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.1.84}}</ref> Their model of the multinomial processing tree included an additional node, which represents a decayed memory. Such degraded trace can no longer undergo redintegration, and the outcome of recall is incorrect.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, the probability of correct recall (<math>P_C</math>) changes to:       <math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I-T)</math>Where:<blockquote><math id=\"where \">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact.\n\n<math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration. \n\n<math id=\"where \">T</math> is the probability of trace being entirely lost. </blockquote>\n\n==== Criticism ====\nMain criticism of Schweickert model concerns its discrete nature<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. The model treats memory in a binomial manner, where trace can be either intact, leading to correct recall, or partially decayed, with subsequent successful or unsuccessful redintegration. It does not provide an explanation for the factors underlying the trace intactness and does not account for the differences in the numbers of incorrect recall attempts made for the different items. <ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, the model does not incorporate the concept of the degree of memory degradation, implying that the level of trace\u2019s decay does not affect the probability of redintegration.<ref name=\":2\" /> This issue was approached by Roodenrys and Miller (2008), whose alternative account of redintegration uses [[Rasch model]] to demonstrate the continuous process of trace degradation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Influencing Factors ==\n\n=== Lexicality ===\nIn immediate recall, trace reconstruction is more accurate for [[Word|words]] than for non-words<ref name=\":0\" />. This has been labelled as the lexicality effect. The effect is hypothesized to occur due to the differences in presence and availability of [[phonological]] representations. Contrarily to nonwords, words possess stable [[Mental representation|mental representations]] of the accompanying sounds. Such representation can be retrieved from previous knowledge, facilitating the redintegration of item from the memory trace. Lexicality effect is commonly used to support the importance of [[long-term memory]] in the redintegration processes<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Item Similarity ===\nThe redintegration of memory traces may be affected by both [[Semantic similarity|semantic]] and [[phonological]] similarity of items which are to be recalled.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xiaojian|last2=Schweickert|first2=Richard|last3=Gandour|first3=Jack|date=2000-10|title=The phonological similarity effect in immediate recall: Positions of shared phonemes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03211813|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=28|issue=7|pages=1116\u20131125|doi=10.3758/bf03211813|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nSemantic similarity effect\u00a0refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration for lists containing [[semantically]] homogenous items, than for those with semantically heterogenous items. This has been attributed to the differences in the accessibility of different memories in the [[Long-term memory|long-term store]]. When words are presented in semantically homogenous lists, other items may guide the trace reconstruction, providing a cue for item search. This increases the availability of certain memories and facilitate the redintegration process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContrarily, redintegration has been shown to be hindered for items sharing phonological features. This has been attributed to the \u201ctrace competition\u201d, where errors in redintegration are caused by mistaking the items on the lists. The effect of phonological similarity on redintegration may differ depending on the position of shared [[Phenome|phenomes]]\u00a0within the words.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Word Frequency ===\nWord Frequency Effect refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration processes for the words that are encountered more frequently in the language<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Leonie M.|last2=Roodenrys|first2=Steven|date=2009-09|title=The interaction of word frequency and concreteness in immediate serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.37.6.850|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=37|issue=6|pages=850\u2013865|doi=10.3758/mc.37.6.850|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>. This effect has been attributed to the differences in the availability of items stored in [[Long-term memory|long-term memory.]] Frequently encountered words are hypothesized to be more accessible for subsequent recall, which facilitates the reconstruction of memory redintegration of the partially degraded trace<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n=== Phonotactic Frequency ===\nPhonotactic Frequency Effect refers to the pattern in memory redintegration, in which trace reconstruction is more accurate for items that contain [[phoneme]] combination that is frequently represented in the language<ref name=\":3\" />. Though this effect is similar to the Word Frequency Effect, it can also explain patterns in redintegration of non-word items. \n\n=== Others ===\nOther factors which have been shown to facilitate redintegration include the ease of item [[imageability]]<ref name=\":0\" />, familiarity with the language<ref name=\":0\" />, and word [[concreteness]]<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)]]\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Memory]]\n\n{{cognitive-psych-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Reconstruction of the whole of something, from a part}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n'''Redintegration''' refers to the restoration of the whole of something from a part of it.

The effects of [[Long-term memory|long-term]] knowledge on memory\u2019s trace reconstruction have been shown for both visual and [[auditory]] presentation and [[Recall (memory)|recall]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The mechanism of redintegration is still not fully understood and is being actively researched.\n\n== Models of Redintegration ==\n\n=== Multinomial Processing Tree ===\nSchweickert (1993) attempted to model memory redintegration using a multinomial processing tree.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schweickert|first=Richard|date=1993-03|title=A multinomial processing tree model for degradation and redintegration in immediate recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03202729|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=21|issue=2|pages=168\u2013175|doi=10.3758/bf03202729|issn=0090-502X}}</ref> In a multinomial processing tree, the cognitive processes and their outcomes are represented with branches and nodes, respectively. The outcome of the cognitive effort is dependent on which terminal node is reached<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nIn Schweickert model of recall, the trace of memory can be either intact or partially degraded. If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated. If the memory has partially degraded, the item must be reconstructed through trace redintegration. If the process of redintegration was successful, the memory is recalled correctly.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThus, the probability of correct recall (<math>P_C</math>) is:<math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I)</math>Where: <blockquote><math id=\"where \">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact.\n\n<math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration.</blockquote>If the trace is neither intact nor successfully completely redintegrated, person fails to accurately recall the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Trace Redintegration ====\nSchweickert proposed that the redintegration of memory trace happens through two independent processes. In [[lexical]] process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a word. In phonemic process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a string of [[Phenome|phenomes]]. Consequently, the probability of correct redintegration (<math>R</math>), becomes a function of <math id=\"where \">L</math> (lexical process) and/or <math>P</math> (phonemic process). These processes are autonomous, and their effect on <math>R</math> depends on whether they take place sequentially or non-sequentially.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSchweickert\u2019s explanation of trace redintegration is analogous to the processes hypothesized to be responsible for repairs of [[Speech error|errors in speech]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Roodenrys|first=Steven|last2=Miller|first2=Leonie M.|date=2008-04|title=A constrained Rasch model of trace redintegration in serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.36.3.578|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=36|issue=3|pages=578\u2013587|doi=10.3758/mc.36.3.578|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nThough Schweickert indicates that the process of trace redintegration may be facilitated by the context of the situation in which recall takes place (e.g. [[syntax]], [[semantics]]), his model does not provide details on the potential influences of such factors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Extensions ====\n\n\nSchweickert\u2019s model was extended by Gathercole and colleagues (1999), who added a concept of degraded trace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gathercole|first=Susan|last2=Frankish|first2=Clive|last3=Pickering|first3=Susan|last4=Peaker|first4=Sarah|date=1999-02-01|title=Phonotactic Influences on Short-Term Memory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338998_Phonotactic_Influences_on_Short-Term_Memory|journal=Journal of experimental psychology. Learning, memory, and cognition|volume=25|pages=84\u201395|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.1.84}}</ref> Their model of the multinomial processing tree included an additional node, which represents a decayed memory. Such degraded trace can no longer undergo redintegration, and the outcome of recall is incorrect.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, the probability of correct recall changes to:       <math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I-T)</math>Where:<blockquote><math id=\"where \">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact.\n\n<math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration. \n\n<math id=\"where \">T</math> is the probability of trace being entirely lost. </blockquote>\n\n==== Criticism ====\nMain criticism of Schweickert model concerns its discrete nature<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. The model treats memory in a binomial manner, where trace can be either intact, leading to correct recall, or partially decayed, with subsequent successful or unsuccessful redintegration. It does not provide an explanation for the factors underlying the trace intactness and does not account for the differences in the numbers of incorrect recall attempts made for the different items. <ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, the model does not incorporate the concept of the degree of memory degradation, implying that the level of trace\u2019s decay does not affect the probability of redintegration.<ref name=\":2\" /> This issue was approached by Roodenrys and Miller (2008), whose alternative account of redintegration uses [[Rasch model]] to demonstrate the continuous process of trace degradation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Influencing Factors ==\n\n=== Lexicality ===\nIn immediate recall, trace reconstruction is more accurate for [[Word|words]] than for non-words<ref name=\":0\" />. This has been labelled as the lexicality effect. The effect is hypothesized to occur due to the differences in presence and availability of [[phonological]] representations. Contrarily to nonwords, words possess stable [[Mental representation|mental representations]] of the accompanying sounds. Such representation can be retrieved from previous knowledge, facilitating the redintegration of item from the memory trace. Lexicality effect is commonly used to support the importance of [[long-term memory]] in the redintegration processes<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Item Similarity ===\nThe redintegration of memory traces may be affected by both [[Semantic similarity|semantic]] and [[phonological]] similarity of items which are to be recalled.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Xiaojian|last2=Schweickert|first2=Richard|last3=Gandour|first3=Jack|date=2000-10|title=The phonological similarity effect in immediate recall: Positions of shared phonemes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03211813|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=28|issue=7|pages=1116\u20131125|doi=10.3758/bf03211813|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nSemantic similarity effect\u00a0refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration for lists containing [[semantically]] homogenous items, than for those with semantically heterogenous items. This has been attributed to the differences in the accessibility of different memories in the [[Long-term memory|long-term store]]. When words are presented in semantically homogenous lists, other items may guide the trace reconstruction, providing a cue for item search. This increases the availability of certain memories and facilitate the redintegration process.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContrarily, redintegration has been shown to be hindered for items sharing phonological features. This has been attributed to the \u201ctrace competition\u201d, where errors in redintegration are caused by mistaking the items on the lists. The effect of phonological similarity on redintegration may differ depending on the position of shared [[Phenome|phenomes]]\u00a0within the words.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Word Frequency ===\nWord Frequency Effect refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration processes for the words that are encountered more frequently in the language<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Leonie M.|last2=Roodenrys|first2=Steven|date=2009-09|title=The interaction of word frequency and concreteness in immediate serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.37.6.850|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=37|issue=6|pages=850\u2013865|doi=10.3758/mc.37.6.850|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>. This effect has been attributed to the differences in the availability of items stored in [[Long-term memory|long-term memory.]] Frequently encountered words are hypothesized to be more accessible for subsequent recall, which facilitates the reconstruction of memory redintegration of the partially degraded trace<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n=== Phonotactic Frequency ===\nPhonotactic Frequency Effect refers to the pattern in memory redintegration, in which trace reconstruction is more accurate for items that contain [[phoneme]] combination that is frequently represented in the language<ref name=\":3\" />. Though this effect is similar to the Word Frequency Effect, it can also explain patterns in redintegration of non-word items. \n\n=== Others ===\nOther factors which have been shown to facilitate redintegration include the ease of item [[imageability]]<ref name=\":0\" />, familiarity with the language<ref name=\":0\" />, and word [[concreteness]]<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)]]\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Memory]]\n\n{{cognitive-psych-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Helutek", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redintegration"}
