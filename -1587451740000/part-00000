Consequently, seed beds must be established in the first five days after the seeds have been harvested. The seed beds are kept completely in the shade; the seeds are planted 2&nbsp;cm apart and only lightly covered, as greater coverings inhibit germination.

Productivity may be somewhat higher if optimum requirements are studied and provided. The success of Araz\u00e1 as a widespread crop will depend above all on technological developments that facilitate its acceptance on markets outside the region. Any improvement or selection program will have to involve parameters such as appearance, color, smell, palatability and resistance of the fruit to transportation and storage.<ref name=\"r4\" />\n\n==Pest and fungi==\nThe species suffers heavy attacks from fruit flies, which reduces the normal density of plantings if sophisticated biological control measures are not adopted.<ref name=\"r4\" /> The fruit fly (Anastrepha obliqua), attacks the green as well as mature fruits; the larvae feed on the pulp and they destroy it totally when they are numerous. They often appear simultaneously with the larvae of (Conotrachellus sp.). The larvae of (Atractomerus imigrans) feed on the seed, while the larvae of Conotrachellus feed on the pulp. The weevil (Plectrophoroides impressicolli) feeds on the buds, tender leaves and the flowers. The black bee (Trigona branneri) eats the skin, pulp and sometimes the seed of the fruit as well.
