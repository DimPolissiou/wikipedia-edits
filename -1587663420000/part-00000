There were two types of rights exist in the Brunei administrative system: ''sungai kerajaan'' (government river) and  ''sungai tulin'' (private river). Government control on the river includes the rights to all the minerals mined from the river and the right to interfere if there is any political disturbances around the river. Private ownership of the river functioned like a private inheritance which includes the right collect taxes from the residents living near the river. At that time, Pengiran Abu Bakar and Pengiran Tajudin had the private ownership of the Lawas river. They refused to surrender their private ownerships to BNBC but keen to sell their rights to [[Kingdom of Sarawak]]. When the British Consul at [[Labuan]] decided that BNBC should take over the Lawas river by force, Pengiran Abu Bakar quickly invited [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Rajah Charles Brooke]] from Kingdom of Sarawak to govern the Lawas river. BNBC initially was unhappy with the Brooke involvement in the administration of Lawas river. However, in November 1904, BNBC decided the sell their administrative right to Brooke in view of private owners unwilling to cooperate with BNBC; taking Lawas river by force will only spark more rebellion against BNBC and drain the BNBC cash reserves. On 19 January 1905, an agreement was signed between BNBC and Rajah Charles Brooke which saw the official handover of Lawas river to the Brooke government in exchange of 5000 pounds and several administrative areas around Brunei bay to BNBC. An agreement was later reached with the private owners to sell Lawas river to the Brooke government with reparation of 6,000 dollars per year to the private owners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Habid's Buhigiba |first1=Mohamad Bustamam |last2=Suffian |first2=Mansor |last3=Mohd |first3=bin Shamsuddin |title=Pembentukan daerah Lawas sebagai daerah terakhir bersama kerajaan Sarawak (The formation of Lawas district as the last district in the Sarawak government) |journal=Jabatan Sejarah Universiti Malaya (University of Malaya History Office) |date=2018 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=55-80 |url=https://ejournal.um.edu.my/index.php/SEJARAH/article/download/11356/8320/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024221455/https://ejournal.um.edu.my/index.php/SEJARAH/article/download/11356/8320/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-10-24 |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=Malay}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Demographics==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:SIB Kampung Baru Mission, Lawas.jpg|The [[Borneo Evangelical Mission]] (SIB) church\n</gallery>\n\nLawas is made up of a population comprising [[Lun Bawang]], [[Kedayan]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Brunei Malay]], [[Murut people|Murut]] Tagal and [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]]. The main spoken language is [[Brunei Malay]], [[Kedayan]], [[Lun Bawang language|Lun Bawang]] and [[Hokkien]].\n\n== Economy ==\nAs with Limbang, the town is a busy transit point between Sarawak, [[Sabah]], and [[Brunei]].\nTimber and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy. The highland area known as [[Ba'kelalan|Ba'Kelalan]] has been experimenting with the cultivation of [[apple]]s. In addition, the tourism industry is being developed in Ba'Kelalan. However, these plans have been met with controversy due to the probable effects on several traditional tribal villages. Plans to develop small and middle scale industries in Lawas have been proposed by the state government. \nAt this time much of the land in Lawas, Sundar and Trusan has been transformed from [[Paddy field|padi fields]] into [[oil palm]] plantations. Lawas is also known as the producer of smoked fish called 'Tahai' in local dialect. One of the villages that produces 'Tahai' commercially is Kampung Awat-Awat in the Sundar sub-district.\n\n== Transport ==\n===Road===\nLawas, by virtue of its geographical location, is cut off from the rest of Sarawak's road network. It is however linked by main road to [[Sabah]] and [[Brunei]]'s [[Temburong]] district. There is a good local road network around Lawas district which is relatively free of traffic jams.\n\nTravelling to or from Lawas by road requires undergoing immigration checks. Travelling to the rest of Sarawak requires a passport. Two road [[border checkpoint|border crossings]] are located in Lawas district. \n*'''Mengkalap:''' Located to the west of Lawas town is the Mengkalap border checkpoint for traffic headed to or from [[Brunei]]. The new immigration complex at the border has been completed recently. Previously it was operating temporarily from a shoplot in Trusan Bazaar, 8&nbsp;km from the actual [[Brunei-Malaysia border]]. The name of the Brunei checkpoint is [[Labu, Brunei|Labu]] in [[Temburong]] district located at the border. \n*'''Merapok:''' To the east of Lawas town, this checkpoint is for traffic headed to or from [[Sabah]] (both Sarawak and Sabah have autonomy over immigration matters).

The character made his debut in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening]]'' as a human mage pursued by members of the Templar Order, the military arm of the Chantry, which is the dominant religious organization in the ''Dragon Age'' series. He joins the player character as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He appears again as a companion character in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nAlthough the character is initially depicted in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' to be only concerned about his own personal freedom, by ''Dragon Age II'' he has developed a zealous passion to help other mages who are oppressed by the Chantry. He later reveals to Hawke, the player character of the second game, that he has allowed himself to be possessed by a spirit prior to his relocation to Kirkwall, whose rigid belief in moral absolutes influenced his predominantly lighthearted and carefree disposition. Anders later orchestrates the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry; with his actions, the Circles of Magi across Thedas began to rebel against the Templar Order and the Chantry, leading to all-out conflict across the regions of Thedas which later led to the Mage-Templar War in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''.\n\nAnders' depiction in ''Dragon Age II'' has proven divisive among [[video game journalists]] and fans. Some found merit and nuance in his changed personality and antagonism against the templars, while others have disapproved of his darker characterization and suggested that his fanaticism lacked depth. His overt flirtation with Hawke, specifically a male player character, generated controversy as well as substantial discussion on the issue of [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT themes in the ''Dragon Age'' series]].\n\n==Character Overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"What they hadn\u2019t reckoned with by the time of 2011\u2019s ''Dragon Age II'' is that, historically, when you repress a minority, you give them resolve. Often that repression will turn to oppression because of paranoia or sadism. When that happens, that resolve that\u2019s been burning away will often literally explode (see: Anders\u2019 master \u2018plan\u2019). Living things are built with a prime directive: Survive. It\u2019s a powerful instinct, and when it\u2019s all that\u2019s left, a creature a quarter of its assailant\u2019s size will fight to the death.\"\n| source = \u2014Cam Shea, \"A Question of People Born As Walking Bombs\"<ref name=\"Bomb\"/>\n}}\n\nAnders is a wise-cracking human apostate mage who has escaped the Circle of Magi multiple times, only to be captured and brought back by the templars.<ref name=\"World\"/> Born and raised in Ferelden, his father was originally from the Anderfels, a kingdom in northwestern Thedas. He was brought to the Circle of Magi at Ferelden's Kinloch Hold after his magical powers manifested when he turned twelve. Anders initially refused to speak when he arrived there, not even to tell other apprentices his name. They began calling him \"the Ander\", referring to his Anders heritage; \"Anders\" would become the only name he'd use for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"World\"/> Having known friends, a loving family, and a life free of constant supervision during his childhood, the young mage was keenly aware of what he'd lost and constantly rebelled against the Circle's rules and restrictions, and eventually the very structure of the Circle itself.<ref name=\"World\"/> In ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is depicted as very compassionate and eager to help the downtrodden, and he detests Kirkwall's Templar Order for their treatment of the local mages. Anders has an affinity for [[cat]]s, and kept a stray kitten he found in the Vigil's Keep whom he named \"Ser Pounce-a-lot\".\n\nAnders is a potential romance option for Hawke of either gender, whom he will usually develop feelings for even if the player do not flirt with him first.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Unlike other companions in ''Dragon Age II'',<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Anders is noted for being aggressive and proactive in his romantic pursuit for Hawke, who may respond by allowing or firmly rejecting any further flirtation.<ref name=\"Game Love\"/><ref name=\"Women\"/> Rejecting his advances will yield rivalry points, which may be interpreted by some players as a measurable consequence on the avatar-NPC relationship,<ref name=\"Women\"/> even though high rivalry scores unlock bonuses that can't be obtained through a friendship path and inspire companion loyalty just as effectively as high friendship scores.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Jessica Hylton, author of the essay ''LGBTQIA Inclusion in Dragon Age: Inquisition: Burning Down Stereotypes and Modding for Represention'', identified Anders as the most notable example of a character providing gendered responses in the ''Dragon Age'' series. In ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', Anders presents himself as heterosexual.<ref name=\"Girl\"/> If Hawke is male, Anders will reveal that he and Karl were once lovers; if Hawke is female, Anders will omit any mention of his romantic past with Karl. Hylton interprets this as Bioware's attempt to allow players to \"use Anders' bisexuality to include LGBTQIA content or to eliminate it from their gameplay entirely\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nJennifer Hepler, the writer for Anders in ''Dragon Age II'', had intentionally written the character to be a polarizing figure, who would be deeply loved by some players and righteously despised by others. She drew inspiration from the \"cursed romance\" between [[Buffy Summers]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' when writing the romance subplot for Anders and Hawke, noting that it was something Bioware had not done up until ''Dragon Age II''.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\nAnders is voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and by [[Adam Howden]] in ''Dragon Age II''. Howden used his regular speaking voice for the role, with a slight \"[[angst]]y\" inflection.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He did his voice recordings with Caroline Livingstone as the voice director.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/> In preparation for the role, Howden also listened to Ellis' performance from ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and he recognized that they both have a similar vocal quality.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Noting that Anders had evolved from the previous installment where he was more carefree and easygoing, Howden explained that he went his own way with the character, as he \"is written quite differently. He maintains a sense of humor but you learn so much more about him in DA2 and you see a much darker side to him.\"<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/>\n\nMatt Rhodes, who is employed at Bioware as Art Director, uploaded unused concept art he completed during the development cycle of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' on his personal website, which depicts a disheveled Anders living in a cave as a hermit.<ref name=\"Tellurion\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\nAnders is first encountered in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' fending off darkspawn on his own when the Warden-Commander arrives in the midst of an assault on Vigil's Keep, with several templars lying dead around him; Anders denies his culpability in the templars' demise.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> He revealed that he was in the midst of being taken back to the Ferelden Circle when darkspawn attacked Vigil's Keep, but offers to help repel the darkspawn attack. At the conclusion of the siege, the Warden-Commander has the option of conscripting him into the Grey Wardens in order to save him from the templars, who has accused him of murder. During this time he met Justice, a spirit from the metaphysical realm known as the Fade, who is stranded in the decomposing body of a dead Warden named Kristoff. The spirit struggled to understand the real world and its inhabitants, leading him to engage Anders in some in-depth discussions about the world's problems, and eventually about the plight of mages throughout Thedas. For his personal quest, he asks the Warden-Commander to help him find his phylactery, which allows the templars to trace his whereabouts, and destroy it.\n\n''Dragon Age II'' reveals that Anders becomes a Grey Warden and survives the events of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' regardless of the player's choices, but he deserted from the order soon after the ending of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''. He also agreed to host Justice as his new vessel, transferring the spirit from Kristoff's corpse into his own body, and relocated to the city of Kirwall in order to help mages fight for freedom from the Chantry.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Hawke first meets Anders after Varric directs them to seek out a Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. He is found at his clinic in Kirkwall's Darktown giving aid to refugees, healing them free of charge. He convinces Hawke to help rescue his friend Karl from the templars in return for maps of the Deep Roads, but finds that he has been rendered Tranquil, effectively a form of lobotomy which renders the victim unable to feel any emotions. It is then revealed that the spirit of Justice now manifests itself as a spirit of Vengeance, an unintentional side effect of Anders' anger and hatred towards the templars.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> As a result, Anders struggles to maintain control of his own body and mind, and is eventually driven to become a terrorist in the name of mage rights.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/> During the climax of Act III, Anders destroys the Kirkwall Chantry, killing the Grand Cleric and several others.<ref name=\"Six\"/> This in turn gives Knight Commander Meredith the opportunity to invoke the Rite of Annulment, an order to kill all the mages in the Kirkwall Circle, without official sanction from a Grand Cleric or the Divine. Her action sparked the Kirkwall Rebellion. Hawke has the option of executing Anders for his crime, banishing him, or ordering him to fight and make amends. Each companion will react to how Hawke chooses to deal with Anders' fate in their own way, positive or negative.<ref name=\"Six\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAnders is a divisive character.<ref name=\"GameCrate\"/><ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> Writing for ''Kotaku'', Hayley Williams placed the character last on her 2015 list which ranked 51 companions from the ''Mass Effect'' and ''Dragon Age'' games. She complained that his \"terrible characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' was only made worse by the fact that he was genuinely likable and interesting in his first appearance in ''Awakening''\", and insisted that there was no resemblance between the two iterations of the Anders character \"aside from his odd feathery shoulders\".<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> John Walker from ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' contrasted the character's different characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' from his original appearance as \"the formerly fantastically grumpy character from ''Awakenings''\", claiming \"they emasculated him to become such a weedy drip\".<ref name=\"RPS Analysis\"/> On the other hand, Kris Ligman from ''Pop Matters'' opined that ''Dragon Age II'' delivered \"some of the strongest character-driven storytelling that we've seen out of a Bioware title\" in spite of its limitations, noting that she would accept \"poorer production values as a more than acceptable trade off\" if she gets characters \"even half as dynamic as Anders\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> Ligman noted that Anders \"makes multiple references to the freeness of sexuality that he was used to in his youth, but in pursuing a romance with him, the player becomes keenly aware how closely the game's writing is in linking the gift of magical powers and sexuality\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> ''PC Gamer's'' Chris Thursten empathized with Anders, appreciating the moments when his sense of humor \"surfaces above the broody spirit of vengeance that inhabits him\"; by contrast, \"the final, tragic, explosive expression of his frustration at the treatment of mages\" is considered a highlight by Thursten of Hawke's decade-long exploration of relationships with their companions in Kirkwall.<ref name=\"Reinstall\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote = \"The whole situation bothered me not because of what happened but because I condoned it. I was staring at Dragon Age\u2019s universe\u2019s equivalent of [[Osama bin Laden]], and I could have killed him. There\u2019s a point where he puts himself under my sword, but instead, I helped his cause out. To be quite frank, I didn\u2019t see Anders as a terrorist, I saw him as a liberator.\" \n| source = \u2014 Gieson Cacho, \"Terrorism and Dragon Age II\"<ref name=\"Mercury\"/>\n}}\n\nGieson Cacho, in a 2011 post for ''[[Mercury News]]'s'' arts and entertainment blog, was of the view that Anders is the most fascinating aspect of ''Dragon Age II'' with regards to \"how he sets up the conflict that\u2019s central to the game\". Cacho drew a comparison to [[Quentin Tarantino]]\u2019s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', drawing attention to the similarity between both works where the narrative \"turns the table on our perceptions of moral and immoral acts\" over the notion that \"protagonists can act like terrorists in certain circumstances and be justified\". Cacho concluded that while BioWare's approach is flawed as they glossed over the results of the player's actions if they choose to sympathize with Anders, their attempt is considered brave as they \"broach the subject better than [[Infinity Ward]] did with ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''\".<ref name=\"Mercury\"/> [[Mattie Brice]], writing for ''Pop Matters'', provided an in-depth analysis of Anders blowing up the Chantry and by extension, BioWare's statement on contemporary social issues. Brice observed that Anders' actions intertwines anger and sympathy \"in an uncomfortable knot\", and that \"general reception of his actions has been negative\". She suggests that a gut reaction shared by most players would be to \"reprimand Anders in some way, that pushing against violent oppressors is okay -- until you get violent yourself\". To compare him to a contemporary social minority, Brice suggested, would lend \"a perspective that complicates our thinking of both Anders and social change\". Brice concluded that what the game really compels the player to consider is whether \"blowing up the Chantry is what\u2019s necessary for the oppression to end\", and that it is \"a testament to the social relevance that games can have by its blurring of the players\u2019 sense of right and wrong and by its translation of that new understanding into actual activism for issues that exist in reality\".<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nHylton suggested that BioWare attempted to overcompensate for the perceived discomfort with male-male romance in ''Origins'' by having Anders not only pursuing the player character aggressively, but also offering different versions of Anders' past relationship with Karl depending on the player character's gender. Evaluating that the relationship between Anders and Karl is not conditional but the revelation of its nature is  contingent on the player character being female, Hylton called this approach \"a strange way to hide homosexuality\".<ref name=\"Women\"/> Heather Alexandra, writing for ''Kotaku'', notes that there is a clear parallel between real world queer experiences and the narrative of ''Dragon Age II'', which illustrates how mainstream society of Thedas treats individuals born with magical talent, which led to Anders' path to violent revolution. Alexandra stressed that \"it speaks volumes that Anders\u2019 struggle, which borrows heavily from real world queer suffering to pack its emotional punch, requires that his gay lover die \u2014 perhaps even by Anders\u2019 own hand\".<ref name=\"Happy\"/>\n\nSome sources compared Anders to [[Alistair (Dragon Age)|Alistair]], noting a resemblance in physical appearance and personality traits between both characters.<ref name=\"Ode\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/52839/Dragon-Age-Origins-Awakening-Screenshots |title=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening Screenshots |author=Andrew Burnes |date=February 3, 2010 |work=[[VE3D]] |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208020820/http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/52839/Dragon-Age-Origins-Awakening-Screenshots |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-awakening-review |title=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening Review |author=Thierry Nguyen |date=March 16, 2010 |work=1UP.com |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723151341/http://www.1up.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-awakening-review |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Natania Barron of ''Wired'' commented that she \"settled\" for Anders and most likely chose him as her character's romance option for ''Dragon Age II'' because he reminded her of Alistair on a superficial level.<ref name=\"Ode\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2011/04/an-ode-to-alistair-love-lust-and-loss-in-fereldan/ |title=An Ode to Alistair: Love, Lust, and Loss in Fereldan |author=Natania Barron |date=April 15, 2011 |work=Wired |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Red Carpet News TV'' at the London Comic Con MCM Expo in October 2012, Howden noted that Anders was the role he was most recognized for at the time, and that he was the most frequent character fans would ask him to make an impression of when meeting him in person.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2012\"/><ref name=\"Red\"/>\n\n===Controversy=== \nSome players have made open objections towards Anders' unsolicited expression of romantic interest in a male player character. In early 2011, shortly after the release of ''Dragon Age II'', one player made a forum post on Bioware's then-active social forums expressing their distaste for unwanted homosexual advances. One player made a forum post about how he felt Bioware \"neglected their main demographic: The Straight Male Gamer.\" The post, which is now inaccessible after EA shut down Bioware's forums, criticized the game's diversity in romances, and asked for a much bigger focus on straight male gamers as well as an option to remove [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108722-Dragon-Age-2-Lead-Writer-Blasts-Homophobic-Fan|title=Dragon Age 2 Lead Writer Blasts Homophobic Fan|author=Logan Westbrook|date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=[[Escapist Magazine]]|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Gaider responded to the forum post by saying the game is designed for everyone, ending his note with saying that \"the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least.\"<ref name=\"Bisexuality\"/> Other notable examples include a [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' comic strip]] which lampoons Anders' alleged seduction of an unaware Hawke, and an open petition from a self-described gay player which called for Gaider's dismissal from Bioware over what they perceived to be negative representations of openly gay individuals.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/><ref name=\"Queerty\"/>\n\nGreg Armstrong-Morris from [[Daily Xtra|Xtra]] was annoyed by what he perceived to be overreaction by some gamers due to their inability to cope with Anders' flirting, and sarcastically proposed that a [[Kinsey scale]] which allows players to determine their in-game avatars' sexual orientation should be introduced to keep everyone happy.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Ligman quoted Denis Farr from his article written for the GayGamer website to conclude her article \"Take Your Damn Rivalry Points Like a Man: The Non-Dialectic of ''Dragon Age II''\", which read, \"Anders does not call you a \"whore,\" \"slut,\" or any other colorful epithets women in our society can expect from turning down an advance.

The character made his debut in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening]]'' as a human mage pursued by members of the Templar Order, the military arm of the Chantry, which is the dominant religious organization in the ''Dragon Age'' series. He joins the player character as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He appears again as a companion character in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nAlthough the character is initially depicted in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' to be only concerned about his own personal freedom, by ''Dragon Age II'' he has developed a zealous passion to help other mages who are oppressed by the Chantry. He later reveals to Hawke, the player character of the second game, that he has allowed himself to be possessed by a spirit prior to his relocation to Kirkwall, whose rigid belief in moral absolutes influenced his predominantly lighthearted and carefree disposition. Anders later orchestrates the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry; with his actions, the Circles of Magi across Thedas began to rebel against the Templar Order and the Chantry, leading to all-out conflict across the regions of Thedas which later led to the Mage-Templar War in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''.\n\nAnders' depiction in ''Dragon Age II'' has proven divisive among [[video game journalists]] and fans. Some found merit and nuance in his changed personality and antagonism against the templars, while others have disapproved of his darker characterization and suggested that his fanaticism lacked depth. His overt flirtation with Hawke, specifically a male player character, generated controversy as well as substantial discussion on the issue of [[LGBT themes in video games|LGBT themes in the ''Dragon Age'' series]].\n\n==Character Overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"What they hadn\u2019t reckoned with by the time of 2011\u2019s ''Dragon Age II'' is that, historically, when you repress a minority, you give them resolve. Often that repression will turn to oppression because of paranoia or sadism. When that happens, that resolve that\u2019s been burning away will often literally explode (see: Anders\u2019 master \u2018plan\u2019). Living things are built with a prime directive: Survive. It\u2019s a powerful instinct, and when it\u2019s all that\u2019s left, a creature a quarter of its assailant\u2019s size will fight to the death.\"\n| source = \u2014Cam Shea, \"A Question of People Born As Walking Bombs\"<ref name=\"Bomb\"/>\n}}\n\nAnders is a wise-cracking human apostate mage who has escaped the Circle of Magi multiple times, only to be captured and brought back by the templars.<ref name=\"World\"/> Born and raised in Ferelden, his father was originally from the Anderfels, a kingdom in northwestern Thedas. He was brought to the Circle of Magi at Ferelden's Kinloch Hold after his magical powers manifested when he turned twelve. Anders initially refused to speak when he arrived there, not even to tell other apprentices his name. They began calling him \"the Ander\", referring to his Anders heritage; \"Anders\" would become the only name he'd use for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"World\"/> Having known friends, a loving family, and a life free of constant supervision during his childhood, the young mage was keenly aware of what he'd lost and constantly rebelled against the Circle's rules and restrictions, and eventually the very structure of the Circle itself.<ref name=\"World\"/> In ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is depicted as very compassionate and eager to help the downtrodden, and he detests Kirkwall's Templar Order for their treatment of the local mages. Anders has an affinity for [[cat]]s, and kept a stray kitten he found in the Vigil's Keep whom he named \"Ser Pounce-a-lot\".\n\nAnders is a potential romance option for Hawke of either gender, whom he will usually develop feelings for even if the player do not flirt with him first.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Unlike other companions in ''Dragon Age II'',<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Anders is noted for being aggressive and proactive in his romantic pursuit for Hawke, who may respond by allowing or firmly rejecting any further flirtation.<ref name=\"Game Love\"/><ref name=\"Women\"/> Rejecting his advances will yield rivalry points, which may be interpreted by some players as a measurable consequence on the avatar-NPC relationship,<ref name=\"Women\"/> even though high rivalry scores unlock bonuses that can't be obtained through a friendship path and inspire companion loyalty just as effectively as high friendship scores.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Jessica Hylton, author of the essay ''LGBTQIA Inclusion in Dragon Age: Inquisition: Burning Down Stereotypes and Modding for Represention'', identified Anders as the most notable example of a character providing gendered responses in the ''Dragon Age'' series. In ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', Anders presents himself as heterosexual.<ref name=\"Girl\"/> If Hawke is male, Anders will reveal that he and Karl were once lovers; if Hawke is female, Anders will omit any mention of his romantic past with Karl. Hylton interprets this as Bioware's attempt to allow players to \"use Anders' bisexuality to include LGBTQIA content or to eliminate it from their gameplay entirely\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nJennifer Hepler, the writer for Anders in ''Dragon Age II'', had intentionally written the character to be a polarizing figure, who would be deeply loved by some players and righteously despised by others. She drew inspiration from the \"cursed romance\" between [[Buffy Summers]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' when writing the romance subplot for Anders and Hawke, noting that it was something Bioware had not done up until ''Dragon Age II''.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\nAnders is voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and by [[Adam Howden]] in ''Dragon Age II''. Howden used his regular speaking voice for the role, with a slight \"[[angst]]y\" inflection.<ref name=\"Red\"/> He did his voice recordings with Caroline Livingstone as the voice director.<ref name=\"Spotlight\"/> In preparation for the role, Howden also listened to Ellis' performance from ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'', and he recognized that they both have a similar vocal quality.<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/> Noting that Anders had evolved from the previous installment where he was more carefree and easygoing, Howden explained that he went his own way with the character, as he \"is written quite differently. He maintains a sense of humor but you learn so much more about him in DA2 and you see a much darker side to him.\"<ref name=\"RPGSite\"/>\n\nMatt Rhodes, who is employed at Bioware as Art Director, uploaded unused concept art he completed during the development cycle of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' on his personal website, which depicts a disheveled Anders living in a cave as a hermit.<ref name=\"Tellurion\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\nAnders is first encountered in ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' fending off darkspawn on his own when the Warden-Commander arrives in the midst of an assault on Vigil's Keep, with several templars lying dead around him; Anders denies his culpability in the templars' demise.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> He revealed that he was in the midst of being taken back to the Ferelden Circle when darkspawn attacked Vigil's Keep, but offers to help repel the darkspawn attack. At the conclusion of the siege, the Warden-Commander has the option of conscripting him into the Grey Wardens in order to save him from the templars, who has accused him of murder. During this time he met Justice, a spirit from the metaphysical realm known as the Fade, who is stranded in the decomposing body of a dead Warden named Kristoff. The spirit struggled to understand the real world and its inhabitants, leading him to engage Anders in some in-depth discussions about the world's problems, and eventually about the plight of mages throughout Thedas. For his personal quest, he asks the Warden-Commander to help him find his phylactery, which allows the templars to trace his whereabouts, and destroy it.\n\n''Dragon Age II'' reveals that Anders becomes a Grey Warden and survives the events of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening'' regardless of the player's choices, but he deserted from the order soon after the ending of ''Origins \u2013 Awakening''. He also agreed to host Justice as his new vessel, transferring the spirit from Kristoff's corpse into his own body, and relocated to the city of Kirwall in order to help mages fight for freedom from the Chantry.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> Hawke first meets Anders after Varric directs them to seek out a Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. He is found at his clinic in Kirkwall's Darktown giving aid to refugees, healing them free of charge. He convinces Hawke to help rescue his friend Karl from the templars in return for maps of the Deep Roads, but finds that he has been rendered Tranquil, effectively a form of lobotomy which renders the victim unable to feel any emotions. It is then revealed that the spirit of Justice now manifests itself as a spirit of Vengeance, an unintentional side effect of Anders' anger and hatred towards the templars.<ref name=\"Mage\"/> As a result, Anders struggles to maintain control of his own body and mind, and is eventually driven to become a terrorist in the name of mage rights.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/> During the climax of Act III, Anders destroys the Kirkwall Chantry, killing the Grand Cleric and several others.<ref name=\"Six\"/> This in turn gives Knight Commander Meredith the opportunity to invoke the Rite of Annulment, an order to kill all the mages in the Kirkwall Circle, without official sanction from a Grand Cleric or the Divine. Her action sparked the Kirkwall Rebellion. Hawke has the option of executing Anders for his crime, banishing him, or ordering him to fight and make amends. Each companion will react to how Hawke chooses to deal with Anders' fate in their own way, positive or negative.<ref name=\"Six\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAnders is a divisive character.<ref name=\"GameCrate\"/><ref name=\"TheGamer\"/> Writing for ''Kotaku'', Hayley Williams placed the character last on her 2015 list which ranked 51 companions from the ''Mass Effect'' and ''Dragon Age'' games. She complained that his \"terrible characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' was only made worse by the fact that he was genuinely likable and interesting in his first appearance in ''Awakening''\", and insisted that there was no resemblance between the two iterations of the Anders character \"aside from his odd feathery shoulders\".<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> John Walker from ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' contrasted the character's different characterization in ''Dragon Age II'' from his original appearance as \"the formerly fantastically grumpy character from ''Awakenings''\", claiming \"they emasculated him to become such a weedy drip\".<ref name=\"RPS Analysis\"/> On the other hand, Kris Ligman from ''Pop Matters'' opined that ''Dragon Age II'' delivered \"some of the strongest character-driven storytelling that we've seen out of a Bioware title\" in spite of its limitations, noting that she would accept \"poorer production values as a more than acceptable trade off\" if she gets characters \"even half as dynamic as Anders\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> Ligman noted that Anders \"makes multiple references to the freeness of sexuality that he was used to in his youth, but in pursuing a romance with him, the player becomes keenly aware how closely the game's writing is in linking the gift of magical powers and sexuality\".<ref name=\"Quality\"/> ''PC Gamer's'' Chris Thursten empathized with Anders, appreciating the moments when his sense of humor \"surfaces above the broody spirit of vengeance that inhabits him\"; by contrast, \"the final, tragic, explosive expression of his frustration at the treatment of mages\" is considered a highlight by Thursten of Hawke's decade-long exploration of relationships with their companions in Kirkwall.<ref name=\"Reinstall\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote = \"The whole situation bothered me not because of what happened but because I condoned it. I was staring at Dragon Age\u2019s universe\u2019s equivalent of [[Osama bin Laden]], and I could have killed him. There\u2019s a point where he puts himself under my sword, but instead, I helped his cause out. To be quite frank, I didn\u2019t see Anders as a terrorist, I saw him as a liberator.\" \n| source = \u2014 Gieson Cacho, \"Terrorism and Dragon Age II\"<ref name=\"Mercury\"/>\n}}\n\nGieson Cacho, in a 2011 post for ''[[Mercury News]]'s'' arts and entertainment blog, was of the view that Anders is the most fascinating aspect of ''Dragon Age II'' with regards to \"how he sets up the conflict that\u2019s central to the game\". Cacho drew a comparison to [[Quentin Tarantino]]\u2019s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', drawing attention to the similarity between both works where the narrative \"turns the table on our perceptions of moral and immoral acts\" over the notion that \"protagonists can act like terrorists in certain circumstances and be justified\". Cacho concluded that while BioWare's approach is flawed as they glossed over the results of the player's actions if they choose to sympathize with Anders, their attempt is considered brave as they \"broach the subject better than [[Infinity Ward]] did with ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''\".<ref name=\"Mercury\"/> [[Mattie Brice]], writing for ''Pop Matters'', provided an in-depth analysis of Anders blowing up the Chantry and by extension, BioWare's statement on contemporary social issues. Brice observed that Anders' actions intertwines anger and sympathy \"in an uncomfortable knot\", and that \"general reception of his actions has been negative\". She suggests that a gut reaction shared by most players would be to \"reprimand Anders in some way, that pushing against violent oppressors is okay -- until you get violent yourself\". To compare him to a contemporary social minority, Brice suggested, would lend \"a perspective that complicates our thinking of both Anders and social change\". Brice concluded that what the game really compels the player to consider is whether \"blowing up the Chantry is what\u2019s necessary for the oppression to end\", and that it is \"a testament to the social relevance that games can have by its blurring of the players\u2019 sense of right and wrong and by its translation of that new understanding into actual activism for issues that exist in reality\".<ref name=\"How\"/>\n\nHylton suggested that BioWare attempted to overcompensate for the perceived discomfort with male-male romance in ''Origins'' by having Anders not only pursuing the player character aggressively, but also offering different versions of Anders' past relationship with Karl depending on the player character's gender. Evaluating that the relationship between Anders and Karl is not conditional but the revelation of its nature is  contingent on the player character being female, Hylton called this approach \"a strange way to hide homosexuality\".<ref name=\"Women\"/> Heather Alexandra, writing for ''Kotaku'', notes that there is a clear parallel between real world queer experiences and the narrative of ''Dragon Age II'', which illustrates how mainstream society of Thedas treats individuals born with magical talent, which led to Anders' path to violent revolution. Alexandra stressed that \"it speaks volumes that Anders\u2019 struggle, which borrows heavily from real world queer suffering to pack its emotional punch, requires that his gay lover die \u2014 perhaps even by Anders\u2019 own hand\".<ref name=\"Happy\"/>\n\nSome sources compared Anders to [[Alistair (Dragon Age)|Alistair]], noting a resemblance in physical appearance and personality traits between both characters.<ref name=\"Ode\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/52839/Dragon-Age-Origins-Awakening-Screenshots |title=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening Screenshots |author=Andrew Burnes |date=February 3, 2010 |work=[[VE3D]] |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208020820/http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/52839/Dragon-Age-Origins-Awakening-Screenshots |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-awakening-review |title=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening Review |author=Thierry Nguyen |date=March 16, 2010 |work=1UP.com |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723151341/http://www.1up.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-awakening-review |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Natania Barron of ''Wired'' commented that she \"settled\" for Anders and most likely chose him as her character's romance option for ''Dragon Age II'' because he reminded her of Alistair on a superficial level.<ref name=\"Ode\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2011/04/an-ode-to-alistair-love-lust-and-loss-in-fereldan/ |title=An Ode to Alistair: Love, Lust, and Loss in Fereldan |author=Natania Barron |date=April 15, 2011 |work=Wired |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring an interview with ''Red Carpet News TV'' at the London Comic Con MCM Expo in October 2012, Howden noted that Anders was the role he was most recognized for at the time, and that he was the most frequent character fans would ask him to make an impression of when meeting him in person.<ref name=\"MCMBuzz2012\"/><ref name=\"Red\"/>\n\n===Controversy=== \nSome players have made open objections towards Anders' unsolicited expression of romantic interest in a male player character. In early 2011, shortly after the release of ''Dragon Age II'', one player made a forum post on Bioware's then-active social forums expressing their distaste for unwanted homosexual advances. One player made a forum post about how he felt Bioware \"neglected their main demographic: The Straight Male Gamer.\" The post, which is now inaccessible after EA shut down Bioware's forums, criticized the game's diversity in romances, and asked for a much bigger focus on straight male gamers as well as an option to remove [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content.<ref name=\"Escapist\">{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108722-Dragon-Age-2-Lead-Writer-Blasts-Homophobic-Fan|title=Dragon Age 2 Lead Writer Blasts Homophobic Fan|author=Logan Westbrook|date=March 24, 2011 |publisher=[[Escapist Magazine]]|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Gaider responded to the forum post by saying the game is designed for everyone, ending his note with saying that \"the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least.\"<ref name=\"Bisexuality\"/> Other notable examples include a [[Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic)|''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' comic strip]] which lampoons Anders' alleged seduction of an unaware Hawke, and an open petition from a self-described gay player which called for Gaider's dismissal from Bioware over what they perceived to be negative representations of openly gay individuals.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/><ref name=\"Queerty\"/>\n\nGreg Armstrong-Morris from [[Daily Xtra|Xtra]] was annoyed by what he perceived to be overreaction by some gamers due to their inability to cope with Anders' flirting, and sarcastically proposed that a [[Kinsey scale]] which allows players to determine their in-game avatars' sexual orientation should be introduced to keep everyone happy.<ref name=\"Xtra\"/> Ligman quoted Denis Farr from his article written for the GayGamer website to conclude her article \"Take Your Damn Rivalry Points Like a Man: The Non-Dialectic of ''Dragon Age II''\", which read, \"Anders does not call you a \"whore,\" \"slut,\" or any other colorful epithets women in our society can expect from turning down an advance. Even rivals in the game respect Hawke\".<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Conversely, Hylton stated that as a result of the writers' approach towards male to male flirtation in ''Dragon Age II'', Anders is an example of a \"problematic bisexual character\" and that the game's presentation \"inadvertently played into the [[LGBT stereotypes#Pedophilia and predation|predatory gay trope]]\".<ref name=\"Women\"/>\n\nReflecting on her writing work for Anders in her autobiography, Hepler expressed bemusement that some players objected more fervently to Anders proactively flirting with a male player character compared to him \"murdering a nun in order to start a religious war\", noting that the character \"has probably succeeded in being the most controversial character in BioWare history\" from her perspective.<ref name=\"Hepler\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Girl\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening |developer=BioWare |level=City of Amaranthine |quote='''Anders''': All I want is a pretty girl, a decent meal, and the right to shoot lightning at fools.}}</ref>\n\n<!--Printed media-->\n<ref name=\"Game Love\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=M9IdBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=dragon+age+2+homophobic&source=bl&ots=S6TGDYD11e&sig=ACfU3U1ZSIEcKXpt6u7cEiWYSBqZiqwzBA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHrpyhspDoAhVZILcAHWHKASYQ6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=L-word&f=false|title=Game Love: Essays on Play and Affection |editor1=Jessica Enevold |editor2=Esther MacCallum-Stewart|date=January 9, 2015|publisher=CRC Press |isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hepler\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=fyGVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=jennifer+hepler&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLhuaP6Y_oAhXYTX0KHQ0hAE4Q6AEITzAE#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title= Women in Game Development: Breaking the Glass Level-Cap|editor= Jennifer Brandes Hepler|date=April 24, 2019 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=97810-0000-777-0|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Women\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=39nKDwAAQBAJ&dq=anders+flirt+controversy&q=anders#v=onepage&q=anders&f=false|title=Women and Video Game Modding: Essays on Gender and the Digital Community |editor1=Bridget Whelan |editor2=Matthew Wilhelm Kapell|date=January 24, 2020|publisher=McFarland |isbn=97814-7661-878-4|accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"World\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Dragon Age: The World of Thedas |volume=2 |location=[[Milwaukie, Oregon]] |publisher=[[Dark Horse Books]] |date=May 2015|isbn=978-161655-501-6}}</ref>\n\n<!--Web sources-->\n<ref name=\"Bisexuality\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/25/dragon-age-writer-on-characters-bisexuality/|title=Dragon Age Writer On Characters' Bisexuality|author=John Walker |date=March 25, 2011 |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=March 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bomb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/21/a-question-of-people-born-as-walking-bombs|title=A Question of People Born As Walking Bombs|author=Cam Shea |date=December 22, 2014 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GameCrate\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/definitive-ranking-dragon-age-and-mass-effect-companions-second-opinion/10972|author= Lucy K.

{"title_page": "Giffen good", "text_new": "{{Blacklisted-links|1=\n*http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP14.html#Bk.III,Ch.VI\n*:''Triggered by <code>\\beconlib\\.org\\b</code> on the local blacklist''|bot=Cyberbot II|invisible=true}}\n{{Distinguish|Veblen goods}}\nIn [[economics]] and [[consumer theory]], a '''Giffen good''' is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa\u2014violating the basic [[law of demand]] in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, as the [[price]] of the [[Good (economics)|good]] rises, the [[Consumer theory#Substitution effect|substitution effect]] makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of [[substitute good]]s; for most goods, the [[income effect]] (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an [[inferior good]] in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it. A Giffen good is considered to be the opposite of an [[ordinary good]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Types of goods.svg|thumb|420px|right|Types of goods in economics]]\nGiffen goods are named after Scottish economist [[Robert Giffen|Sir Robert Giffen]], to whom [[Alfred Marshall]] attributed this idea in his book ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'', published in 1890. Giffen first proposed the [[paradox]] from his observations of the purchasing habits of the [[Victorian era]] poor.\n\nIt has been suggested by Etsusuke Masuda and Peter Newman that Simon Gray described \"Gray goods\" in his 1815 text entitled ''The Happiness of States: Or An Inquiry Concerning Population, The Modes of Subsisting and Employing It, and the Effects of All on Human Happiness''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2232507| jstor = 2232507| title = Gray and Giffen Goods| journal = The Economic Journal| volume = 91| issue = 364| pages = 1011| year = 1981| last1 = Masuda | first1 = E. | last2 = Newman | first2 = P. }}</ref> The chapter entitled ''A Rise in the Price of Bread Corn, beyond a certain Pitch, tends to increase the Consumption of it,'' contains a detailed account of what have come to be called Giffen goods, and which might better be called Gray goods.\n\n==Analysis==\nFor almost all products, the demand curve has a negative slope: as the price increases, demand for the good decreases.  (See [[Supply and demand]] for background.) Giffen goods are an exception to this general rule. Unlike other goods or services, the price point at which supply and demand meet results in higher prices and greater demand whenever market forces recognize a change in supply and demand for Giffen goods. As a result, when price goes up, the quantity demanded also goes up. To be a true Giffen good, the good's price must be the only thing that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded. A Giffen good should not be confused with products bought as status symbols or for [[conspicuous consumption]] ([[Veblen goods]]), although there may be some overlap as consumers are more likely to engage in conspicuous consumption as a way to engage in \"aspirational spending\" as a way to increase their social status.\n\nThe classic example given by Marshall is of inferior quality [[staple food]]s, whose demand is driven by [[poverty]] that makes their purchasers unable to afford superior foodstuffs. As the price of the cheap staple rises, they can no longer afford to supplement their diet with better foods, and must consume more of the staple food.\n\n{{quote|As Mr. Giffen has pointed out, a rise in the price of bread makes so large a drain on the resources of the poorer labouring families and raises the marginal utility of money to them so much that they are forced to curtail their consumption of meat and the more expensive farinaceous foods: and, bread being still the cheapest food which they can get and will take, they consume more, and not less of it.|Alfred Marshall|''Principles of Economics'' (1895 ed.)<ref>{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1895 |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP14.html#Bk.III,Ch.VI |title=Principles of Economics |volume=Vol. III  |at= Ch. VI, Para. III.VI.17}}</ref>}}\n\nThere are three necessary preconditions for this situation to arise:{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n# the good in question must be an [[inferior good]],\n# there must be a lack of close [[substitute good]]s, and\n# the goods must constitute a substantial percentage of the buyer's income, but not such a substantial percentage of the buyer's income that none of the associated [[normal goods]] are consumed.\n\nIf precondition #1 is changed to \"The goods in question must be so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect\" then this list defines necessary and sufficient conditions. The last condition is a condition on the buyer rather than the goods itself, and thus the phenomenon is also called a \"Giffen behavior\".\n\nThis can be illustrated with a diagram. Initially the consumer has the choice between spending their income on either commodity Y or commodity X as defined by line segment MN (where M = total available income divided by the price of commodity Y, and N = total available income divided by the price of commodity X). The line MN is known as the consumer's budget constraint. Given the consumer's preferences, as expressed in the [[indifference curve]] I<sub>0</sub>, the optimum mix of purchases for this individual is point A.\n\nA price drop for commodity X causes two effects. The reduced price alters [[relative price]]s in favour of commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This is illustrated by the shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from X<sub>a</sub> to X<sub>b</sub> while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from X<sub>b</sub> to X<sub>c</sub>.

One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods is that Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations. Complicating the matter are the requirements for limited availability of substitutes, as well as that the consumers are not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term ''Giffen paradox'' rather than ''Giffen good.''\n\nSome types of premium goods (such as expensive French wines, or celebrity-endorsed perfumes) are sometimes called Giffen goods\u2014via the claim that lowering the price of these high status goods decreases demand because they are no longer perceived as exclusive or high status products. However, to the extent that the perceived nature of such high status goods actually changes significantly with a substantial price drop, this behavior disqualifies them from being considered Giffen goods, because the Giffen goods analysis assumes that only the consumer's income or the relative price level changes, not the nature of the good itself. If a price change modifies consumers' perception of the good, they should be analysed as [[Veblen good]]s. Some economists{{Who|date=January 2012}} question the empirical validity of the distinction between Giffen and Veblen goods, arguing that whenever there is a substantial change in the price of a good its perceived nature also changes, since price is a large part of what constitutes a [[product (business)|product]]. {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence.|date=January 2012}} However the theoretical distinction between the two types of analysis remains clear, which one should apply to any actual case is an empirical matter.\n\n===Great Famine in Ireland===\nPotatoes during the Irish [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] were once considered to be an example of a Giffen good.

For any other sort of good, as the [[price]] of the [[Good (economics)|good]] rises, the [[Consumer theory#Substitution effect|substitution effect]] makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of [[substitute good]]s; for most goods, the [[income effect]] (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an [[inferior good]] in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it. A Giffen good is considered to be the opposite of an ordinary good.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Types of goods.svg|thumb|420px|right|Types of goods in economics]]\nGiffen goods are named after Scottish economist [[Robert Giffen|Sir Robert Giffen]], to whom [[Alfred Marshall]] attributed this idea in his book ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'', published in 1890. Giffen first proposed the [[paradox]] from his observations of the purchasing habits of the [[Victorian era]] poor.\n\nIt has been suggested by Etsusuke Masuda and Peter Newman that Simon Gray described \"Gray goods\" in his 1815 text entitled ''The Happiness of States: Or An Inquiry Concerning Population, The Modes of Subsisting and Employing It, and the Effects of All on Human Happiness''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2232507| jstor = 2232507| title = Gray and Giffen Goods| journal = The Economic Journal| volume = 91| issue = 364| pages = 1011| year = 1981| last1 = Masuda | first1 = E. | last2 = Newman | first2 = P. }}</ref> The chapter entitled ''A Rise in the Price of Bread Corn, beyond a certain Pitch, tends to increase the Consumption of it,'' contains a detailed account of what have come to be called Giffen goods, and which might better be called Gray goods.\n\n==Analysis==\nFor almost all products, the demand curve has a negative slope: as the price increases, demand for the good decreases.  (See [[Supply and demand]] for background.) Giffen goods are an exception to this general rule. Unlike other goods or services, the price point at which supply and demand meet results in higher prices and greater demand whenever market forces recognize a change in supply and demand for Giffen goods. As a result, when price goes up, the quantity demanded also goes up. To be a true Giffen good, the good's price must be the only thing that changes to produce a change in quantity demanded. A Giffen good should not be confused with products bought as status symbols or for [[conspicuous consumption]] ([[Veblen goods]]), although there may be some overlap as consumers are more likely to engage in conspicuous consumption as a way to engage in \"aspirational spending\" as a way to increase their social status.\n\nThe classic example given by Marshall is of inferior quality [[staple food]]s, whose demand is driven by [[poverty]] that makes their purchasers unable to afford superior foodstuffs. As the price of the cheap staple rises, they can no longer afford to supplement their diet with better foods, and must consume more of the staple food.\n\n{{quote|As Mr. Giffen has pointed out, a rise in the price of bread makes so large a drain on the resources of the poorer labouring families and raises the marginal utility of money to them so much that they are forced to curtail their consumption of meat and the more expensive farinaceous foods: and, bread being still the cheapest food which they can get and will take, they consume more, and not less of it.|Alfred Marshall|''Principles of Economics'' (1895 ed.)<ref>{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1895 |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP14.html#Bk.III,Ch.VI |title=Principles of Economics |volume=Vol. III  |at= Ch. VI, Para. III.VI.17}}</ref>}}\n\nThere are three necessary preconditions for this situation to arise:{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n# the good in question must be an [[inferior good]],\n# there must be a lack of close [[substitute good]]s, and\n# the goods must constitute a substantial percentage of the buyer's income, but not such a substantial percentage of the buyer's income that none of the associated [[normal goods]] are consumed.\n\nIf precondition #1 is changed to \"The goods in question must be so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect\" then this list defines necessary and sufficient conditions. The last condition is a condition on the buyer rather than the goods itself, and thus the phenomenon is also called a \"Giffen behavior\".\n\nThis can be illustrated with a diagram. Initially the consumer has the choice between spending their income on either commodity Y or commodity X as defined by line segment MN (where M = total available income divided by the price of commodity Y, and N = total available income divided by the price of commodity X). The line MN is known as the consumer's budget constraint. Given the consumer's preferences, as expressed in the [[indifference curve]] I<sub>0</sub>, the optimum mix of purchases for this individual is point A.\n\nA price drop for commodity X causes two effects. The reduced price alters [[relative price]]s in favour of commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This is illustrated by the shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from X<sub>a</sub> to X<sub>b</sub> while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from X<sub>b</sub> to X<sub>c</sub>. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from X<sub>a</sub> to X<sub>c</sub> making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the substitution effect is a  Giffen good.\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nEvidence for the existence of Giffen goods has generally been limited.
