Nicolosi, who draws on work by previous authors, maintains that the form of conversion therapy he promotes, \"[[Conversion therapy#Reparative therapy|reparative therapy]]\", does not remove all of a person's homosexual feelings, but can help men who do not wish to be homosexual to either become celibate or prepare for heterosexual marriage. He views [[male homosexuality]] as a developmental problem that often results from problems between father and son. The book was first published in the United States by [[Jason Aronson]] in 1991.\n\nThe work, which advocates a therapeutic approach that departs traditional psychoanalytic technique, influenced the practice of conversion therapy. Critics faulted Nicolosi's scholarship, and argued that he provided an inadequate discussion of biological influences on [[sexual orientation]] and incorrectly viewed [[homosexuality]] as pathological; some described conversion therapy as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] opposes reparative therapy and similar treatments aimed at changing a patient's sexual orientation, which are based on theories that conflict with its position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. In 2019, ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' was withdrawn from sale by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] following a campaign by gay rights activists. Some commentators supported Amazon's decision, while others criticized it as a form of [[censorship]]. The book remained available from other booksellers.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Nicolosi writes that Freud viewed homosexuality as pathological.]] \nNicolosi discusses [[conversion therapy]]. He sees his contribution to its development as combining clinical research on the development of male [[gender identity]], histories of family dynamics, and \"the techniques of psychodynamic psychotherapy of male homosexuality\". According to Nicolosi, the form of conversion therapy he advocates, \"reparative therapy\", does not remove all of a person's homosexual feelings, but can \"strengthen masculine identification\" and help men who do not wish to be homosexual to either become celibate or prepare for heterosexual marriage. He states that reparative therapy is partly based on [[object relations theory]], and that its therapeutic goals include clarifying \"the family dynamics that may have led to a man's homosexual condition\" and making \"peace with father\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xiii\u2013xviii}}\n\nMale homosexuality is seen by Nicolosi as \"a developmental problem\" that \"often results from early problems between father and son\". Nicolosi argues that the development of [[heterosexuality]] requires \"the support and cooperation of both parents as the boy disidentifies from mother and identifies with father.\" In his view, problems in the relationship between father and son can result in the latter's \"failure to internalize male gender-identity\". He writes that a boy's failure to fully gender-identify leads to alienation from both the father and from male peers in childhood, resulting in an \"eroticization of maleness\", often associated with \"alienation from the body\" and \"a deficit in sense of personal power\", and that the homosexuality that results represents \"the drive to repair the original gender-identity injury.\" According to Nicolosi, the relevant literature shows that genetic and hormonal factors do not \"seem to play a predetermining role in homosexual development\", but may be predisposing factors for some boys, making them more vulnerable to \"gender-identity injury\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xiii\u2013xviii}} Problems Nicolosi sees as associated with male homosexuality include \"defensive detachment from other males\" and [[sexual promiscuity]]; he argues that without the influence of women, male couples find it difficult to maintain monogamy, and that gay relationships are \"inherently troubled by the limitations of sexual sameness\", and thus are not equivalent to heterosexual relationships.{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xvi\u2013xvii}}\n\nNicolosi also discusses the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], stating that Freud, like the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the psychotherapist [[Alfred Adler]], viewed homosexuality as pathological. He maintains that the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder was the result of politics and the actions of gay rights campaigners rather than new research, and that it has discouraged \"treatment and research\". However, he also sees the change as being partly the result of the psychological professions failure to identify with certainty the psychodynamic causes of homosexuality and its resulting failure to devise a treatment with an acceptable success rate. He suggests that psychoanalytic efforts at treating homosexuality may have failed because they mistakenly focused on homosexual men's assumed fear of females rather than their problems in relating to men; he credits the psychologist [[Elizabeth Moberly]] with correctly recognizing the importance of such \"defensive detachment\", which he sees as the major obstacle to therapeutic success. In agreement with Moberly, he criticizes the emotionally distant therapeutic approach characteristic of psychoanalysis, advocating personal involvement on the part of the therapist to meet the need of male patients for \"intimate male connectedness\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=7\u201311, 18\u201320}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach'' was first published by [[Jason Aronson]] in 1991.{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|page=iv}} The book was republished in 1997.{{sfn|Robinson|Spivey|2007|page=661}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Overview===\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' influenced the practice of conversion therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=Potok|1y=2016|2a1=George|2y=2017|2pp=793\u2013853}} The legal scholar Marie-Am\u00e9lie George called the book \"a standard text for reparative therapists\", noting that it re-popularized ideas that had begun to be discarded following the declassification of homosexuality.{{sfn|George|2017|pages=793\u2013853}} Commentators have noted that the therapeutic approach it advocates departs from traditional psychoanalytic technique.{{sfnm|1a1=Satinover|1y=1996|1pp=183\u2013184|2a1=Drescher|2y=1999|2pp=61\u201380}} The psychiatrist [[Jeffrey Satinover]], who credited Nicolosi with synthesizing and advancing prior research on conversion therapy, argued that these departures are consistent with what Freud predicted would be necessary, and were supported by the experience of many other therapists.{{sfn|Satinover|1996|pages=183\u2013184}}\n\nThe work has been criticized on numerous grounds.{{sfnm|1a1=LeVay|1y=1996|1p=78|2a1=Drescher|2y=1999|2pp=61\u201380|3a1=Bright|3y=2004|3pp=471\u2013481|4a1=Friedman|4y=2006|4pp=115, 118|5a1=''The American Journal of Psychiatry''|5y=2000|5pp=1719\u20131721}} The neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] criticized Nicolosi for viewing homosexuality as pathological.{{sfn|LeVay|1996|page=78}} The psychiatrist [[Jack Drescher]] wrote that Nicolosi valued \"social conformity above the needs of the individual\", a view he criticized as authoritarian. He maintained that Nicolosi favored \"formulaic\" interpretations of his clients.{{sfn|Drescher|1999|pages=61\u201380}} The clinical social worker Chuck Bright compared Nicolosi's views to those of the psychoanalyst [[Charles Socarides]], criticizing both.{{sfn|Bright|2004|pages=471\u2013481}} The psychiatrist [[Richard C. Friedman]] criticized Nicolosi for making generalizations about gay people based on clinical samples.{{sfn|Friedman|2006|pages=115, 118}} In 2000, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], in a statement published in ''[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', reaffirmed its opposition to treatments, including reparative therapy, which assume that a patient should change his or her homosexual orientation, noting that they are based on theories that conflict with the APA's position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. It referred to Nicolosi as a practitioner of reparative therapy who had \"openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality\".{{sfn|''The American Journal of Psychiatry''|2000|pages=1719\u20131721}}\n\n===Reviews===\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' received a positive review from the psychologist I. Reed Payne in ''Issues in Religion and Psychotherapy'',{{sfn|Payne|1993|pages=113\u2013116}} a mixed review from the sex researcher [[James D. Weinrich]] in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',{{sfn|Weinrich|1993|pages=291\u2013295}} and a negative review from Friedman in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.{{sfn|Friedman|1997|pages=225\u2013227}} The book was also reviewed by Kirk-Evan Billet in ''Island Lifestyle Magazine''.{{sfn|Billet|1991|page=31}}\n\nPayne endorsed Nicolosi's view that the idea that homosexuality is innate and unchangeable is mistaken. He believed that the book benefited from Nicolosi's clinical experience and credited him with clearly presenting his views on the diagnosis and treatment of homosexuality, as well as helping to explain its development. However, he noted that critics of Nicolosi's work would object to the limited attention given to biological influences on homosexuality, and that Nicolosi could not answer all the questions his work raised.{{sfn|Payne|1993|pages=113\u2013116}}\n\nWeinrich credited Nicolosi with being the first author of a book offering therapy to homosexual men who wish to change their sexual orientation to admit that such change is not possible. He also credited him with acknowledging that his theory about the cause of male homosexuality is not applicable to all homosexual patients. However, while he considered the idea that \"defensive detachment\" is a cause of homosexuality applicable to some gay men, he criticized Nicolosi for concluding that homosexuality must be pathological if it develops in the way he proposed. He also criticized Nicolosi for failing to discuss how his religious beliefs might have affected his views on homosexuality, providing an inadequate discussion of biological influences on sexual orientation that ignored relevant evidence, and for stereotyping gay men and describing gay relationships only in negative terms. He concluded that Nicolosi's views on homosexuals were based on a biased sample, and questioned the quality of Nicolosi's scholarship as well as his proposals for therapy.{{sfn|Weinrich|1993|pages=291\u2013295}}\n\nFriedman wrote that the book had scholarly limitations. He considered Nicolosi incorrect to claim that the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder had discouraged research. He also faulted his discussion of \"the psychobiology of sexual orientation\" and maintained that his understanding of gay people was \"severely compromised by his personal negative belief system about homosexuality.\" Though he agreed that some mental health professionals had adopted a political stance on homosexuality, he regarded Nicolosi as being equally as biased as the gay rights activists he criticized. He argued that the book's quality was undermined by the fact that Nicolosi was not trained as a psychoanalyst.{{sfn|Friedman|1997|pages=225\u2013227}}\n\n===Withdrawal from sale by Amazon===\nGwen Aviles of [[NBC News]] reported in July 2019 that [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had withdrawn Nicolosi's books, which she described as \"some of the most well-known works about conversion therapy\", from sale following a campaign by gay rights activists.{{sfn|Aviles|2019}} Amazon's decision received criticism from some commentators.{{sfnm|1a1=Dreher|1y=2019|2a1=Nicolosi Jr.|2y=2019|3a1=Knight|3y=2019}} In ''[[The American Conservative]]'', the journalist [[Rod Dreher]] decried it as a step toward censorship. He noted that Amazon continued to sell other books that were controversial or could be considered dangerous or unscientific.{{sfn|Dreher|2019}} In ''[[The Daily Signal]]'', Joseph Nicolosi Jr. defended his father's books, and noted that one man credited ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' with saving his marriage.{{sfn|Nicolosi Jr.|2019}} On [[Townhall]], Robert Knight described Amazon's decision to stop selling Nicolosi's books as a form of censorship.{{sfn|Knight|2019}} Daniel Newhauser of [[Vice News]] reported that a group of Republican members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] were campaigning to reverse Amazon's decision, which they considered a form of censorship.{{sfn|Newhauser|2019}} \n\nHowever, other commentators supported Amazon's decision.{{sfn|Polumbo|2019}}{{sfn|Gander|2019}} Brad Polumbo of the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' observed that Nicolosi's books, as well as books by authors who considered themselves ex-gay, were controversial.

Nicolosi, who draws on work by previous authors, maintains that the form of conversion therapy he promotes, \"[[Conversion therapy#Reparative therapy|reparative therapy]]\", does not remove all of a person's homosexual feelings, but can help men who do not wish to be homosexual to either become celibate or prepare for heterosexual marriage. He views [[male homosexuality]] as a developmental problem that often results from problems between father and son. The book was first published in the United States by [[Jason Aronson]] in 1991.\n\nThe work, which advocates a therapeutic approach that departs traditional psychoanalytic technique, influenced the practice of conversion therapy. Critics faulted Nicolosi's scholarship, and argued that he provided an inadequate discussion of biological influences on [[sexual orientation]] and incorrectly viewed [[homosexuality]] as pathological; some described conversion therapy as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] opposes reparative therapy and similar treatments aimed at changing a patient's sexual orientation, which are based on theories that conflict with its position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. In 2019, ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' was withdrawn from sale by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] following a campaign by gay rights activists. Some commentators supported Amazon's decision, while others criticized it as a form of [[censorship]]. The book remained available from other booksellers.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Nicolosi writes that Freud viewed homosexuality as pathological.]] \nNicolosi discusses [[conversion therapy]]. He sees his contribution to its development as combining clinical research on the development of male [[gender identity]], histories of family dynamics, and \"the techniques of psychodynamic psychotherapy of male homosexuality\". According to Nicolosi, the form of conversion therapy he advocates, \"reparative therapy\", does not remove all of a person's homosexual feelings, but can \"strengthen masculine identification\" and help men who do not wish to be homosexual to either become celibate or prepare for heterosexual marriage. He states that reparative therapy is partly based on [[object relations theory]], and that its therapeutic goals include clarifying \"the family dynamics that may have led to a man's homosexual condition\" and making \"peace with father\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xiii\u2013xviii}}\n\nMale homosexuality is seen by Nicolosi as \"a developmental problem\" that \"often results from early problems between father and son\". Nicolosi argues that the development of [[heterosexuality]] requires \"the support and cooperation of both parents as the boy disidentifies from mother and identifies with father.\" In his view, problems in the relationship between father and son can result in the latter's \"failure to internalize male gender-identity\". He writes that a boy's failure to fully gender-identify leads to alienation from both the father and from male peers in childhood, resulting in an \"eroticization of maleness\", often associated with \"alienation from the body\" and \"a deficit in sense of personal power\", and that the homosexuality that results represents \"the drive to repair the original gender-identity injury.\" According to Nicolosi, the relevant literature shows that genetic and hormonal factors do not \"seem to play a predetermining role in homosexual development\", but may be predisposing factors for some boys, making them more vulnerable to \"gender-identity injury\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xiii\u2013xviii}} Problems Nicolosi sees as associated with male homosexuality include \"defensive detachment from other males\" and [[sexual promiscuity]]; he argues that without the influence of women, male couples find it difficult to maintain monogamy, and that gay relationships are \"inherently troubled by the limitations of sexual sameness\", and thus are not equivalent to heterosexual relationships.{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=xvi\u2013xvii}}\n\nNicolosi also discusses the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], stating that Freud, like the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the psychotherapist [[Alfred Adler]], viewed homosexuality as pathological. He maintains that the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder was the result of politics and the actions of gay rights campaigners rather than new research, and that it has discouraged \"treatment and research\". However, he also sees the change as being partly the result of the psychological professions failure to identify with certainty the psychodynamic causes of homosexuality and its resulting failure to devise a treatment with an acceptable success rate. He suggests that psychoanalytic efforts at treating homosexuality may have failed because they mistakenly focused on homosexual men's assumed fear of females rather than their problems in relating to men; he credits the psychologist [[Elizabeth Moberly]] with correctly recognizing the importance of such \"defensive detachment\", which he sees as the major obstacle to therapeutic success. In agreement with Moberly, he criticizes the emotionally distant therapeutic approach characteristic of psychoanalysis, advocating personal involvement on the part of the therapist to meet the need of male patients for \"intimate male connectedness\".{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|pages=7\u201311, 18\u201320}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality: A New Clinical Approach'' was first published by [[Jason Aronson]] in 1991.{{sfn|Nicolosi|1991|page=iv}} The book was republished in 1997.{{sfn|Robinson|Spivey|2007|page=661}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Overview===\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' influenced the practice of conversion therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=Potok|1y=2016|2a1=George|2y=2017|2pp=793\u2013853}} The legal scholar Marie-Am\u00e9lie George called the book \"a standard text for reparative therapists\", noting that it re-popularized ideas that had begun to be discarded following the declassification of homosexuality.{{sfn|George|2017|pages=793\u2013853}} Commentators have noted that the therapeutic approach it advocates departs from traditional psychoanalytic technique.{{sfnm|1a1=Satinover|1y=1996|1pp=183\u2013184|2a1=Drescher|2y=1999|2pp=61\u201380}} The psychiatrist [[Jeffrey Satinover]], who credited Nicolosi with synthesizing and advancing prior research on conversion therapy, argued that these departures are consistent with what Freud predicted would be necessary, and were supported by the experience of many other therapists.{{sfn|Satinover|1996|pages=183\u2013184}}\n\nThe work has been criticized on numerous grounds.{{sfnm|1a1=LeVay|1y=1996|1p=78|2a1=Drescher|2y=1999|2pp=61\u201380|3a1=Bright|3y=2004|3pp=471\u2013481|4a1=Friedman|4y=2006|4pp=115, 118|5a1=''The American Journal of Psychiatry''|5y=2000|5pp=1719\u20131721}} The neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]] criticized Nicolosi for viewing homosexuality as pathological.{{sfn|LeVay|1996|page=78}} The psychiatrist [[Jack Drescher]] wrote that Nicolosi valued \"social conformity above the needs of the individual\", a view he criticized as authoritarian. He maintained that Nicolosi favored \"formulaic\" interpretations of his clients.{{sfn|Drescher|1999|pages=61\u201380}} The clinical social worker Chuck Bright compared Nicolosi's views to those of the psychoanalyst [[Charles Socarides]], criticizing both.{{sfn|Bright|2004|pages=471\u2013481}} The psychiatrist [[Richard C. Friedman]] criticized Nicolosi for making generalizations about gay people based on clinical samples.{{sfn|Friedman|2006|pages=115, 118}} In 2000, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], in a statement published in ''[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', reaffirmed its opposition to treatments, including reparative therapy, which assume that a patient should change his or her homosexual orientation, noting that they are based on theories that conflict with the APA's position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. It referred to Nicolosi as a practitioner of reparative therapy who had \"openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality\".{{sfn|''The American Journal of Psychiatry''|2000|pages=1719\u20131721}}\n\n===Reviews===\n''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' received a positive review from the psychologist I. Reed Payne in ''Issues in Religion and Psychotherapy'',{{sfn|Payne|1993|pages=113\u2013116}} a mixed review from the sex researcher [[James D. Weinrich]] in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',{{sfn|Weinrich|1993|pages=291\u2013295}} and a negative review from Friedman in the ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]''.{{sfn|Friedman|1997|pages=225\u2013227}} The book was also reviewed by Kirk-Evan Billet in ''Island Lifestyle Magazine''.{{sfn|Billet|1991|page=31}}\n\nPayne endorsed Nicolosi's view that the idea that homosexuality is innate and unchangeable is mistaken. He believed that the book benefited from Nicolosi's clinical experience and credited him with clearly presenting his views on the diagnosis and treatment of homosexuality, as well as helping to explain its development. However, he noted that critics of Nicolosi's work would object to the limited attention given to biological influences on homosexuality, and that Nicolosi could not answer all the questions his work raised.{{sfn|Payne|1993|pages=113\u2013116}}\n\nWeinrich credited Nicolosi with being the first author of a book offering therapy to homosexual men who wish to change their sexual orientation to admit that such change is not possible. He also credited him with acknowledging that his theory about the cause of male homosexuality is not applicable to all homosexual patients. However, while he considered the idea that \"defensive detachment\" is a cause of homosexuality applicable to some gay men, he criticized Nicolosi for concluding that homosexuality must be pathological if it develops in the way he proposed. He also criticized Nicolosi for failing to discuss how his religious beliefs might have affected his views on homosexuality, providing an inadequate discussion of biological influences on sexual orientation that ignored relevant evidence, and for stereotyping gay men and describing gay relationships only in negative terms. He concluded that Nicolosi's views on homosexuals were based on a biased sample, and questioned the quality of Nicolosi's scholarship as well as his proposals for therapy.{{sfn|Weinrich|1993|pages=291\u2013295}}\n\nFriedman wrote that the book had scholarly limitations. He considered Nicolosi incorrect to claim that the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder had discouraged research. He also faulted his discussion of \"the psychobiology of sexual orientation\" and maintained that his understanding of gay people was \"severely compromised by his personal negative belief system about homosexuality.\" Though he agreed that some mental health professionals had adopted a political stance on homosexuality, he regarded Nicolosi as being equally as biased as the gay rights activists he criticized. He argued that the book's quality was undermined by the fact that Nicolosi was not trained as a psychoanalyst.{{sfn|Friedman|1997|pages=225\u2013227}}\n\n===Withdrawal from sale by Amazon===\nGwen Aviles of [[NBC News]] reported in July 2019 that [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had withdrawn Nicolosi's books, which she described as \"some of the most well-known works about conversion therapy\", from sale following a campaign by gay rights activists.{{sfn|Aviles|2019}} Amazon's decision received criticism from some commentators.{{sfnm|1a1=Dreher|1y=2019|2a1=Nicolosi Jr.|2y=2019|3a1=Knight|3y=2019}} In ''[[The American Conservative]]'', the journalist [[Rod Dreher]] decried it as a step toward censorship. He noted that Amazon continued to sell other books that were controversial or could be considered dangerous or unscientific.{{sfn|Dreher|2019}} In ''[[The Daily Signal]]'', Joseph Nicolosi Jr. defended his father's books, and noted that one man credited ''Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality'' with saving his marriage.{{sfn|Nicolosi Jr.|2019}} On [[Townhall]], Robert Knight described Amazon's decision to stop selling Nicolosi's books as a form of censorship.{{sfn|Knight|2019}} Daniel Newhauser of [[Vice News]] reported that a group of Republican members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] were campaigning to reverse Amazon's decision, which they considered a form of censorship.{{sfn|Newhauser|2019}} \n\nHowever, other commentators supported Amazon's decision.{{sfn|Polumbo|2019}}{{sfn|Gander|2019}} Brad Polumbo of the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' observed that Nicolosi's books, as well as books by authors who considered themselves ex-gay, were controversial. While he considered the criticism that Amazon's decision to stop selling them had received understandable, he nevertheless believed the decision correct, describing Nicolosi's work as \"harmful pseudoscience\".

Although these stories are not directly attested, they have been reconstructed by scholars of [[comparative mythology]] based on the similarities in the languages and belief systems of Indo-European peoples.\n\nVarious schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European mythology, which do not always agree with each other.  The main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are [[Vedic mythology|Vedic]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]], often supported with evidence from the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]], [[Armenian mythology|Armenian]], and [[Albanian mythology|Albanian]] traditions as well.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes well-attested deities such as [[Dyeus|*''Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25\u2090t\u1e17r'']], the god of the daylit skies, his consort ''[[Dh\u00e9\u01f5h\u014dm|*D\u02b0\u00e9\u01f5\u02b0\u014dm]]'', the earth mother, his daughter [[Hausos|*''H\u2090\u00e9us\u014ds'']], the goddess of the dawn, the [[divine twins|Divine Twins]], and the storm god [[Perkwunos|*''Perk\u02b7unos'']]. Other probable deities include ''*P\u00e9h\u2082us\u014dn'', a pastoral god, and [[Sol (mythology)|''*Seh\u2082ul'']], a female [[solar deity]].\n\nWell-attested myths of the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth involving a [[storm god]] who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world.

Another reflex may be found in a medieval Irish tradition involving a king-designate from [[County Donegal]] copulating with a [[mare]] before bathing with the parts of the sacrificed animal.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=437}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=24\u201325}} The Indic ritual likewise involves the ritual copulation by the queen with the dead [[stallion]], and if [[Hittite laws]] prohibited copulation with animals, they made an exception of horses or mules.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=24\u201325}} In both the Celtic and Indic traditions, an intoxicating brewage played a part in the ritual, and the [[suffix]] in ''a\u015bva-medh\u00e1'' could be related to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Old Indic]] word ''mad-'' (\"boil, rejoice, get drunk\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=313}} [[Jaan Puhvel]] has also compared the Vedic name of the tradition with the Gaulish god ''Epomeduos'', the \"master of horses\".{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=94}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pinault|first=Georges-Jean|title=Gaulois et celtique continental|publisher=Droz|year=2007|isbn=978-2-600-01337-6|editor-last=Lambert|editor-first=Pierre-Yves|location=Paris|pages=291\u2013307|chapter=Gaulois epomeduos, le ma\u00eetre des chevaux|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VNHHxyNt0C}}</ref>\n\n=== Cults ===\nScholars have reconstructed a Proto-Indo-European cult of the weapons, especially the [[dagger]], which holds a central position in various customs and myths.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=464}}{{Sfn|Littleton|1982|p=}} In the [[Ossetian mythology|Ossetic]] [[Nart saga]], the sword of [[Batraz|Batradz]] is dragged into the sea after his death, and the British [[King Arthur]] throws his legendary sword [[Excalibur]] back into the lake from which it initially came. The Indic [[Arjuna]] is also instructed to throw his bow into the sea at the end of his career, and weapons were frequently thrown into lakes, rivers or bogs as a form of prestige offering in [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age Europe]].{{Sfn|West|2007|p=464}} Reflexes of an ancestral cult of the magical sword have been proposed in the legends of Excalibur and [[Durendal|Durandal]] (the weapon of [[Roland]], said to have been forged by the mythical [[Wayland the Smith]]).

Although these stories are not directly attested, they have been reconstructed by scholars of [[comparative mythology]] based on the similarities in the languages and belief systems of Indo-European peoples.\n\nVarious schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European mythology, which do not always agree with each other.  The main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are [[Vedic mythology|Vedic]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]], often supported with evidence from the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]], [[Armenian mythology|Armenian]], and [[Albanian mythology|Albanian]] traditions as well.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes well-attested deities such as [[Dyeus|*''Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25\u2090t\u1e17r'']], the god of the daylit skies, his consort ''[[Dh\u00e9\u01f5h\u014dm|*D\u02b0\u00e9\u01f5\u02b0\u014dm]]'', the earth mother, his daughter [[Hausos|*''H\u2090\u00e9us\u014ds'']], the goddess of the dawn, the [[divine twins|Divine Twins]], and the storm god [[Perkwunos|*''Perk\u02b7unos'']]. Other probable deities include ''*P\u00e9h\u2082us\u014dn'', a pastoral god, and [[Sol (mythology)|''*Seh\u2082ul'']], a female [[solar deity]].\n\nWell-attested myths of the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth involving a [[storm god]] who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world.

Another reflex may be found in a medieval Irish tradition involving a king-designate from [[County Donegal]] copulating with a [[mare]] before bathing with the parts of the sacrificed animal.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=437}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=24\u201325}} The Indic ritual likewise involves the ritual copulation by the queen with the dead [[stallion]], and if [[Hittite laws]] prohibited copulation with animals, they made an exception of horses or mules.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=24\u201325}} In both the Celtic and Indic traditions, an intoxicating brewage played a part in the ritual, and the [[suffix]] in ''a\u015bva-medh\u00e1'' could be related to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Old Indic]] word ''mad-'' (\"boil, rejoice, get drunk\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=313}} [[Jaan Puhvel]] has also compared the Vedic name of the tradition with the Gaulish god ''Epomeduos'', the \"master of horses\".{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=94}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pinault|first=Georges-Jean|title=Gaulois et celtique continental|publisher=Droz|year=2007|isbn=978-2-600-01337-6|editor-last=Lambert|editor-first=Pierre-Yves|location=Paris|pages=291\u2013307|chapter=Gaulois epomeduos, le ma\u00eetre des chevaux|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0VNHHxyNt0C}}</ref>\n\n=== Cults ===\nScholars have reconstructed a Proto-Indo-European cult of the weapons, especially the [[dagger]], which holds a central position in various customs and myths.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=464}}{{Sfn|Littleton|1982|p=}} In the [[Ossetian mythology|Ossetic]] [[Nart saga]], the sword of [[Batraz|Batradz]] is dragged into the sea after his death, and the British [[King Arthur]] throws his legendary sword [[Excalibur]] back into the lake from which it initially came. The Indic [[Arjuna]] is also instructed to throw his bow into the sea at the end of his career, and weapons were frequently thrown into lakes, rivers or bogs as a form of prestige offering in [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age Europe]].{{Sfn|West|2007|p=464}} Reflexes of an ancestral cult of the magical sword have been proposed in the legends of Excalibur and [[Durendal|Durandal]] (the weapon of [[Roland]], said to have been forged by the mythical [[Wayland the Smith]]). Among North Iranians, [[Herodotus]] described the [[Scythians|Scythian]] practice of worshiping swords as manifestations of \"Ares\" in the 5th century BC, and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] depicted the [[Alans|Alanic]] custom of thrusting swords into the earth and worshiping them as \"Mars\" in the 4th century AD.{{Sfn|Littleton|1982|p=}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mythology}}\n* ''[[Interpretatio graeca]]'', the comparison of Greek deities to Germanic, Roman, and Celtic deities\n* [[Neolithic religion]]\n* [[Proto-Indo-European society]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World |first=David W. |last=Anthony |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOG5VcYxhiEC|isbn=978-1400831104|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Arvidsson|first=Stefan|title=Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=0-226-02860-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idTPDI6l0mkC&vq|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw7KxwEACAAJ|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek|last=Beekes|first=Robert S.
