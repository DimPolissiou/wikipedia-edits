It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nThe special over the years has been panned by the ''Doctor Who Fanbase'' and is no longer considered to be canon in the main continuity.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' the year before. Baker was reluctant to take part as he hated the script and his scenes were re-written by himself at the last minute. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's [[The Day of the Doctor]] in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"'' who may or may not be a future incarnation of the Doctor himself. He will reprise the role in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish Productions']] ''Doctor Who: Stranded'', alongside [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]].\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\". He would later reprise the role again in the 2007 Mini-Episode broadcast for Children In Need [[Time Crash]] alongside his future son-in-law [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]].\n*It is, to date, the final on-screen appearance of [[Colin Baker]] as the [[Sixth Doctor]].  \n*This is the last appearance on television of [[Caroline John]] as [[Liz Shaw]] (John died in 2012) and [[Deborah Watling]] as [[Victoria Waterfield]] (Watling died in 2017).\n*In February 1993, [[Sophie Aldred]] had guest-starred in a two-episode arc on ''EastEnders'' as Suzi.<ref>''EastEnders'' episodes dated 2 February 1993 and 4 February 1993</ref> She appears in ''Dimensions in Time'' as [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]], her character from ''Doctor Who'' and the final [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the classic era.\n*This marked the only time in which [[Nicholas Courtney]] and/or his character, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]], appeared with the [[Sixth Doctor]] on screen; they did also meet in various [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas.\n\n{{Episode table\n   |background =\n   |series = 6 |title = 20 | aux1=6 | airdate = 10 | viewers = 6 | country = UK\n   |seriesT    = Episode\n   |aux1T      = Run time\n   |viewersR   = {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n   |episodes   =\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 1\n   |Title              = Part One\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|26|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.8\n   |Aux1               = 7:34\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  {{Episode list/sublist|Dimensions in Time\n   |EpisodeNumber      = 2\n   |Title              = Part Two\n   |RTitle             =\n   |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1993|11|27|df=y}}\n   |Viewers            = 13.6\n   |Aux1               = 5:27\n   |LineColor          =\n  }}\n  }}\n\n*''The Dimensions of Time'' and ''3-Dimensions of Time'' were the working titles for this story.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} David Roden managed to convince producer John Nathan-Turner not to use either title, and instead settled on ''Dimensions In Time''.\n\nThis was David Roden's first professional script. \nRoden's original draft for a script featured Seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy, meeting the Brigadier, Nicholas Courtney, en route to a UNIT reunion \u2013 and becoming involved in a battle with a crashed spaceship full of Cybermen. The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.\n* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme ''[[Noel's House Party]]''.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Dimensions in Time'' achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of ''Doctor Who'' ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of ''[[City of Death]]'', at 16.1 million viewers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Scripts/DIT/intro.html Doctor Who Scripts Project page for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*{{BBCCDW| id=dimensionstime | title= Dimensions in Time}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622072451/http://www.doctorwhoworld.org.uk/dimensions.htm ''Doctor Who World'' episode guide entry for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*[http://drwhoguide.com/mp3/dimens.mp3 Title music]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/toby-hadoke-s-who-s-round-128---david-roden-1337 Toby Hadoke\u2019s Who\u2019s Round - David Roden] - interview with writer\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n{{First Doctor stories}}\n{{Cybermen stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who crossovers]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who multi-Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who spin-offs]]\n[[Category:EastEnders spin-offs]]\n[[Category:Third Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fourth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fifth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Sixth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who charity episodes]]\n[[Category:Children in Need]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:3D television programs]]\n[[Category:Anniversary television episodes]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n[[Category:Crossover television]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2013]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| serial_name        = Dimensions in Time\n| show               = DW\n| type               = serial / charity crossover with ''[[EastEnders]]''\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| doctors            =\n* [[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n*[[Colin Baker]] ([[Sixth Doctor]])\n*[[Peter Davison]] ([[Fifth Doctor]])\n*[[Tom Baker]] ([[Fourth Doctor]])\n*[[Jon Pertwee]] ([[Third Doctor]])\n| companions         =\n* [[Sophie Aldred]] ([[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]])\n* [[John Leeson]] (Voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]])\n* [[Bonnie Langford]] ([[Melanie Bush]])\n* [[Nicola Bryant]] ([[Peri Brown]])\n* [[Sarah Sutton]] ([[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]])\n* [[Lalla Ward]] ([[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]])\n* [[Louise Jameson]] ([[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]])\n* [[Elisabeth Sladen]] ([[Sarah Jane Smith]])\n* [[Richard Franklin (actor)|Richard Franklin]] ([[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]])\n* [[Caroline John]] ([[Liz Shaw]])\n* [[Nicholas Courtney]] ([[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]])\n* [[Deborah Watling]] ([[Victoria Waterfield]])\n* [[Carole Ann Ford]] ([[Susan Foreman]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Kate O'Mara]] \u2014 [[Rani (Doctor Who)|The Rani]]\n*[[Samuel West]] \u2014 Cyrian\n*[[Deepak Verma]] \u2014 [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay Kapoor]]\n*[[Shobu Kapoor]] \u2014 [[Gita Kapoor]]\n*[[Wendy Richard]] \u2014 [[Pauline Fowler]]\n*[[Gillian Taylforth]] \u2014 [[Kathy Beale]]\n*[[Letitia Dean]] \u2014 [[Sharon Watts]]\n*[[Pam St. Clement]] \u2014 [[Pat Butcher]]\n*[[Nicola Stapleton]] \u2014 [[Mandy Salter]]\n*[[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] \u2014 [[Frank Butcher]]\n*[[Adam Woodyatt]] \u2014 [[Ian Beale]]\n*[[Steve McFadden]] \u2014 [[Phil Mitchell]]\n*[[Ross Kemp]] \u2014 [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]]\n| director           = Stuart McDonald\n| writer             = [[John Nathan-Turner]]<br/>David Roden\n| producer           = John Nathan-Turner\n| composer           = [[Keff McCulloch]]\n| production_code    = C280X<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dimensionstime/detail.shtml |title=BBC - Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Dimensions in Time - Details |accessdate=13 December 2007 |work= }}</ref>\n| length             = 2 episodes, 7 minutes and 5 minutes\n| started            = {{Start date|1993|11|26|df=y}}\n| ended              = {{End date|1993|11|27|df=y}}\n| preceding          = ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]''\n| following          = ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''\n}}\n'''''Dimensions in Time''''' is a charity special [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and the [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' that ran in two parts on 26 and 27 November 1993.

The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate. Roden has been a script editor for the BBC, most recently on ''Casualty'', and on ITV for ''Coronation Street''.\n\n==Broadcast==\n* Part One was broadcast as part of the 1993 [[Children in Need]] [[telethon]]. It was introduced by [[Noel Edmonds]] in a short live sketch with [[Jon Pertwee]], in character as the [[Third Doctor]].\n* At the end of Part One, viewers were asked to phone in and vote for which ''EastEnders'' character would save the Doctor at the start of Part Two. Two versions of the scene were filmed, one featuring [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]] and the other [['Big' Ron]]. The \u00a3101,000 raised from phone calls went to Children in Need. The result of the vote was announced prior to the screening of Part Two. The version featuring Mandy was broadcast after it won 56% of the vote.\n* Part Two was broadcast as part of popular UK programme ''[[Noel's House Party]]''.\n\n==Ratings==\n''Dimensions in Time'' achieved viewing figures of 13.8 million viewers for the first part and 13.6 million for the second part, making them two of the most highly watched episodes of ''Doctor Who'' ever produced. The highest single audience figure was for Part Four of ''[[City of Death]]'', at 16.1 million viewers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Scripts/DIT/intro.html Doctor Who Scripts Project page for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*{{BBCCDW| id=dimensionstime | title= Dimensions in Time}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622072451/http://www.doctorwhoworld.org.uk/dimensions.htm ''Doctor Who World'' episode guide entry for ''Dimensions in Time'']\n*[http://drwhoguide.com/mp3/dimens.mp3 Title music]\n*[http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/toby-hadoke-s-who-s-round-128---david-roden-1337 Toby Hadoke\u2019s Who\u2019s Round - David Roden] - interview with writer\n{{Doctor Who}}\n{{EastEnders}}\n{{Multi-Doctor stories}}\n{{First Doctor stories}}\n{{Cybermen stories}}\n{{UNIT stories}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who crossovers]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who multi-Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who spin-offs]]\n[[Category:EastEnders spin-offs]]\n[[Category:Third Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fourth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Fifth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Sixth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:The Rani (Doctor Who) stories]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who charity episodes]]\n[[Category:Children in Need]]\n[[Category:1993 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:3D television programs]]\n[[Category:Anniversary television episodes]]\n[[Category:British television episodes in multiple parts]]\n[[Category:Crossover television]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2013]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast notes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time"}
