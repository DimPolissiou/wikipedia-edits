The [[Gunpowder empires|Islamic gunpowder empires]] were formally dissolved and European [[imperialism]] brought much of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and almost all of Africa under [[colonial rule]].\n\nIt was marked by the collapse of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Zulu Kingdom]], [[First French Empire|First French]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the [[British Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[United States]], the [[German Empire]] (essentially replacing the Holy Roman Empire), the [[Second French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Meiji Japan]], with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815. After the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], and its [[Tipu Sultan|Indian allies]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British and Russian empires expanded greatly, becoming the world's leading powers. The Russian Empire expanded in the Caucasus, central and far eastern Asia.\n\nThe remaining powers in the [[Indian subcontinent]] such as the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and its [[Franco-Indian alliance|French allies]], [[Nawabs of Bengal]], [[Maratha Empire]], [[Sikh Empire]] and the princely states of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], suffered a massive decline, and their dissatisfaction with British [[East India Company]]'s rule led to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], marking its dissolution, however, it was later ruled directly by the [[British Crown]] through the establishment of the [[British Raj]].\n\nThe British Empire grew rapidly in the first half of the century, especially with the expansion of vast territories in Canada, Australia, South Africa and heavily populated India, and in the last two decades of the century in Africa. By the end of the century, the British Empire controlled a fifth of the world's land and one-quarter of the world's population. During the post-Napoleonic era, it enforced what became known as the [[Pax Britannica]], which had ushered in unprecedented [[globalization]] and economic integration on a massive scale.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Napoleon Bonaparte]].]]\n\nThe first [[electronics]] appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the [[electric relay]] in 1835, the [[telegraph]] and its [[Morse code]] protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_telephone_1.html|title=The First Telephone Call|website=www.americaslibrary.gov|access-date=2015-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022110620/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_telephone_1.html|archive-date=2015-10-22|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first functional [[light bulb]] in 1878.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|title=Dec. 18, 1878: Let There Be Light \u2014 Electric Light|date=18 December 2009|journal=WIRED|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021003405/https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating [[scientific discovery]] and [[invention]], with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105005042/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Great Inventions].

Similarly, [[serfdom]] was abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]] in 1861.\n \nThe 19th century was remarkable in the widespread formation of new [[settler|settlement]] foundations which were particularly prevalent across North America and Australia, with a significant proportion of the two continents' largest cities being founded at some point in the century. [[Chicago]] in the United States and [[Melbourne]] in Australia were non-existent in the earliest decades but grew to become the 2nd largest cities in the United States and British Empire respectively by the end of the century.

The war swings decisively against the French Empire]]\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of major conflicts from 1803 to 1815 pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France in 1799.  In 1804, he crowned himself [[Emperor of the French]].\n\nIn 1805, the French victory over an Austrian-Russian army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] ended the [[War of the Third Coalition]].  As a result of the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved.\n\nLater efforts were less successful.  In the [[Peninsular War]], France unsuccessfully attempted to establish [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as King of Spain. In 1812, the [[French invasion of Russia]] had massive French casualties, and was a turning point in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1814, after defeat in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to [[Elba]].  Later that year, he escaped exile and began the [[Hundred Days]] before finally being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and exiled to [[Saint Helena]], an island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, the [[Congress of Vienna]] was held to determine new national borders.  The [[Concert of Europe]] attempted to preserve this settlement was established to preserve these borders, with limited impact.\n\n===Latin American independence===\n{{main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the Chilean declaration of independence|The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] on 18 February 1818]]\nMost countries in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] obtained independence from [[Colonialism|colonial]] overlords during the 19th century.  In 1804, [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]] gained independence from France.  In [[Mexico]], the [[Mexican War of Independence]] was a decade-long conflict that ended in Mexican independence in 1821.\n\nDue to the Napoleonic Wars, the royal family of Portugal [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|relocated to Brazil]] from 1808-1821, leading to Brazil having a separate monarchy from Portugal.\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Central America]] gained independence from Spain in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823.  After several rebellions, by 1841 the federation had dissolved into the independent countries of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez-Brignoli|first1=Hector|title=A Brief History of Central America|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520909762}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the post-colonial nation of [[Gran Colombia]] dissolved and the nations of [[Colombia]] (including modern-day Panama), [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]] took its place.\n\n===Revolutions of 1848===\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848]] were a series of [[political upheaval]]s throughout [[Europe]] in 1848.  The revolutions were essentially [[democracy|democratic]] and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old [[Monarchy|monarchical]] structures and creating independent nation states.\n\nThe first revolution began in [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|January in Sicily]].{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Revolutions then spread across Europe after a separate revolution began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]]. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries.\n\nAccording to Evans and von Strandmann (2000), some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.<ref>R.J.W.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abolished in 1808, and by the end of the century, almost every government had banned slavery.  The [[Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833 banned slavery throughout the [[British Empire]], and the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.\n\n[[Abolitionism in the United States]] continued until the end of the American Civil War. Among others [[Frederick Douglass]], and [[Harriet Tubman]], were two of many American Abolitionists who helped win the fight against slavery. Douglass was an articulate orator and incisive antislavery writer; while Tubman's efforts was by using a network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\nThe American Civil War took place from 1861-1865.  Eleven [[Southern United States|southern states]] seceded from the [[United States]], largely over concerns related to slavery.

In 1831, the [[Great Bosnian uprising]] against Ottoman rule occurred. In 1817, the [[Principality of Serbia]] became [[suzerain]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and in 1867, it passed a [[Constitution]] which defined its independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].  In 1876, [[Bulgarians]] instigate the [[April Uprising]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.  Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] recognized the formal independence of the [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Romania]].

Its leader, [[Hong Xiuquan]], declared himself the younger brother of [[Jesus Christ]] and developed a new Chinese religion known as the [[God Worshipping Society]].  After proclaiming the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851, the Taiping army conquered a large part of China, capturing [[Nanjing]] in 1853.

Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of [[Charles Darwin]] (alongside the independent researches of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]), who in 1859 published the book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', which introduced the idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the [[germ theory of disease]]. Following this, [[Louis Pasteur]] made the first [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]], and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the [[optical isomerism|asymmetry of crystals]]. In chemistry, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], following the [[atomic theory]] of [[John Dalton]], created the first [[periodic table]] of [[Chemical element|elements]]. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]], [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and their contemporaries led to the creation of [[electromagnetism]] as a new branch of science. [[Thermodynamics]] led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined. Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry \u2013 and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of [[hypercomplex number]]s. [[Karl Weierstrass]] and others carried out the [[arithmetization of analysis]] for functions of [[Function of a real variable|real]] and [[complex variable]]s. It also saw rise to [[Non-Euclidean geometry|new progress in geometry]] beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about: [[Thomas Alva Edison]] gave the world a practical everyday [[lightbulb]]. [[Nikola Tesla]] pioneered the [[induction motor]], high frequency transmission of electricity, and remote control. Other new inventions were electrical telegraphy and the telephone.\n[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Faraday]] (1791\u20131867)]]\n* [[1807]]: [[Potassium]] and [[Sodium]] are individually isolated by [[Sir Humphry Davy]].\n* [[1831]]\u2013[[1836]]: [[Charles Darwin]]'s journey on {{HMS|Beagle}}.\n* [[1859]]: [[Charles Darwin]] publishes ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.\n* [[1861]]: [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes ''[[On Physical Lines of Force]]'', formulating the four [[Maxwell's equations]].\n* [[1865]]: [[Gregor Mendel]] formulates his [[laws of inheritance]].\n* [[1869]]: [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] created the [[Periodic table]].\n* [[1873]]: Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' published.\n* [[1877]]: [[Asaph Hall]] discovers the [[moons of Mars]]\n* [[1896]]: [[Henri Becquerel]] discovers [[radioactivity]]; [[J.

[[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are considered the initiators of the new school in England, while in the continent the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' spreads its influence as far as Italy and Spain.

Italian naturalist novels are especially important in that they give a social map of the new unified Italy to a people that until then had been scarcely aware of its ethnic and cultural diversity. There was a huge literary output during the 19th century.

The [[Gunpowder empires|Islamic gunpowder empires]] were formally dissolved and European [[imperialism]] brought much of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and almost all of Africa under [[colonial rule]].\n\nIt was marked by the collapse of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Zulu Kingdom]], [[First French Empire|First French]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires. This paved the way for the growing influence of the [[British Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[United States]], the [[German Empire]] (essentially replacing the Holy Roman Empire), the [[Second French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Meiji Japan]], with the British boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815. After the defeat of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], and its [[Tipu Sultan|Indian allies]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British and Russian empires expanded greatly, becoming the world's leading powers. The Russian Empire expanded in the Caucasus, central and far eastern Asia.\n\nThe remaining powers in the [[Indian subcontinent]] such as the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and its [[Franco-Indian alliance|French allies]], [[Nawabs of Bengal]], [[Maratha Empire]], [[Sikh Empire]] and the princely states of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], suffered a massive decline, and their dissatisfaction with British [[East India Company]]'s rule led to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], marking its dissolution, however, it was later ruled directly by the [[British Crown]] through the establishment of the [[British Raj]].\n\nThe British Empire grew rapidly in the first half of the century, especially with the expansion of vast territories in Canada, Australia, South Africa and heavily populated India, and in the last two decades of the century in Africa. By the end of the century, the British Empire controlled a fifth of the world's land and one-quarter of the world's population. During the post-Napoleonic era, it enforced what became known as the [[Pax Britannica]], which had ushered in unprecedented [[globalization]] and economic integration on a massive scale.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Napoleon Bonaparte]].]]\n\nThe first [[electronics]] appeared in the 19th century, with the introduction of the [[electric relay]] in 1835, the [[telegraph]] and its [[Morse code]] protocol in 1837, the first telephone call in 1876,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_telephone_1.html|title=The First Telephone Call|website=www.americaslibrary.gov|access-date=2015-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022110620/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/recon/jb_recon_telephone_1.html|archive-date=2015-10-22|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first functional [[light bulb]] in 1878.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|title=Dec. 18, 1878: Let There Be Light \u2014 Electric Light|date=18 December 2009|journal=WIRED|access-date=4 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021003405/https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century was an era of rapidly accelerating [[scientific discovery]] and [[invention]], with significant developments in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, electricity, and metallurgy that laid the groundwork for the technological advances of the 20th century.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105005042/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Great Inventions].

Similarly, [[serfdom]] was abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]] in 1861.\n \nThe 19th century was remarkable in the widespread formation of new [[settler|settlement]] foundations which were particularly prevalent across North America and Australia, with a significant proportion of the two continents' largest cities being founded at some point in the century. [[Chicago]] in the United States and [[Melbourne]] in Australia were non-existent in the earliest decades but grew to become the 2nd largest cities in the United States and British Empire respectively by the end of the century.

The war swings decisively against the French Empire]]\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of major conflicts from 1803 to 1815 pitting the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and its allies, led by [[Napoleon I]], against a fluctuating array of [[Coalition forces of the Napoleonic Wars|European powers formed into various coalitions]], financed and usually led by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the [[French Revolution]] and its [[French Revolutionary Wars|resultant conflict]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] gained power in France in 1799.  In 1804, he crowned himself [[Emperor of the French]].\n\nIn 1805, the French victory over an Austrian-Russian army at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] ended the [[War of the Third Coalition]].  As a result of the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved.\n\nLater efforts were less successful.  In the [[Peninsular War]], France unsuccessfully attempted to establish [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as King of Spain. In 1812, the [[French invasion of Russia]] had massive French casualties, and was a turning point in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1814, after defeat in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to [[Elba]].  Later that year, he escaped exile and began the [[Hundred Days]] before finally being defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and exiled to [[Saint Helena]], an island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat, the [[Congress of Vienna]] was held to determine new national borders.  The [[Concert of Europe]] attempted to preserve this settlement was established to preserve these borders, with limited impact.\n\n===Latin American independence===\n{{main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the Chilean declaration of independence|The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] on 18 February 1818]]\nMost countries in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] obtained independence from [[Colonialism|colonial]] overlords during the 19th century.  In 1804, [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]] gained independence from France.  In [[Mexico]], the [[Mexican War of Independence]] was a decade-long conflict that ended in Mexican independence in 1821.\n\nDue to the Napoleonic Wars, the royal family of Portugal [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|relocated to Brazil]] from 1808-1821, leading to Brazil having a separate monarchy from Portugal.\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Central America]] gained independence from Spain in 1821 and from Mexico in 1823.  After several rebellions, by 1841 the federation had dissolved into the independent countries of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez-Brignoli|first1=Hector|title=A Brief History of Central America|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520909762}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the post-colonial nation of [[Gran Colombia]] dissolved and the nations of [[Colombia]] (including modern-day Panama), [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]] took its place.\n\n===Revolutions of 1848===\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Liberal and nationalist pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848]] were a series of [[political upheaval]]s throughout [[Europe]] in 1848.  The revolutions were essentially [[democracy|democratic]] and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old [[Monarchy|monarchical]] structures and creating independent nation states.\n\nThe first revolution began in [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|January in Sicily]].{{clarify|date=December 2017}} Revolutions then spread across Europe after a separate revolution began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]]. Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries.\n\nAccording to Evans and von Strandmann (2000), some of the major contributing factors were widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership, demands for more participation in government and democracy, demands for freedom of the press, other demands made by the working class, the upsurge of nationalism, and the regrouping of established government forces.<ref>R.J.W.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abolished in 1808, and by the end of the century, almost every government had banned slavery.  The [[Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833 banned slavery throughout the [[British Empire]], and the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.\n\n[[Abolitionism in the United States]] continued until the end of the American Civil War. Among others [[Frederick Douglass]], and [[Harriet Tubman]], were two of many American Abolitionists who helped win the fight against slavery. Douglass was an articulate orator and incisive antislavery writer; while Tubman's efforts was by using a network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the [[Underground Railroad]].\n\nThe American Civil War took place from 1861-1865.  Eleven [[Southern United States|southern states]] seceded from the [[United States]], largely over concerns related to slavery.  In 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Lincoln issued a preliminary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation|title=The Emancipation Proclamation|date=October 6, 2015|website=National Archives|access-date=February 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206210236/https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation|archive-date=February 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> on September 22, 1862 warning that in all states still in rebellion ([[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]) on January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves \"then, thenceforward, and forever free.\"<ref>McPherson, J.

In 1831, the [[Great Bosnian uprising]] against Ottoman rule occurred. In 1817, the [[Principality of Serbia]] became [[suzerain]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and in 1867, it passed a [[Constitution]] which defined its independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].  In 1876, [[Bulgarians]] instigate the [[April Uprising]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.  Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] recognized the formal independence of the [[Principality of Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Romania]]. [[Bulgaria]] becomes autonomous.\n\n=== China: Taiping Rebellion ===\n[[File:Regaining the Provincial Capital of Ruizhou.jpg|thumb|280px|A scene of the [[Taiping Rebellion]].]]\nThe [[Taiping Rebellion]] was the bloodiest conflict of the 19th century, leading to the deaths of 20 million people.  Its leader, [[Hong Xiuquan]], declared himself the younger brother of [[Jesus Christ]] and developed a new Chinese religion known as the [[God Worshipping Society]].  After proclaiming the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851, the Taiping army conquered a large part of China, capturing [[Nanjing]] in 1853. In 1864, after the death of Hong Xiuquan, [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] forces recaptured Nanjing and ended the rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Thomas H.|title=The Taiping heavenly kingdom rebellion and the blasphemy of empire|date=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0295801926|edition=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Japan: Meiji Restoration ===\n{{main|Meiji Restoration}}\nDuring the [[Edo period]], [[History of Japan|Japan]] largely pursued an [[Sakoku|isolationist foreign policy]].  In 1853, United States Navy Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] threatened the Japanese capital [[Edo]] with gunships, demanding that they agree to open trade.  This led to [[Bakumatsu|the opening of trade relations]] between Japan and foreign countries, with the policy of [[Sakoku]] formally ended in 1854.\n\nBy 1872, the Japanese government under [[Emperor Meiji]] had [[Abolition of the han system|eliminated the ''daimy\u014d'' system]] and established a strong central government.  Further reforms included the abolishment of the [[samurai]] class, rapid industrialization and modernization of government, closely following European models.<ref>W. G.

Britain seized control of Egypt to ensure control of the [[Suez Canal]].  France, Belgium, Portugal, and Germany also had substantial colonies. The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885 attempted to reach agreement on colonial borders in Africa, but disputes continued, both amongst European powers and in resistance by the native population.<ref name=\"KerrAfrica\" />\n\nIn 1867, [[diamonds]] were discovered in the [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] region of South Africa.

Among the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of [[Charles Darwin]] (alongside the independent researches of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]), who in 1859 published the book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', which introduced the idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the [[germ theory of disease]]. Following this, [[Louis Pasteur]] made the first [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]], and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the [[optical isomerism|asymmetry of crystals]]. In chemistry, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], following the [[atomic theory]] of [[John Dalton]], created the first [[periodic table]] of [[Chemical element|elements]]. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of [[Michael Faraday]], [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and their contemporaries led to the creation of [[electromagnetism]] as a new branch of science. [[Thermodynamics]] led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined. Other highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry \u2013 and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of [[hypercomplex number]]s. [[Karl Weierstrass]] and others carried out the [[arithmetization of analysis]] for functions of [[Function of a real variable|real]] and [[complex variable]]s. It also saw rise to [[Non-Euclidean geometry|new progress in geometry]] beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about: [[Thomas Alva Edison]] gave the world a practical everyday [[lightbulb]]. [[Nikola Tesla]] pioneered the [[induction motor]], high frequency transmission of electricity, and remote control. Other new inventions were electrical telegraphy and the telephone.\n[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Faraday]] (1791\u20131867)]]\n* [[1807]]: [[Potassium]] and [[Sodium]] are individually isolated by [[Sir Humphry Davy]].\n* [[1831]]\u2013[[1836]]: [[Charles Darwin]]'s journey on {{HMS|Beagle}}.\n* [[1859]]: [[Charles Darwin]] publishes ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.\n* [[1861]]: [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes ''[[On Physical Lines of Force]]'', formulating the four [[Maxwell's equations]].\n* [[1865]]: [[Gregor Mendel]] formulates his [[laws of inheritance]].\n* [[1869]]: [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] created the [[Periodic table]].\n* [[1873]]: Maxwell's ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' published.\n* [[1877]]: [[Asaph Hall]] discovers the [[moons of Mars]]\n* [[1896]]: [[Henri Becquerel]] discovers [[radioactivity]]; [[J.

Smith }}</ref>]]\n\n===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===\n[[File:Gulliver in Liliput, Bremen.jpg|thumb|Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.]]\nThe travel begins with a short preamble in which [[Lemuel Gulliver]] gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.\n\n;4 May 1699&nbsp;\u2013 13 April 1702\n\nDuring his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their subjects.\n\nAt first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.\n\nGulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, \"a considerable person at court\", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.\n\n===Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag===\n[[File:gulliver.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver exhibited to the Brobdingnag Farmer'' (painting by [[Richard Redgrave]])]]\n\n;20 June 1702&nbsp;\u2013 3 June 1706\n\nGulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship ''Adventure'' is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the [[North American]] continent.\n\nThe grass of [[Brobdingnag]] is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72&nbsp;ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being {{convert|10|yd|m|0}}. The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter [[Glumdalclitch]] cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the Queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen's service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his \"travelling box\".\n\nBetween small adventures such as fighting giant [[wasp]]s and being carried to the roof by a [[monkey]], he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England.\n\n===Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan===\n[[File:Laputa - Grandville.jpg|thumb|upright|Gulliver discovers Laputa, the flying island (illustration by [[Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard Grandville|J. J. Grandville]])]]\n\n{{See also|Floating cities and islands in fiction}}\n\n;5 August 1706&nbsp;\u2013 16 April 1710\n\nSetting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by [[Piracy|pirates]], and he is [[Marooning|marooned]] close to a desolate rocky island near [[India]]. He is rescued by the [[Floating island (fiction)|flying island]] of [[Laputa]], a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than use armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.\n\nGulliver tours [[Balnibarbi]], the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the [[Royal Society]] and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of [[Lagado]] in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see [[Muckraker|muckraking]]). Gulliver is then taken to [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]], the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.\n\nWhile waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of [[Glubbdubdrib]] which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the \"ancients versus moderns\" theme in the book. The ghosts consist of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]].\n\nOn the island of [[Luggnagg]], he encounters the ''[[struldbrug]]s'', people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.\n\nAfter reaching [[Japan in Gulliver\u2019s Travels|Japan]], Gulliver asks [[Tenno|the Emperor]] \"to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of [[Fumi-e|trampling upon the crucifix]]\", which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.\n\n===Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms===\n[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninim\u016f - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 illustration by [[J.J. Grandville]]).]]\n\n;7 September 1710&nbsp;\u2013 5 December 1715\n\nDespite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a [[wikt:merchantman|merchantman]], as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew who, he believes, have turned against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of deformed savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]].\n\nGulliver becomes a member of a horse's household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver's \"Master,\" the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.\n\nHe returns to his home in England, but is unable to reconcile himself to living among \"Yahoos\" and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.\n\nIt is now generally accepted that the fourth voyage of ''Gulliver's Travels'' does embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the meaning of his existence in the universe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jan, Firdaus|first=K. M., Shabam|title=Perspectives on Gulliver's Travels|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and history==\nIt is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing ''Gulliver's Travels''. (Much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], whilst Swift stayed there.) Some sources{{which|date=August 2013}} suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, [[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] and others formed the [[Scriblerus Club]] with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the \"travellers' tales\" literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as ''Gulliver's Travels'' was a transparently anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish [[pamphlet]]s (the ''Drapier's Letters''). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher [[Benjamin Motte]], who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.<ref>Clive Probyn, ''Swift, Jonathan (1667\u20131745)'', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: [[Oxford]], 2004)</ref> Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of [[Lindalino]]), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8''s''. ''6''d.''<ref>''Daily Journal'' 28 Oct 1726, \"This day is published\".</ref>\n\nMotte published ''Gulliver's Travels'' anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput''), parodies (''Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...'') and \"keys\" (''Gulliver Decipher'd'' and ''Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd'', the second by [[Edmund Curll]] who had similarly written a \"key\" to Swift's ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735. Swift's friend [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a set of five ''Verses on Gulliver's Travels'', which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included.\n\n===Faulkner's 1735 edition===\nIn 1735 an Irish publisher, [[George Faulkner]], printed a set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was ''Gulliver's Travels''. As revealed in Faulkner's \"Advertisement to the Reader\", Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte's work by \"a friend of the author\" (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte's amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the ''[[Editio Princeps]]'' of ''Gulliver's Travels'' with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, ''A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson'', which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that \"I do hardly know mine own work\" and repudiating all of Motte's changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.\n\n===Lindalino===\nThe five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of [[Lindalino]] against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented [[Dublin]] and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]]'s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the ''Collected Works''. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]] notes in ''The Annotated Gulliver'' that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double lins; hence, Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|editor=Isaac Asimov|title=The Annotated Gulliver's Travels|date=1980|publisher=Clarkson N Potter Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-517-539497|page=[https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160 160]|url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160}}</ref>\n\n==Major themes==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:James Gillray The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.\u2013Vide. Swift's Gulliver- Voyage to Brobdingnag The Metropolitan Museum of Art edit.jpg|thumb|upright|''The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver'' by [[James Gillray]] (1803), (satirising [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[George III of England|George III]]). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n''Gulliver's Travels'' has been the recipient of several designations: from [[Menippean satire]] to a children's story, from proto-science fiction to a forerunner of the modern novel.\n\nPublished seven years after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s successful ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Gulliver's Travels'' may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'', [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.\n\nScholar Allan Bloom points out that Swift's critique of science (the experiments of Laputa) is the first such questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Bloom|title=Giants and Dwarfs: An Outline of Gulliver's Travels|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990|location=New York|pages=47\u201351}}</ref> Swift wrote:\n{{Quote |text=The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour. He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor\u2019s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me \u201cto give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.\u201d I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.}}\n\nA possible reason for the book's classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many different people. Broadly, the book has three themes:\n* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions\n* An inquiry into whether men are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted\n* A restatement of the older \"ancients versus moderns\" controversy previously addressed by Swift in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''\n\nIn storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:\n* The causes of Gulliver's misadventures become more malignant as time goes on\u2014he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.\n* Gulliver's attitude hardens as the book progresses\u2014he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.\n* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part\u2014Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and the forms of government are worse/better/worse/better than Britain's.\n* Gulliver's viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his [[antagonist]]s in the contrasting part\u2014Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.\n* No form of government is ideal\u2014the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.\n* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad\u2014Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver's rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the novel's end.\n\nOf equal interest is the character of Gulliver himself\u2014he progresses from a cheery optimist at the start of the first part to the pompous [[misanthrope]] of the book's conclusion and we may well have to filter our understanding of the work if we are to believe the final misanthrope wrote the whole work. In this sense, ''Gulliver's Travels'' is a very modern and complex novel. There are subtle shifts throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to see all humans, not just those in Houyhnhnm-land, as Yahoos. However, a feminist perspective of ''Gulliver's Travels'' argues that it is [[misogyny]], and not misanthropy, that is shown in Gulliver.<ref name=\"1667-1745\">{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|others=Fox, Christopher|isbn=978-0312066659|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|date = 15 November 1994}}</ref>\n\nThroughout, Gulliver is presented as being gullible.  He generally accepts what he is told at face value; he rarely perceives deeper meanings; and he is an honest man who expects others to be honest. This makes for fun and irony: what Gulliver says can be trusted to be accurate, and he does not always understand the meaning of what he perceives.\n\nAlso, although Gulliver is presented as a commonplace \"[[everyman]]\" with only a basic education, he possesses a remarkable natural gift for language. He quickly becomes fluent in the native tongues of the strange lands in which he finds himself, a literary device that adds verisimilitude and humour to Swift's work.\n\nDespite the depth and subtlety of the book, as well as frequent [[Off-color humor|off-colour]] and [[Black comedy|black humour]], it is often mistakenly classified as a children's story because of the popularity of the Lilliput section (frequently [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]]) as a book for children. Indeed, many adaptations of the story are squarely aimed at a young audience, and one can still buy books entitled ''Gulliver's Travels'' which contain only parts of the Lilliput voyage, and occasionally the Brobdingnag section.\n\n=== Misogyny ===\nSwift uses satire to openly mock [[misogyny]] throughout the book, with one of the most cited examples of this coming from Gulliver's description of a Brobdingnagian woman:\n\n: \"I must confess no Object ever disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape, and Colour.... This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our ''English'' Ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass....\"\n\nThis open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as ''The Lady's Dressing Room'' and ''A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Katharine M.|date=1959|title='My Female Friends': The Misogyny of Jonathan Swift|jstor=40753638|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=1|issue=3|pages=366\u201379}}</ref>\n\nA criticism of Swift's use of misogyny by [[Felicity A. Nussbaum]] proposes the idea that \u201cGulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked.\u201d Gulliver\u2019s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.<ref name=\"1667-1745\"/><!--gender characteristics generate from deeply meaningful personal ethic differences expressly associated with grammatical gender. Popular historical literature more likely create gender as known today, than criticize gender as known today; even if somehow the literature criticized gender as known when authoring. Also, characters rarely form models of behavior unless those characters exhibit difficulty to perfectly imitate but-rather models of behavior form from veritable what-ifs tested in the reader's reality-->\n\nNussbaum goes on to say in her analysis of the misogyny of the stories that in the adventures, particularly in the first story, the satire isn't singularly focussed on satirizing women, but to satirize Gulliver himself as a politically naive and inept giant whose masculine authority comically seems to be in jeopardy <ref>{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift, Jonathan, 1667-1745.|others=Fox, Christopher, 1948-|isbn=0-312-10284-4|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|year = 1995}}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of Swift's use of misogyny delves into Gulliver's repeated use of the word 'nauseous,' and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.\n\n:\"Swift has Gulliver frequently invoke the sensory (as opposed to reflective) word \"nauseous\" to describe this and other magnified images in Brobdingnag not only to reveal the neurotic depths of Gulliver's misogyny, but also to show how male nausea can be used as a pathetic countermeasure against the perceived threat of female consumption. Swift has Gulliver associate these magnified acts of female consumption with the act of \"throwing-up\"\u2014the opposite of and antidote to the act of gastronomic consumption.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Armintor |first=Deborah Needleman |date=2007 |title=The Sexual Politics of Microscopy in Brobdingnag |journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=619\u2013640 |jstor=4625129|doi=10.1353/sel.2007.0022 }}</ref>\n\nThis commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of.  Armintor's comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift's time.  She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lose interest.  This is similar to the progression of Gulliver's time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women's plaything.\n\n=== Comic misanthropy ===\n[[Misanthropy]] is a theme that scholars have identified in ''Gulliver's Travels.''  Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]]'s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.<ref name=\":02\">Case, Arthur E. \u201cFrom \u2018The Significance of ''Gulliver\u2019s Travels''.\u2019\u201d ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P.

Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 180\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn terms of Gulliver's development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage.  According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], but, after he deems the [[Houyhnhnm]]s superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings.  Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect.<ref name=\":02\" />  According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals.<ref name=\":12\" />  This new perception of Gulliver's, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms' judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos.<ref name=\":22\" />  Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver's misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity.  Specifically, Gulliver\u2019s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver\u2019s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy.<ref name=\":12\" />  However, Case points out that Gulliver's dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing.  Gulliver\u2019s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland.<ref name=\":02\" />  But in Stone's view, Gulliver\u2019s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect.  Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.<ref name=\":22\" />  \n\nAnother aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver\u2019s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver\u2019s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity.  As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo.  To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man\u2014''Homo est animal rationale'' (Humans are rational animals)\u2014was prominent in academia around [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]\u2019s time.  Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see [[Porphyrian tree|Porphyrian Tree]]) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings\u2014horses\u2014in the place of humans and vice versa.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nStone points out that ''Gulliver's Travels'' takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift's time period.  From reading travel books, Swift\u2019s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period.  From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical.  Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver\u2019s view; Stone states that the Yahoos\u2019 behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver's identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart.  Thus, Stone sees Gulliver\u2019s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n===Character analysis===\n'''Pedro de Mendez''' is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the [[Houyhnhnms]], his plan is \"to discover some small Island uninhabited\" where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro's crew. Despite Gulliver's appearance\u2014he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse\u2014Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.\n\nThough Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of ''Gulliver's Travels''. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift's satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make \"no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply...vices\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=1726|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|location=|page=490}}</ref> Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver's reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver's words, is \"an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason\".<ref>James Clifford, \"Gulliver's Fourth Voyage: 'hard' and 'soft' Schools of Interpretation.\" ''Quick Springs of Sense: Studies in the Eighteenth Century''.

One of the first critics of the book, referred to as Lord Bolingbroke, criticized Swift for his overt use of misanthropy.<ref name=\":3\" /> Other negative responses to the novel also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts\u2019s peers rejected the novel on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos\u2019s similarities to humans.<ref name=\":4\" /> There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBritish novelist and journalist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] described Swift\u2019s novel as \u201cblasphemous,\u201d citing its critical view of mankind as ludicrous and overly harsh. He concludes his critique by remarking that he cannot understand the origins of Swift\u2019s critiques on humanity.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Cultural influences==\n[[File:Pruszkowski Gulliver and a giant.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gulliver and a giant'', a painting by [[Tadeusz Pruszkowski]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]\n\n{{main|Cultural influence of Gulliver's Travels}}\n\nThe term ''Lilliputian'' has entered many languages as an adjective meaning \"small and delicate\". There is a brand of small cigar called Lilliput, and a series of collectable model houses known as \"Lilliput Lane\". The smallest light bulb fitting (5&nbsp;mm diameter) in the [[Edison screw]] series is called the \"Lilliput Edison screw\". In Dutch and Czech, the words ''Lilliputter'' and ''liliput\u00e1n'', respectively, are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters. Conversely, ''Brobdingnagian'' appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym for ''very large'' or ''gigantic''.\n\nIn like vein, the term ''yahoo'' is often encountered as a [[synonym]] for ''ruffian'' or ''thug''. In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] it is considered a definition for \"a rude, noisy, or violent person\" and its origins attributed to Swift's ''Gulliver's Travels.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yahoo#yahoo|title=yahoo \u2013 definition of yahoo in English |publisher= Oxford Dictionaries}}</ref>\n\nIn the discipline of [[computer architecture]], the terms [[endianness|''big-endian'' and ''little-endian'']] are used to describe two possible ways of laying out [[byte]]s in [[computer memory|memory]]. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, the \"Little-endians\", and those who use the big end, the \"Big-endians\".\n\n===In other works===\n\nMany sequels followed the initial publishing of the ''Travels''. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored ''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTRAAAAMAAJ|title=Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput|year=1727|publisher=J.

Smith }}</ref>]]\n\n===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===\n[[File:Gulliver in Liliput, Bremen.jpg|thumb|Mural depicting Gulliver surrounded by citizens of Lilliput.]]\nThe travel begins with a short preamble in which [[Lemuel Gulliver]] gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.\n\n;4 May 1699&nbsp;\u2013 13 April 1702\n\nDuring his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people, less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} tall, who are inhabitants of the island country of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]]. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on condition that he must not hurt their subjects.\n\nAt first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.\n\nGulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, \"a considerable person at court\", he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home.\n\n===Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag===\n[[File:gulliver.jpg|thumb|''Gulliver exhibited to the Brobdingnag Farmer'' (painting by [[Richard Redgrave]])]]\n\n;20 June 1702&nbsp;\u2013 3 June 1706\n\nGulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship ''Adventure'' is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the [[North American]] continent.\n\nThe grass of [[Brobdingnag]] is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72&nbsp;ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man's step being {{convert|10|yd|m|0}}. The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter [[Glumdalclitch]] cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the Queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the Queen's service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the Queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his \"travelling box\".\n\nBetween small adventures such as fighting giant [[wasp]]s and being carried to the roof by a [[monkey]], he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The King is not happy with Gulliver's accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannons. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England.\n\n===Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan===\n[[File:Laputa - Grandville.jpg|thumb|upright|Gulliver discovers Laputa, the flying island (illustration by [[Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard Grandville|J. J. Grandville]])]]\n\n{{See also|Floating cities and islands in fiction}}\n\n;5 August 1706&nbsp;\u2013 16 April 1710\n\nSetting out again, Gulliver's ship is attacked by [[Piracy|pirates]], and he is [[Marooning|marooned]] close to a desolate rocky island near [[India]]. He is rescued by the [[Floating island (fiction)|flying island]] of [[Laputa]], a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than use armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.\n\nGulliver tours [[Balnibarbi]], the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the [[Royal Society]] and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of [[Lagado]] in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons (see [[Muckraker|muckraking]]). Gulliver is then taken to [[Maldonada (Gulliver's Travels)|Maldonada]], the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.\n\nWhile waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of [[Glubbdubdrib]] which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the \"ancients versus moderns\" theme in the book. The ghosts consist of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Pierre Gassendi]].\n\nOn the island of [[Luggnagg]], he encounters the ''[[struldbrug]]s'', people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.\n\nAfter reaching [[Japan in Gulliver\u2019s Travels|Japan]], Gulliver asks [[Tenno|the Emperor]] \"to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of [[Fumi-e|trampling upon the crucifix]]\", which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.\n\n===Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms===\n[[File:Gulliver u Hvajninim\u016f - Grandville.jpg|thumb|Gulliver in discussion with Houyhnhnms (1856 illustration by [[J.J. Grandville]]).]]\n\n;7 September 1710&nbsp;\u2013 5 December 1715\n\nDespite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a [[wikt:merchantman|merchantman]], as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew who, he believes, have turned against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of deformed savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]].\n\nGulliver becomes a member of a horse's household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver's \"Master,\" the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.\n\nHe returns to his home in England, but is unable to reconcile himself to living among \"Yahoos\" and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.\n\nIt is now generally accepted that the fourth voyage of ''Gulliver's Travels'' does embody a wholly pessimistic view of the place of man and the meaning of his existence in the universe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jan, Firdaus|first=K. M., Shabam|title=Perspectives on Gulliver's Travels|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and history==\nIt is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing ''Gulliver's Travels''. (Much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], whilst Swift stayed there.) Some sources{{which|date=August 2013}} suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, [[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] and others formed the [[Scriblerus Club]] with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the \"travellers' tales\" literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing ''[[Drapier's Letters]]''. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as ''Gulliver's Travels'' was a transparently anti-[[British Whig Party|Whig]] satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish [[pamphlet]]s (the ''Drapier's Letters''). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher [[Benjamin Motte]], who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy.<ref>Clive Probyn, ''Swift, Jonathan (1667\u20131745)'', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: [[Oxford]], 2004)</ref> Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of [[Lindalino]]), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8''s''. ''6''d.''<ref>''Daily Journal'' 28 Oct 1726, \"This day is published\".</ref>\n\nMotte published ''Gulliver's Travels'' anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput''), parodies (''Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...'') and \"keys\" (''Gulliver Decipher'd'' and ''Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd'', the second by [[Edmund Curll]] who had similarly written a \"key\" to Swift's ''[[Tale of a Tub]]'' in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735. Swift's friend [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a set of five ''Verses on Gulliver's Travels'', which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included.\n\n===Faulkner's 1735 edition===\nIn 1735 an Irish publisher, [[George Faulkner]], printed a set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was ''Gulliver's Travels''. As revealed in Faulkner's \"Advertisement to the Reader\", Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte's work by \"a friend of the author\" (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte's amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the ''[[Editio Princeps]]'' of ''Gulliver's Travels'' with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, ''A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson'', which complained of Motte's alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that \"I do hardly know mine own work\" and repudiating all of Motte's changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.\n\n===Lindalino===\nThe five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of [[Lindalino]] against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented [[Dublin]] and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of [[William Wood (ironmaster)|William Wood]]'s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the ''Collected Works''. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]] notes in ''The Annotated Gulliver'' that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double lins; hence, Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|editor=Isaac Asimov|title=The Annotated Gulliver's Travels|date=1980|publisher=Clarkson N Potter Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-517-539497|page=[https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160 160]|url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedgullive0000swif/page/160}}</ref>\n\n==Major themes==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:James Gillray The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.\u2013Vide. Swift's Gulliver- Voyage to Brobdingnag The Metropolitan Museum of Art edit.jpg|thumb|upright|''The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver'' by [[James Gillray]] (1803), (satirising [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[George III of England|George III]]). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n''Gulliver's Travels'' has been the recipient of several designations: from [[Menippean satire]] to a children's story, from proto-science fiction to a forerunner of the modern novel.\n\nPublished seven years after [[Daniel Defoe]]'s successful ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Gulliver's Travels'' may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'', [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.\n\nScholar Allan Bloom points out that Swift's critique of science (the experiments of Laputa) is the first such questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Bloom|title=Giants and Dwarfs: An Outline of Gulliver's Travels|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990|location=New York|pages=47\u201351}}</ref> Swift wrote:\n{{Quote |text=The first man I saw was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour. He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt, that, in eight years more, he should be able to supply the governor\u2019s gardens with sunshine, at a reasonable rate: but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me \u201cto give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.\u201d I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.}}\n\nA possible reason for the book's classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many different people. Broadly, the book has three themes:\n* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions\n* An inquiry into whether men are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted\n* A restatement of the older \"ancients versus moderns\" controversy previously addressed by Swift in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''\n\nIn storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:\n* The causes of Gulliver's misadventures become more malignant as time goes on\u2014he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.\n* Gulliver's attitude hardens as the book progresses\u2014he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.\n* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part\u2014Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and the forms of government are worse/better/worse/better than Britain's.\n* Gulliver's viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his [[antagonist]]s in the contrasting part\u2014Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.\n* No form of government is ideal\u2014the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.\n* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad\u2014Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver's rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the novel's end.\n\nOf equal interest is the character of Gulliver himself\u2014he progresses from a cheery optimist at the start of the first part to the pompous [[misanthrope]] of the book's conclusion and we may well have to filter our understanding of the work if we are to believe the final misanthrope wrote the whole work. In this sense, ''Gulliver's Travels'' is a very modern and complex novel. There are subtle shifts throughout the book, such as when Gulliver begins to see all humans, not just those in Houyhnhnm-land, as Yahoos. However, a feminist perspective of ''Gulliver's Travels'' argues that it is [[misogyny]], and not misanthropy, that is shown in Gulliver.<ref name=\"1667-1745\">{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|others=Fox, Christopher|isbn=978-0312066659|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|date = 15 November 1994}}</ref>\n\nThroughout, Gulliver is presented as being gullible.  He generally accepts what he is told at face value; he rarely perceives deeper meanings; and he is an honest man who expects others to be honest. This makes for fun and irony: what Gulliver says can be trusted to be accurate, and he does not always understand the meaning of what he perceives.\n\nAlso, although Gulliver is presented as a commonplace \"[[everyman]]\" with only a basic education, he possesses a remarkable natural gift for language. He quickly becomes fluent in the native tongues of the strange lands in which he finds himself, a literary device that adds verisimilitude and humour to Swift's work.\n\nDespite the depth and subtlety of the book, as well as frequent [[Off-color humor|off-colour]] and [[Black comedy|black humour]], it is often mistakenly classified as a children's story because of the popularity of the Lilliput section (frequently [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]]) as a book for children. Indeed, many adaptations of the story are squarely aimed at a young audience, and one can still buy books entitled ''Gulliver's Travels'' which contain only parts of the Lilliput voyage, and occasionally the Brobdingnag section.\n\n=== Misogyny ===\nSwift uses satire to openly mock [[misogyny]] throughout the book, with one of the most cited examples of this coming from Gulliver's description of a Brobdingnagian woman:\n\n: \"I must confess no Object ever disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape, and Colour.... This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our ''English'' Ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass....\"\n\nThis open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as ''The Lady's Dressing Room'' and ''A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Katharine M.|date=1959|title='My Female Friends': The Misogyny of Jonathan Swift|jstor=40753638|journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language|volume=1|issue=3|pages=366\u201379}}</ref>\n\nA criticism of Swift's use of misogyny by [[Felicity A. Nussbaum]] proposes the idea that \u201cGulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked.\u201d Gulliver\u2019s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.<ref name=\"1667-1745\"/><!--gender characteristics generate from deeply meaningful personal ethic differences expressly associated with grammatical gender. Popular historical literature more likely create gender as known today, than criticize gender as known today; even if somehow the literature criticized gender as known when authoring. Also, characters rarely form models of behavior unless those characters exhibit difficulty to perfectly imitate but-rather models of behavior form from veritable what-ifs tested in the reader's reality-->\n\nNussbaum goes on to say in her analysis of the misogyny of the stories that in the adventures, particularly in the first story, the satire isn't singularly focussed on satirizing women, but to satirize Gulliver himself as a politically naive and inept giant whose masculine authority comically seems to be in jeopardy <ref>{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's travels : complete, authoritative text with biographical and historical contexts, critical history, and essays from five contemporary critical perspectives|last=Swift, Jonathan, 1667-1745.|others=Fox, Christopher, 1948-|isbn=0-312-10284-4|location=Boston|oclc=31794911|year = 1995}}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of Swift's use of misogyny delves into Gulliver's repeated use of the word 'nauseous,' and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.\n\n:\"Swift has Gulliver frequently invoke the sensory (as opposed to reflective) word \"nauseous\" to describe this and other magnified images in Brobdingnag not only to reveal the neurotic depths of Gulliver's misogyny, but also to show how male nausea can be used as a pathetic countermeasure against the perceived threat of female consumption. Swift has Gulliver associate these magnified acts of female consumption with the act of \"throwing-up\"\u2014the opposite of and antidote to the act of gastronomic consumption.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Armintor |first=Deborah Needleman |date=2007 |title=The Sexual Politics of Microscopy in Brobdingnag |journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=619\u2013640 |jstor=4625129|doi=10.1353/sel.2007.0022 }}</ref>\n\nThis commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of.  Armintor's comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift's time.  She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lose interest.  This is similar to the progression of Gulliver's time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women's plaything.\n\n=== Comic misanthropy ===\n[[Misanthropy]] is a theme that scholars have identified in ''Gulliver's Travels.''  Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]]'s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.<ref name=\":02\">Case, Arthur E. \u201cFrom \u2018The Significance of ''Gulliver\u2019s Travels''.\u2019\u201d ''A Casebook on Gulliver Among the Houyhnhnms'', edited by Milton P.

Foster, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1961, pp. 180\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn terms of Gulliver's development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage.  According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]], but, after he deems the [[Houyhnhnm]]s superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings.  Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect.<ref name=\":02\" />  According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals.<ref name=\":12\" />  This new perception of Gulliver's, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms' judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos.<ref name=\":22\" />  Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver's misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity.  Specifically, Gulliver\u2019s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver\u2019s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy.<ref name=\":12\" />  However, Case points out that Gulliver's dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing.  Gulliver\u2019s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland.<ref name=\":02\" />  But in Stone's view, Gulliver\u2019s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect.  Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.<ref name=\":22\" />  \n\nAnother aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver\u2019s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver\u2019s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity.  As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo.  To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man\u2014''Homo est animal rationale'' (Humans are rational animals)\u2014was prominent in academia around [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]\u2019s time.  Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see [[Porphyrian tree|Porphyrian Tree]]) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings\u2014horses\u2014in the place of humans and vice versa.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nStone points out that ''Gulliver's Travels'' takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift's time period.  From reading travel books, Swift\u2019s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period.  From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical.  Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver\u2019s view; Stone states that the Yahoos\u2019 behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver's identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart.  Thus, Stone sees Gulliver\u2019s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n===Character analysis===\n'''Pedro de Mendez''' is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the [[Houyhnhnms]], his plan is \"to discover some small Island uninhabited\" where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro's crew. Despite Gulliver's appearance\u2014he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse\u2014Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.\n\nThough Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of ''Gulliver's Travels''. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift's satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make \"no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply...vices\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=Gulliver's Travels|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|publisher=|year=1726|isbn=978-0-393-93065-8|location=|page=490}}</ref> Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver's reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver's words, is \"an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason\".<ref>James Clifford, \"Gulliver's Fourth Voyage: 'hard' and 'soft' Schools of Interpretation.\" ''Quick Springs of Sense: Studies in the Eighteenth Century''.

It became known for its insightful take on morality, expanding its reputation beyond just humorous satire.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nDespite its initial positive reception, the book faced backlash. One of the first critics of the book, referred to as Lord Bolingbroke, criticized Swift for his overt use of misanthropy.<ref name=\":3\" /> Other negative responses to the novel also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts\u2019s peers rejected the novel on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos\u2019s similarities to humans.<ref name=\":4\" /> There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBritish novelist and journalist [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] described Swift\u2019s novel as \u201cblasphemous,\u201d citing its critical view of mankind as ludicrous and overly harsh. He concludes his critique by remarking that he cannot understand the origins of Swift\u2019s critiques on humanity.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Cultural influences==\n[[File:Pruszkowski Gulliver and a giant.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gulliver and a giant'', a painting by [[Tadeusz Pruszkowski]] ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]\n\n{{main|Cultural influence of Gulliver's Travels}}\n\nThe term ''Lilliputian'' has entered many languages as an adjective meaning \"small and delicate\". There is a brand of small cigar called Lilliput, and a series of collectable model houses known as \"Lilliput Lane\". The smallest light bulb fitting (5&nbsp;mm diameter) in the [[Edison screw]] series is called the \"Lilliput Edison screw\". In Dutch and Czech, the words ''Lilliputter'' and ''liliput(\u00e1)n'', respectively, are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters. Conversely, ''Brobdingnagian'' appears in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as a synonym for ''very large'' or ''gigantic''.\n\nIn like vein, the term ''yahoo'' is often encountered as a [[synonym]] for ''ruffian'' or ''thug''. In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] it is considered a definition for \"a rude, noisy, or violent person\" and its origins attributed to Swift's ''Gulliver's Travels.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yahoo#yahoo|title=yahoo \u2013 definition of yahoo in English |publisher= Oxford Dictionaries}}</ref>\n\nIn the discipline of [[computer architecture]], the terms [[endianness|''big-endian'' and ''little-endian'']] are used to describe two possible ways of laying out [[byte]]s in [[computer memory|memory]]. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, the \"Little-endians\", and those who use the big end, the \"Big-endians\".\n\n===In other works===\n\nMany sequels followed the initial publishing of the ''Travels''. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored ''Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZTRAAAAMAAJ|title=Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput|year=1727|publisher=J. Roberts|via=Google Books}}</ref> published 1727, which expands the account of Gulliver's stays in Lilliput and Blefuscu by adding several gossipy anecdotes about scandalous episodes at the Lilliputian court.
