Previously, the reigning Drivers' Champion's team had simply swapped car numbers with the previous Drivers' Champion's team to carry numbers 1 and 2, with all other teams retaining their existing numbers. For 1996 the reigning Drivers' Champion was given number 1 and his teammate number 2 with the rest of the teams numbered in the order of their finishing position in the previous year's Constructors' Championship. Any new teams were allocated the following numbers.\n\nIn 1995, the cars' cockpit opening had been made larger and the sides had been raised in order to provide better head protection for the driver; these sides were raised even higher (to mid-helmet height) for 1996, along with a wraparound head restraint made of foam to prevent head injuries such as those suffered by [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] during qualifying for the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix]].

Any new teams were allocated the following numbers.\n\nIn 1995, the cars' cockpit opening was made larger and the sides were raised in order to provide better head protection for the driver; these sides were raised even higher (to mid-helmet height) for 1996, along with a wraparound head restraint made of foam to prevent head injuries such as those suffered by [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] during qualifying for the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix]]. Needle-like nosecone designs with a sharp point, such as the [[McLaren MP4/10]], [[Forti FG01]] and [[Tyrrell 023]], were also banned in favour of more blunt nose sections.<ref name=dukes/>\n\n== Season report ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}\n[[Damon Hill]] won the [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|season opener]] from [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams']] teammate [[Jacques Villeneuve]] with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari's]] [[Eddie Irvine]] finishing third.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/1996/australie/classement.aspx|title=Australia 1996 - Result \u2022 STATS F1|website=www.statsf1.com|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> Villeneuve was leading but late on in the race the team found out that Villeneuve had an oil leak and ordered him to swap places with teammate Hill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/motor/story/f1-1996-australian-gp-recap-031015|title=Race of firsts: Remembering the 1996 Australian GP|last=Reiman|first=Samuel|date=10 March 2015|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Results and standings ==\n\n=== Grands Prix ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%\"\n|-\n!

A Sacramento detective strongly believed that the East Area Rapist was responsible for the Goleta attacks, but the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department attributed them to a local career criminal who was later murdered.

According to Leslie D'Ambrosia, primary author of the profile, the Golden State Killer probably had the following characteristics:<ref name=\"PsychologicalProfile\" />\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=32em|\n* An emotional age equivalent to a 26- to 30-year-old at the time the murders began in 1979\n* Engaged in [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] behavior and brutal sex in his personal life\n* Engaged in sex with prostitutes\n* Had some knowledge of police investigative methods and evidence-gathering techniques\n* Sexually functional, capable of ejaculation with consenting and non-consenting partners\n* Dressed well and would not stand out in upscale neighborhoods\n* Lived or worked near Ventura, California, in 1980\n* Good physical condition\n* Skilled, experienced [[Burglary|cat burglar]], and may have begun as such\n* Had a criminal record as a teenager which was [[Expungement|expunged]]\n* Had some means of income, but did not work in the early-morning hours\n* Hated women for actual (or perceived) wrongs\n* If married, probably had a submissive spouse who tolerated his sexually-deviant behavior\n* Intelligent and articulate\n* Probably began as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]] in his late teens or early twenties\n* Neat and well-organized in his personal life, and drove a well-maintained car\n* Peeped in the windows of many people who were not attacked\n* Possibly unmarried, and did not enter into long-term relationships\n* Self-assured and confident\n* Would continue committing violent crimes until incapacitated by prison, death, or other intervention\n* Would have been described by those who knew him as arrogant, domineering, manipulative, and a chronic liar\n}}\n\nThe profile speculated that the killer might have been incarcerated after Janelle Cruz's murder or killed in the commission of a similar crime; it suggested a review of late-1980s [[Hot prowl burglary|hot prowl burglaries]] in which a lone male offender had been killed. It indicated a slight chance that the Golden State Killer committed suicide, and that he was unlikely to be confined in a mental institution.<ref name=\"PsychologicalProfile\" />\n\nAccording to the profile, [[teleprinter]] bulletins were broadcast to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States after the original homicides. The bulletins requested information on similar home invasions involving sexual assault, murder, bludgeoning, multiple victims, and bondage. {{As of|2015}}, no similar crimes had been reported.

It indicated a slight chance that the Golden State Killer committed suicide, and that he was unlikely to be confined in a mental institution.<ref name=\"PsychologicalProfile\" />\n\nAccording to the profile, [[teleprinter]] bulletins were broadcast to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States after the original homicides. The bulletins requested information on similar home invasions involving sexual assault, murder, bludgeoning, multiple victims, and bondage. {{As of|2015}}, no similar crimes had been reported.

Her research there was on anti-[[malaria]]l immune responses. In 1985, she joined the recently established department of clinical tropical medicine at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] (LSHTM), working with [[Keith McAdam]]. Her early research at LSHTM was on immunity to [[leprosy]], particularly the [[T cell|T-cell]] response to ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. She spent time at the [[Aga Khan University]] in [[Karachi]] where she began a long-term collaboration with the Pakistani immunologist, Rabia Hussain.<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=HV&I_auto /> The clinical presentation of leprosy shows a range of possible symptoms, and Dockrell and Hussain have investigated the way in which the body's anti-mycobacterial immune response determines what form of disease occurs. They have also researched methods to diagnose the disease.<ref name=Kelly />\n\nMore recently, Dockrell has switched her research focus to [[tuberculosis]], another [[mycobacteria]]l disease, an area in which she has contributed significant advances. Her work has focused on the immune responses to the bacterium. She has studied the [[CD8]]<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to mycobacteria, and characterised the profile of [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]]s such as [[cytokine]]s both to natural infection and to [[vaccination]] with the [[BCG vaccine]]. In collaboration with the [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] Paul Fine (Karonga Prevention Study, [[Malawi]]) and others, she has tried to elucidate why BCG vaccination generates different levels of protection when given in different contexts, such as African countries compared with the UK.<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=HV&I_auto /> She has studied the role in tuberculosis of concurrent infections with [[helminth]] parasites as well as non-infectious diseases such as [[diabetes]].

She has spent most of her career at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], where as of 2020 she is a professor of immunology. She was the first female president of the [[Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]]. [[Jimmy Whitworth]] of the [[Wellcome Trust]] describes her as \"a marvellous ambassador for global health and research.\"<ref name=Kelly />\n\n==Early life and education==\nDockrell was born in Ireland in 1952<ref name=RSTMH_pres /> and brought up in [[Dublin]]. Her father held medical and dentistry qualifications. She was educated at [[Alexandra College|Alexandra School and College]], Dublin, and [[Trinity College Dublin]], where she studied natural sciences, graduating in [[microbiology]]. She moved to London for her postgraduate education. Her PhD (1978) was from the Royal Dental Hospital of London (now part of [[St Thomas' Hospital]]), researching [[Sjogren syndrome]], a human [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]; her supervisor was [[John S. Greenspan|John Greenspan]].<ref name=Kelly>{{citation |last1=Morris |first1=Kelly |title=Hazel Dockrell: Ambassador for international health research |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=379 |page=211 |year=2012 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60090-7 |pmid=22265620}}</ref><ref name=HV&I_auto>{{citation |last1=Dockrell|first1=H.

Her research there was on anti-[[malaria]]l immune responses. In 1985, she joined the recently established department of clinical tropical medicine at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] (LSHTM), working with [[Keith McAdam]]. Her early research at LSHTM was on immunity to [[leprosy]], particularly the [[T cell|T-cell]] response to ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. She spent time at the [[Aga Khan University]] in [[Karachi]] where she began a long-term collaboration with the Pakistani immunologist, Rabia Hussain.<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=HV&I_auto /> The clinical presentation of leprosy shows a range of possible symptoms, and Dockrell and Hussain have investigated the way in which the body's anti-mycobacterial immune response determines what form of disease occurs. They have also researched methods to diagnose the disease.<ref name=Kelly />\n\nMore recently, Dockrell has switched her research focus to [[tuberculosis]], another [[mycobacteria]]l disease, an area in which she has contributed significant advances. Her work has focused on the immune responses to the bacterium. She has studied the [[CD8]]<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to mycobacteria, and characterised the profile of [[biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]]s such as [[cytokine]]s both to natural infection and to [[vaccination]] with the [[BCG vaccine]]. In collaboration with the [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] Paul Fine (Karonga Prevention Study, [[Malawi]]) and others, she has tried to elucidate why BCG vaccination generates different levels of protection when given in different contexts, such as African countries compared with the UK.<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=HV&I_auto /> She has studied the role in tuberculosis of concurrent infections with [[helminth]] parasites as well as non-infectious diseases such as [[diabetes]]. She has also promoted global collaborative research into [[tuberculosis vaccines|new vaccines against the disease]] within the European Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative.<ref name=HV&I_auto />\n\nAs of 2020, Dockrell is a professor of immunology at LSHTM.<ref name=LSHTM_bio /> In addition to her own research work, Dockrell was the deputy director of research at LSHTM and, as of 2020, advises its director [[Peter Piot]] on collaborative programmes with Africa.<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=LSHTM_bio>{{citation |url=https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/dockrell.hazel |title=Professor Hazel Dockrell: BA PhD: Professor of Immunology, Special Advisor on Overseas Partnerships in Africa |publisher=[[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] |accessdate=15 February 2020 }}</ref> In the latter role, she has focused on improving the research capabilities of the multiple African institutes with which LSHTM collaborates.<ref name=Kelly /> Dockrell was the first woman to serve as president of the [[Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] (2009\u201311).<ref name=Kelly /><ref name=RSTMH_pres>{{citation |last1=Hay|first1=S.

It was founded as the '''North Korean Arts Alliance''' on March 25, 1946,\n\n== Function ==\nAs a representative arts federation of [[North Korea]], it serves as a unified organization that oversees literary activities in all fields. The federation belongs to the [[Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK).\n\nTheir main task is to instill the ideology of the WPK in the literature and arts. To do this, artists receive ideology education and guidance in creative works. Writers and artists of North Korea are obligated to join the KFLA and its affiliated alliances.\n\nAs one of the main extra-governmental organizations of the WPK and having the power to appoint or even expel, artists, the federation is considered as one with great influence. For example, the [[North Korean Ministry of Culture and Arts]] and the KFLA have joint control over the literary field. Their affiliations independently issue bulletins.\n\n== History ==\nThis federation was previously called the North Korean Arts Alliance, initiated in [[Pyongyang]] on March 25, 1946. Before then, communist artists were also active in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|United States Army Military Government]] regions of [[Seoul]], and formed their own group. The [[Pyeongnam Professional Alliance]], led by [[Ri Ki-yong]] and [[Han Sorya]], was a regional group formed in the Soviet army government areas.\n\nWith the fixation of the division, the Pyeongnam Professional Alliance merged with [[Pyongyang Arts & Culture Association]] which claimed to promote pure arts, expanding into a nationwide organization with a new name, the North Korean Arts Alliance. In October of the same year, the organization expanded yet again into the North Korean Federation of Literature and Arts (NKFLA), with seven divided affiliations in: literature, music, art, drama, film, dance and photography.\n\nAfter the [[Korean War]], pro-communist artists in Seoul who went to the North were integrated into the group, and in 1951, its current name, the Korean Federation of Literature and Arts, was given. At that time, there was an influx of a line from the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]], and their great purge in 1953 influenced the [[National Artists' Art Competition]], greatly reducing the number of members. All other groups were dissolved, leaving only the [[Korean Writers' Alliance]], [[Korean Artists' Alliance]], and [[Korean Composers' Alliance]].\n\nThe current federation was reorganized in March of 1961, after clearing the purge of the South Chosun Worker's Party. The previously divided seven affiliations: Korean Writers' Alliance, [[Korean Musicians' Alliance]], Korean Artists' Alliance, [[Korean Dancers' Alliance]], [[Korean Theater Alliance]], [[Korean Film Alliance]], [[Korean Photography Alliance]], and Korean Composers' Alliance were added on in the 1970s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|North Korea|Literature|Arts}}\n*[[Culture of North Korea]]\n*[[Korean art]]\n*[[North Korean literature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*\uae40, \uc131\ubbfc (2002).

It was founded as the '''North Korean Arts Alliance''' on March 25, 1946,\n\n== Function ==\nAs a representative arts federation of [[North Korea]], it serves as a unified organization that oversees literary activities in all fields. The federation belongs to the [[Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK).\n\nTheir main task is to instill the ideology of the WPK in the literature and arts. To do this, artists receive ideology education and guidance in creative works. Writers and artists of North Korea are obligated to join the KFLA and its affiliated alliances.\n\nAs one of the main extra-governmental organizations of the WPK and having the power to appoint or even expel, artists, the federation is considered as one with great influence. For example, the [[North Korean Ministry of Culture and Arts]] and the KFLA have joint control over the literary field. Their affiliations independently issue bulletins.\n\n== History ==\nThis federation was previously called the North Korean Arts Alliance, initiated in [[Pyongyang]] on March 25, 1946. Before then, communist artists were also active in the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|United States Army Military Government]] regions of [[Seoul]], and formed their own group. The [[Pyeongnam Professional Alliance]], led by [[Ri Ki-yong]] and [[Han Sorya]], was a regional group formed in the Soviet army government areas.\n\nWith the fixation of the division, the Pyeongnam Professional Alliance merged with [[Pyongyang Arts & Culture Association]] which claimed to promote pure arts, expanding into a nationwide organization with a new name, the North Korean Arts Alliance. In October of the same year, the organization expanded yet again into the North Korean Federation of Literature and Arts (NKFLA), with seven divided affiliations in: literature, music, art, drama, film, dance and photography.\n\nAfter the [[Korean War]], pro-communist artists in Seoul who went to the North were integrated into the group, and in 1951, its current name, the Korean Federation of Literature and Arts, was given. At that time, there was an influx of a line from the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]], and their great purge in 1953 influenced the [[National Artists' Art Competition]], greatly reducing the number of members. All other groups were dissolved, leaving only the [[Korean Writers' Alliance]], [[Korean Artists' Alliance]], and [[Korean Composers' Alliance]].\n\nThe current federation was reorganized in March of 1961, after clearing the purge of the South Chosun Worker's Party. The previously divided seven affiliations: Korean Writers' Alliance, [[Korean Musicians' Alliance]], Korean Artists' Alliance, [[Korean Dancers' Alliance]], [[Korean Theater Alliance]], [[Korean Film Alliance]], [[Korean Photography Alliance]], and Korean Composers' Alliance were added on in the 1970s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|North Korea|Literature|Arts}}\n*[[Culture of North Korea]]\n*[[Korean art]]\n*[[North Korean literature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*\uae40, \uc131\ubbfc (2002).

Such freedom implies the absence of interference from an overreaching [[State (polity)|state]]; its preservation may be sought through [[constitution]] or other [[legal]] protection and security.\n\nWith respect to governmental information, any government may distinguish which materials are public or protected from disclosure to the public. State materials are protected due to either of 2 reasons: the [[classified information|classification of information]] as sensitive, classified or secret, or the relevance of the information to protecting the [[national interest]]. Many governments are also subject to \"sunshine laws\" or [[freedom of information legislation]] that are used to define the ambit of national interest and enable citizens to request access to government-held information.\n\nThe [[United Nations]]' 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|website=United Nations |accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis philosophy is usually accompanied by [[legislation]] ensuring various degrees of freedom of [[science|scientific]] [[research]] (known as [[scientific freedom]]), publishing, and press. The depth to which these laws are entrenched in a country's legal system can go as far down as its [[constitution]]. The concept of [[freedom of speech]] is often covered by the same laws as freedom of the press, thereby giving equal treatment to spoken and published expression. [[Sweden]] was the first country in the world to adopt freedom of the press into its constitution with the ''Freedom of the Press Act'' of 1766.\n\n== Relationship to self-publishing ==\nFreedom of the press is not construed as an absence of interference or outside entities, such as a government or religious organization, rather  as a right for authors to have their works published by other people.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|first1 = L.

Shortly thereafter, he was arrested.]]\nBeyond legal definitions, several [[non-governmental organization]]s use other criteria to judge the level of press freedom around the world. Some create subjective lists, while others are based on quantitative data:\n* [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers the number of journalists murdered, expelled or harassed, and the existence of a [[State media|state monopoly]] on TV and radio, as well as the existence of [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] in the media, and the overall independence of media as well as the difficulties that foreign reporters may face to rank countries in levels of press freedom.\n* The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) systematically tracks the number of journalists killed and imprisoned in reprisal for their work. It says it uses the tools of [[journalism]] to help journalists by tracking press freedom issues through independent research, fact-finding missions, and a network of foreign correspondents, including local working journalists in countries around the world. CPJ shares information on breaking cases with other press freedom organizations worldwide through the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of more than 119 free expression organizations. CPJ also tracks impunity in cases of journalist murders. CPJ staff applies strict criteria for each case; researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death or imprisonment.\n* [[Freedom House]]  studies the more general political and economic environments of each nation in order to determine whether relationships of dependence exist that limit in practice the level of press freedom that might exist in theory. Panels of experts assess the press freedom score and draft each country summary according to a weighted scoring system that analyzes the political, economic, legal and safety situation for journalists based on a 100-point scale. It then categorizes countries as having a free, party free, or not free press.\n\n=== Annual report on journalists killed and Prison Census ===\nEach year, [[The Committee To Protect Journalists|The Committee to Protect Journalists]] produces a comprehensive list of all working journalists killed in relation to their employment, including profiles of each deceased journalist within an exhaustive database, and annual census of incarcerated journalists (as of midnight, December 1).

[[Press Freedom Index]] list is based on responses to surveys sent to journalists that are members of partner organizations of the RWB, as well as related specialists such as researchers, jurists, and human rights activists. The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media as well as other indirect sources of pressure against the free press, such as non-governmental groups.\n\nIn 2019, the ten countries with the most press freedom were, in order: [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jamaica]], [[Belgium]], and [[Costa Rica]].

To this end, most non-democratic societies employ state-run news organizations to promote the propaganda critical to maintaining an existing political power base and suppress (often very brutally, through the use of police, military, or intelligence agencies) any significant attempts by the media or individual journalists to challenge the approved \"government line\" on contentious issues. In such countries, journalists operating on the fringes of what is deemed to be acceptable will very often find themselves the subject of considerable intimidation by agents of the state.

Fifty years earlier, at a time of [[English Civil War|civil war]], [[John Milton]] wrote his [[pamphlet]] ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644).<ref name=\"Sanders\">{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 66| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}</ref> In this work Milton argued forcefully against this form of government censorship and parodied the idea, writing \"when as debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must not stir forth without a visible jailer in their title.\" Although at the time it did little to halt the practice of licensing, it would be viewed later a significant milestone as one of the most eloquent defenses of [[News media|press]] freedom.<ref name=\"Sanders\"/>\n\nMilton's central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason and distinguishing right from wrong, good from bad. In order to be able to exercise this ration right, the individual must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in \u201ca free and open encounter.\" From Milton's writings developed the concept of the open [[marketplace of ideas]], the idea that when people argue against each other, the good arguments will prevail. One form of speech that was widely restricted in Great Britain was [[seditious libel]], and laws were in place that made criticizing the government a crime. The King was above public criticism and statements critical of the government were forbidden, according to the English Court of the [[Star Chamber]]. Truth was not a defense to seditious libel because the goal was to prevent and punish all condemnation of the government.\n\nLocke contributed to the [[Statute of Anne#Lapse of the Licensing Act|lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695]], whereupon the press needed no license.  Still, many libels were tried throughout the 18th century, until \"the Society of the Bill of Rights\" led by [[John Horne Tooke]] and [[John Wilkes]] organized a campaign to publish Parliamentary Debates. This culminated in  three defeats of the Crown in the 1770 cases of Almon, of Miller and of [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]], who all had published one of the [[Letters of Junius]], and the unsuccessful arrest of [[John Wheble]] in 1771. Thereafter the Crown was much more careful in the application of [[libel]]; for example, in the aftermath of the [[Peterloo Massacre]], [[Francis Burdett|Burdett]] was convicted, whereas by contrast the [[Junius]] affair was over a [[satire]] and sarcasm about the non-lethal conduct and policies of government.\n\nIn Britain's American colonies, the first editors discovered their readers enjoyed it when they criticized the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The defense lawyers argued that according to English common law, the truth was a valid defense against libel. The jury acquitted  Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies, and the satirical attack on government became common features in American newspapers.<ref>Alison Olson, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eal/summary/v035/35.3olson.html \"The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America\"], ''Early American Literature'', vol.35 no.3 (2000), pp. 223\u201345.</ref>\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] in 1869 in his book ''[[On Liberty]]''  approached the problem of authority versus liberty from the viewpoint of a 19th-century [[utilitarian]]: The individual has the right of expressing himself so long as he does not harm other individuals. The good society is one in which the greatest number of persons enjoy the greatest possible amount of happiness. Applying these general principles of liberty to freedom of expression, Mill states that if we silence an opinion, we may silence the truth. The individual freedom of expression is therefore essential to the well-being of society. Mill wrote:\n:If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and one, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxA-AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10|year=1867|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe December 1817 Trials of writer and satirist [[William Hone]] for publishing three political pamphlets is considered a landmark in the fight for a free press.\n\n====Denmark\u2013Norway====\nBetween September 4, 1770 and October 7, 1771 the kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had the most unrestricted freedom of press of any country in [[Europe]]. This occurred during the regime of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]], whose second act was to abolish the old censorship laws. However, due to the great amount of mostly anonymous pamphlets published that was critical and often slanderous towards Struensee's own regime, he reinstated some restrictions regarding the freedom of press a year later, October 7, 1771.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=David Hume and the Danish Debate about Freedom of the Press in the 1770s\n|first=John Christian |last=Laursen\n|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=59 |issue=1 |date=January 1998|pages=167\u201372 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1998.0004|jstor=3654060}}</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n{{See also|Censorship in Italy}}\n[[File:Statuto_Albertino_Avviso.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Statuto_Albertino_Avviso.jpg|thumb|305x305px|The Statute was adopted as the constitution of the Kingdom of Italy, granting freedom of the press.]]\nAfter the [[Italian unification]] in 1861, the [[Albertine Statute]] of 1848 was adopted as the constitution of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realising that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.\n\nIn 2012 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Chinese government to lift restrictions on media access to the region and allow independent and impartial monitors to visit and assess conditions in Tibet.

Political pressure on media is mostly done indirectly. One tool widely used by the government is to cut off \u2018unfriendly\u2019 media from governmental advertising. Using draconian laws the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In addition, media is also threatened by non-state actors involved in the current conflict.

Almost every conventional mode of media and information dissemination has a modern counterpart that offers significant potential advantages to journalists seeking to maintain and enhance their freedom of speech. A few simple examples of such phenomena include:\n* [[Satellite television]] versus [[terrestrial television]]: Whilst terrestrial television is relatively easy to manage and manipulate, satellite television is much more difficult to control as journalistic content can easily be broadcast from other jurisdictions beyond the control of individual governments. An example of this in the Middle East is the satellite broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]]. This Arabic-language media channel operates out of [[Qatar]], whose government is relatively liberal compared to many of its neighboring states. As such, its views and content are often problematic to a number of governments in the region and beyond. However, because of the increased affordability and miniaturisation of satellite technology (e.g. dishes and receivers) it is simply not practicable for most states to control popular access to the channel.\n* Internet-based publishing (e.g., [[blog]]ging, [[social media]]) vs. traditional [[publishing]]: Traditional magazines and newspapers rely on physical resources (e.g.,&nbsp;offices, printing presses) that can easily be targeted and forced to close down. Internet-based publishing systems can be run using ubiquitous and inexpensive equipment and can operate from any global jurisdiction. Nations and organisations are increasingly resorting to legal measures to take control of online publications, using national security, anti-terror measures and [[DMCA takedown|copyright laws]] to issue takedown notices and restrict opposition speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/01/how-us-copyright-law-is-being-used-to-take-down-co.php|title=How U.S. copyright law is being used to take down Correa's critics in Ecuador - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>\n* Internet, anonymity software and [[strong cryptography]]: In addition to Internet-based publishing the Internet in combination with anonymity software such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and [[cryptography]] allows for [[Source (journalism)|sources]] to remain anonymous and sustain confidentiality while delivering information to or [[secure communication|securely communicating]] with journalists anywhere in the world in an instant (e.g. [[SecureDrop]], [[WikiLeaks]])\n* [[VOIP|Voice over Internet protocol]] (VOIP) vs. conventional [[telephony]]: Although conventional telephony systems are easily tapped and recorded, modern VOIP technology can employ low-cost strong cryptography to evade surveillance. As VOIP and similar technologies become more widespread they are likely to make the effective monitoring of journalists (and their contacts and activities) a very difficult task for governments.\n\nNaturally, governments are responding to the challenges posed by new media technologies by deploying increasingly sophisticated technology of their own (a notable example being China's attempts to impose control through a state-run [[internet service provider]] that controls access to the Internet) but it seems that this will become an increasingly difficult task as journalists continue to find new ways to exploit technology and stay one step ahead of the generally slower-moving government institutions that attempt to censor them.\n\nIn May 2010, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation intended to promote a free press around the world, a bipartisan measure inspired by the murder in [[Pakistan]] of [[Daniel Pearl]], the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter, shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The legislation, called the [[Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act]], requires the [[United States Department of State]] to expand its scrutiny of news media restrictions and intimidation as part of its annual review of [[human rights]] in each country.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |title=U.S. to Promote Press Freedom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/18press.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 May 2010}}</ref> In 2012 the Obama Administration collected communication records from 20 separate home and office lines for [[Associated Press]] reporters over a two-month period, possibly in an effort to curtail government leaks to the press.

Such freedom implies the absence of interference from an overreaching [[State (polity)|state]]; its preservation may be sought through [[constitution]] or other [[legal]] protection and security.\n\nWith respect to governmental information, any government may distinguish which materials are public or protected from disclosure to the public. State materials are protected due to either of 2 reasons: the [[classified information|classification of information]] as sensitive, classified or secret, or the relevance of the information to protecting the [[national interest]]. Many governments are also subject to \"sunshine laws\" or [[freedom of information legislation]] that are used to define the ambit of national interest and enable citizens to request access to government-held information.\n\nThe [[United Nations]]' 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|website=United Nations |accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis philosophy is usually accompanied by [[legislation]] ensuring various degrees of freedom of [[science|scientific]] [[research]] (known as [[scientific freedom]]), publishing, and press. The depth to which these laws are entrenched in a country's legal system can go as far down as its [[constitution]]. The concept of [[freedom of speech]] is often covered by the same laws as freedom of the press, thereby giving equal treatment to spoken and published expression. [[Sweden]] was the first country in the world to adopt freedom of the press into its constitution with the ''Freedom of the Press Act'' of 1766.\n\n== Relationship to self-publishing ==\nFreedom of the press is not construed as an absence of interference or outside entities, such as a government or religious organization, rather  as a right for authors to have their works published by other people.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|first1 = L.

Shortly thereafter, he was arrested.]]\nBeyond legal definitions, several [[non-governmental organization]]s use other criteria to judge the level of press freedom around the world. Some create subjective lists, while others are based on quantitative data:\n* [[Reporters Without Borders]] considers the number of journalists murdered, expelled or harassed, and the existence of a [[State media|state monopoly]] on TV and radio, as well as the existence of [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] in the media, and the overall independence of media as well as the difficulties that foreign reporters may face to rank countries in levels of press freedom.\n* The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) systematically tracks the number of journalists killed and imprisoned in reprisal for their work. It says it uses the tools of [[journalism]] to help journalists by tracking press freedom issues through independent research, fact-finding missions, and a network of foreign correspondents, including local working journalists in countries around the world. CPJ shares information on breaking cases with other press freedom organizations worldwide through the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of more than 119 free expression organizations. CPJ also tracks impunity in cases of journalist murders. CPJ staff applies strict criteria for each case; researchers independently investigate and verify the circumstances behind each death or imprisonment.\n* [[Freedom House]]  studies the more general political and economic environments of each nation in order to determine whether relationships of dependence exist that limit in practice the level of press freedom that might exist in theory. Panels of experts assess the press freedom score and draft each country summary according to a weighted scoring system that analyzes the political, economic, legal and safety situation for journalists based on a 100-point scale. It then categorizes countries as having a free, party free, or not free press.\n\n=== Annual report on journalists killed and Prison Census ===\nEach year, [[The Committee To Protect Journalists|The Committee to Protect Journalists]] produces a comprehensive list of all working journalists killed in relation to their employment, including profiles of each deceased journalist within an exhaustive database, and annual census of incarcerated journalists (as of midnight, December 1).

The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media as well as other indirect sources of pressure against the free press, such as non-governmental groups.\n\nIn 2019, the ten countries with the most press freedom were, in order: [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jamaica]], [[Belgium]], and [[Costa Rica]].

In such countries, journalists operating on the fringes of what is deemed to be acceptable will very often find themselves the subject of considerable intimidation by agents of the state.

No publication was allowed without the accompaniment of a government-granted license. Fifty years earlier, at a time of [[English Civil War|civil war]], [[John Milton]] wrote his [[pamphlet]] ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644).<ref name=\"Sanders\">{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 66| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}</ref> In this work Milton argued forcefully against this form of government censorship and parodied the idea, writing \"when as debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but unoffensive books must not stir forth without a visible jailer in their title.\" Although at the time it did little to halt the practice of licensing, it would be viewed later a significant milestone as one of the most eloquent defenses of [[News media|press]] freedom.<ref name=\"Sanders\"/>\n\nMilton's central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason and distinguishing right from wrong, good from bad. In order to be able to exercise this ration right, the individual must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in \u201ca free and open encounter.\" From Milton's writings developed the concept of the open [[marketplace of ideas]], the idea that when people argue against each other, the good arguments will prevail. One form of speech that was widely restricted in Great Britain was [[seditious libel]], and laws were in place that made criticizing the government a crime. The King was above public criticism and statements critical of the government were forbidden, according to the English Court of the [[Star Chamber]]. Truth was not a defense to seditious libel because the goal was to prevent and punish all condemnation of the government.\n\nLocke contributed to the [[Statute of Anne#Lapse of the Licensing Act|lapse of the Licensing Act in 1695]], whereupon the press needed no license.  Still, many libels were tried throughout the 18th century, until \"the Society of the Bill of Rights\" led by [[John Horne Tooke]] and [[John Wilkes]] organized a campaign to publish Parliamentary Debates. This culminated in  three defeats of the Crown in the 1770 cases of Almon, of Miller and of [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]], who all had published one of the [[Letters of Junius]], and the unsuccessful arrest of [[John Wheble]] in 1771. Thereafter the Crown was much more careful in the application of [[libel]]; for example, in the aftermath of the [[Peterloo Massacre]], [[Francis Burdett|Burdett]] was convicted, whereas by contrast the [[Junius]] affair was over a [[satire]] and sarcasm about the non-lethal conduct and policies of government.\n\nIn Britain's American colonies, the first editors discovered their readers enjoyed it when they criticized the local governor; the governors discovered they could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after the publication of satirical attacks. The defense lawyers argued that according to English common law, the truth was a valid defense against libel. The jury acquitted  Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies, and the satirical attack on government became common features in American newspapers.<ref>Alison Olson, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eal/summary/v035/35.3olson.html \"The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America\"], ''Early American Literature'', vol.35 no.3 (2000), pp. 223\u201345.</ref>\n\n[[John Stuart Mill]] in 1869 in his book ''[[On Liberty]]''  approached the problem of authority versus liberty from the viewpoint of a 19th-century [[utilitarian]]: The individual has the right of expressing himself so long as he does not harm other individuals. The good society is one in which the greatest number of persons enjoy the greatest possible amount of happiness. Applying these general principles of liberty to freedom of expression, Mill states that if we silence an opinion, we may silence the truth. The individual freedom of expression is therefore essential to the well-being of society. Mill wrote:\n:If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and one, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxA-AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10|year=1867|page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe December 1817 Trials of writer and satirist [[William Hone]] for publishing three political pamphlets is considered a landmark in the fight for a free press.\n\n====Denmark\u2013Norway====\nBetween September 4, 1770 and October 7, 1771 the kingdom of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] had the most unrestricted freedom of press of any country in [[Europe]].

Not much is known about the extent to which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realising that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.\n\nIn 2012 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Chinese government to lift restrictions on media access to the region and allow independent and impartial monitors to visit and assess conditions in Tibet.

Almost every conventional mode of media and information dissemination has a modern counterpart that offers significant potential advantages to journalists seeking to maintain and enhance their freedom of speech. A few simple examples of such phenomena include:\n* [[Satellite television]] versus [[terrestrial television]]: Whilst terrestrial television is relatively easy to manage and manipulate, satellite television is much more difficult to control as journalistic content can easily be broadcast from other jurisdictions beyond the control of individual governments. An example of this in the Middle East is the satellite broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]]. This Arabic-language media channel operates out of [[Qatar]], whose government is relatively liberal compared to many of its neighboring states. As such, its views and content are often problematic to a number of governments in the region and beyond. However, because of the increased affordability and miniaturisation of satellite technology (e.g. dishes and receivers) it is simply not practicable for most states to control popular access to the channel.\n* Internet-based publishing (e.g., [[blog]]ging, [[social media]]) vs. traditional [[publishing]]: Traditional magazines and newspapers rely on physical resources (e.g.,&nbsp;offices, printing presses) that can easily be targeted and forced to close down. Internet-based publishing systems can be run using ubiquitous and inexpensive equipment and can operate from any global jurisdiction. Nations and organisations are increasingly resorting to legal measures to take control of online publications, using national security, anti-terror measures and [[DMCA takedown|copyright laws]] to issue takedown notices and restrict opposition speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2016/01/how-us-copyright-law-is-being-used-to-take-down-co.php|title=How U.S. copyright law is being used to take down Correa's critics in Ecuador - Committee to Protect Journalists|website=cpj.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>\n* Internet, anonymity software and [[strong cryptography]]: In addition to Internet-based publishing the Internet in combination with anonymity software such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and [[cryptography]] allows for [[Source (journalism)|sources]] to remain anonymous and sustain confidentiality while delivering information to or [[secure communication|securely communicating]] with journalists anywhere in the world in an instant (e.g. [[SecureDrop]], [[WikiLeaks]])\n* [[VOIP|Voice over Internet protocol]] (VOIP) vs. conventional [[telephony]]: Although conventional telephony systems are easily tapped and recorded, modern VOIP technology can employ low-cost strong cryptography to evade surveillance. As VOIP and similar technologies become more widespread they are likely to make the effective monitoring of journalists (and their contacts and activities) a very difficult task for governments.\n\nNaturally, governments are responding to the challenges posed by new media technologies by deploying increasingly sophisticated technology of their own (a notable example being China's attempts to impose control through a state-run [[internet service provider]] that controls access to the Internet) but it seems that this will become an increasingly difficult task as journalists continue to find new ways to exploit technology and stay one step ahead of the generally slower-moving government institutions that attempt to censor them.\n\nIn May 2010, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation intended to promote a free press around the world, a bipartisan measure inspired by the murder in [[Pakistan]] of [[Daniel Pearl]], the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter, shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The legislation, called the [[Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act]], requires the [[United States Department of State]] to expand its scrutiny of news media restrictions and intimidation as part of its annual review of [[human rights]] in each country.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |title=U.S. to Promote Press Freedom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/18press.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 May 2010}}</ref> In 2012 the Obama Administration collected communication records from 20 separate home and office lines for [[Associated Press]] reporters over a two-month period, possibly in an effort to curtail government leaks to the press. The surveillance caused widespread condemnation by First Amendment experts and free press advocates, and led 50 major media organizations to sign and send a letter of protest to United States attorney general [[Eric Holder]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hicken|first=Jackie|title=Journalists push back against Obama administration for seizure of Associated Press records|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865580078/Journalists-push-back-against-Obama-administration-for-seizure-of-Associated-Press-records.html?pg=all|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Deseret News|date=15 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Phone Records of Journalists Seized by U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/us/phone-records-of-journalists-of-the-associated-press-seized-by-us.html|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 May 2013|author2=Leslie Kaufman}}</ref>\n\n==Organizations for press freedom==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\n* [[Article 19]]\n* [[Canadian Journalists for Free Expression]]\n* [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]\n* [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]\n* [[Freedom House]]\n* [[Index on Censorship]]\n* [[Inter American Press Association]]\n* [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]]\n* [[International Press Institute]]\n* [[Media Legal Defence Initiative]]\n* [[OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media]]\n* [[Reporters Without Borders]]\n* [[Student Press Law Center]]\n* [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]]\n* [[World Press Freedom Committee]]\n* [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Censorship by country}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]\n* [[Chilling effect (term)]]\n* [[Declaration of Windhoek]] (1991)\n* ''[[Free Speech, \"The People's Darling Privilege\"]]''\n* [[Freedom of the Press Act (1766)]]\n* [[Freedom of the Press (report)|''Freedom of the Press'' (report)]]\n* [[Freedom of the press in the Russian Federation]]\n* [[Freedom of the press in the United States]]\n* [[Freedom of the press in Ukraine]]\n* [[Free speech in the media during the 2011 Libyan civil war]]\n* [[Gag order]]\n* [[Journalism ethics and standards]]\n* [[Journaliste en danger]]\n* [[Journalistic standards]]\n* [[List of indices of freedom]]\n* [[Media blackout]]\n* [[Media independence]]\n* [[Media transparency]]\n* [[Muckraker]]\n* [[News embargo]]\n* [[New York Press Club]]\n* [[Open court principle]]\n* [[Photography is Not a Crime]]\n* [[Prior restraint]]\n* [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]\n* [[State media]]\n* [[Transparency of media ownership in Europe]]\n* [[Tunisia Monitoring Group]]\n* [[Turkey's media purge after the failed July 2016 coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]\n* [[World Press Freedom Day]] on May 3\n* [[Press Freedom Index]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{-}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Gant | first = Scott | title = We're All Journalists Now: The Transformation of the Press and Reshaping of the Law in the Internet Age | location = New York | publisher = Free Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7432-9926-8 | url = https://archive.org/details/werealljournalis00gant }}\n* Gardner, Mary A.

He posts questions online and emails several people about smallpox and the scabs, unwittingly attracting the attention of people who want to take advantage of the disease.\n\nBefore he could attempt suicide to make sure he does not start the smallpox epidemic all over again, Mitty is kidnapped by bio-terrorists who want to use Mitty to infect the United States.
