According to military prosecutors, Morant retaliated for the death in combat of his commanding officer with a series of [[revenge killing]]s against both Boer POWs and many civilian residents of the [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\nHe was accused of the [[summary execution]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], and the slaying of four [[Afrikaner]]s and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers who had been taken prisoner at the Elim Hospital. Morant was found guilty and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].\n\nLieutenants Morant and [[Peter Handcock]] were then court-martialed for the murder of the Rev. [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]], a South African-born Minister of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]]. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims at Elim Hospital, indignantly vowed to inform Morant's commanding officer, and had been shot to death the same afternoon. Morant and Handcock were acquitted of the Heese murder, but their sentences for murdering Floris Visser and the eight victims at Elim Hospital were implemented by a [[firing squad]] from the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] on 27 February 1902.\n\nMorant and Handcock have become [[folk hero]]es in modern Australia, representing a turning point for Australians\u2019 self-determination and independence from British rule. Their court-martial and death have been the subject of books, a [[Breaker Morant (play)|stage play]] and an award-winning [[Australian New Wave]] [[Breaker Morant (film)|movie]] by director [[Bruce Beresford]].\n\nUpon its release during 1980, Beresford's movie both brought Morant's life story to a worldwide audience and \"hoisted the images of the accused officers to the level of Australian icons and martyrs.\"<ref>Charles Leach (2012), ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is Dead and Buried.

He was often described as \"well-educated\". He claimed to have been born in 1865 at [[Bideford, Devon]], England<ref name=\"H&H\">Hoofs and Horns, January 1986, ''Breaker Morant, Harry Reddel, Charlie Stewart and others'', p. 65</ref> and to be the son of Admiral Sir [[George Digby Morant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], a claim repeated as fact by later writers, although the Admiral denied it.<ref>Renar, Frank.

''Waroonga'']] at [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].\n\nAlthough Morant has often been described as an Australian, his former defence counsel, [[James Francis Thomas|Major J. F. Thomas]] later \"reacted strongly\" whenever his former client was described as such. In a letter to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' on 16 June 1923, Major Thomas wrote, \"Morant was not an Australian, he was an Englishman, who came to this country for 'colonial experience'.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 196.</ref> At the time, and until the [[Australian nationality law]] of 1948, all 'Australians' were in fact, [[British subject]]s.\n\nAfter his arrival, Murrant adopted the name Harry Harbord Morant and first settled in outback [[Queensland]]. During the next 15 years, he relocated to various places in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. He gained a reputation as a liquor-drinking, womanising \"bush\" poet and an expert horseman. He was one of the few who managed to ride the notorious buckjumper horse ''Dargin's Grey'' in a race that became a roughriding legend.<ref name=\"H&H\"/>\n\nMorant worked in a variety of occupations; he reportedly traded horses in [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]], then worked for a time for a newspaper at [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] during 1884, but there are suggestions{{Who|date=August 2009}} that he left both towns as a result of debts.

According to a 13 January 1900 report of his enlistment by ''[[The Adelaide Advertiser]]'', Morant, like all other volunteers, read and signed the following declaration:\n\n:We the undersigned, do hereby solemnly, sincerely and truly swear that we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]], her heirs and successors according to law, and that we will faithfully severally serve as members of the South Australian Volunteer Contingent enrolled for service in [[South Africa]], and we hereby severally bind ourselves from the 17th day of October 1899, until discharged to be subject to the provisions of the Army Act in force for the time being in [[British Army|Her Majesty's Army]], in like manner as if we had been severally and duly enlisted and attested for Her Majesty's Army for general service, and as if the said South Australian Volunteer Contingent formed part of Her Majesty's Army, and that we are in like manner during the same time severally to be subject to the Queen's rules and regulations, [[Articles of War#British Army|the rules and articles of war]], and to all such other rules and regulations and discipline of whatever nature or kind to which Her Majesty's Army is for the time being subject, and to all laws, rules and regulations in force within the Province of South Africa under the ''Defence Act 1895''; and also to all rules and regulations re: general orders and for any general officer commanding Her Majesty's forces in South Africa in which we may severally for the time be serving.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 203\">Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\nMorant was reportedly invited to visit the summer residence of [[South Australia]]'s governor, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]. After completing his training, he was appointed [[Lance Corporal|lance corporal]] and his [[regiment]] embarked for the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] on 26 January 1900.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29528172 |title=The Mounted Contingent |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 January 1900 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\nIn many respects, the terrain and climate of [[South Africa]] are similar to that of outback Australia, so Morant was in his element.  His superb horsemanship, expert bush skills and educated manner soon attracted the attention of his superiors. South Australian Colonel [[Joseph Maria Gordon|Joseph Gordon]] recommended him as a dispatch rider to [[Bennet Burleigh]], the [[war correspondent]] of the London ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''; the job reportedly provided Morant with ample opportunity to visit the nearby hospital and pursue dalliances with the nurses.\n\nA letter written on 23 January 1901 was sent to Admiral Sir George Morant by the [[Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel|Mount Nelson Hotel]] in [[Cape Town]] alleging that Sergeant Morant had stayed there during November 1900, while claiming to be the Admiral's son. \"The Breaker\" had further claimed to be a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and had \"left without discharging his liability\" of \u00a316/13s. The letter concluded, \"We shall esteem it a favour if you will let us know the course we had better adopt. We are adverse to taking the matter to court till we had heard from you.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 158.</ref>\n\nAccording to his co-defendant, Lieutenant [[George Witton]], Morant served with the South Australian Second Contingent for nine months, during which time he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nDuring March 1900, Sergeant Morant carried dispatches for the Flying Column to [[Prieska]], commanded by Colonel Lowe, 7th D.G., who was in the general advance to [[Bloemfontein]] and participated with the engagements of Karee Siding and Kroonstadt, and other engagements with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] until the entry into [[Pretoria]].  Morant was at the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]] and was then part of [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|General French]]'s staff, Cavalry Brigade, as war correspondent with [[Bennet Burleigh]] of the London ''Daily Telegraph''.  He accompanied that unit through [[Middelburg, Eastern Cape|Middelburg]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]] to the occupation of [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]].  At this point, he took leave and returned to England for six months. There, he befriended Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, and the two of them became engaged to a pair of sisters.\n\nCaptain Hunt, who was still \"signed on\", returned to South Africa to command the B [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of the Bushveldt [[Carbineer]]s, whereas Morant (who had intended that his military service end) followed him soon afterward not having found the forgiveness he sought in England.<ref>Citation needed !  WHAT \"forgiveness\" was that ?</ref> Originally, he returned to South Africa to accept a commission with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell's]] Transvaal Constabulary; he was convinced by Hunt to accept instead a commission with the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC).\n\nLieutenant Morant enlisted as a commissioned officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) on 1 April 1901.\n\n==The Bushveldt Carbineers==\nAfter their defeats in open battle during 1899\u20131900, the [[Boer Commando]]s began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Military campaign|campaign]] against both British and Commonwealth forces.  In response, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the British commander in South Africa, assembled and deployed a number of [[irregular military|irregular]] regiments to combat Boer [[commando]] units and protect British interests in the region. On his return from leave, Morant joined one of these irregular units, the Bushveldt Carbineers (or BVC), a 320-man regiment that had been formed and commanded during February 1901 by an Australian, Colonel Robert Lenehan.  After his friend's example, Captain Hunt joined the BVC soon after.\n\nThe regiment, based in [[Pietersburg]], {{convert|180|mi|km}} north of Pretoria, saw combat in the [[Spelonken]] region of the [[Northern Transvaal]] during 1901\u20131902.\n\nBy the summer of 1901, rumours had reached the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg \"of poor discipline, unconfirmed murders, drunkenness, and general lawlessness in the Spelonken.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 26.</ref> It was further alleged that a local woman had accused a British Army officer of [[sexual assault]]. Further investigation revealed that the alleged rapist was Captain James Robertson, the commanding officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers' A Squadron, based at Sweetwaters Farm. In response, Captain Robertson was recalled to HQ and given a choice between [[court martial]] and resigning his commission. Robertson submitted his resignation and quit the British Armed Forces.<ref>Leach (2012), page 23.</ref>\n\nIn response, Captain [[Percy Frederic Hunt]], \"an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\" was ordered to the Northern Transvaal and given command of the Bushveldt Carbineers \"B Squadron\". Before departing Pietersburg on the night of 11 July 1901, Captain Hunt successfully \"requested the transfer of certain officers and friends of his\" to his new field of command. These men included Lieutenants Morant, Charles Hannam, and Harry Picton.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Fort Edward==\nThe exact sequence and nature of the events resulting in Morant's arrest and trial are still disputed, and accounts vary considerably. While it seems certain that some members of the BVC were responsible for shooting Boer POWs and civilian noncombatants, the precise circumstances of these killings and the identities of those responsible will probably never be known for certain.  The following account is drawn mainly from the only surviving eyewitness source, and the 1907 book ''[[Scapegoats of the Empire]]'' by Lieutenant [[George Witton]],<ref>[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ViewPDF.aspx?B=8157064&D=D '''NAA: A1336, 227''': Copyright Application by George Ramsdale Whitton for ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', dated 7 August 1907, ''National Archives of Australia'', (contains photographs of each of the book's 240 pages).]</ref> one of the three Australians sentenced to death for the alleged murders and the only one to escape execution.\n\nWith Hunt now commanding the detachment at Fort Edward, discipline was immediately reimposed by Lieutenant Morant and Lieutenant Handcock, but this was resisted by some. In one incident, several members of a supply convoy commanded by Lieutenant Picton looted the rum it was carrying, resulting in their arrest for [[insubordination]] and for threatening to shoot Picton. They escaped to Pietersburg, but Captain Hunt sent a report to Colonel Lenehan, who had them detained. When the matter was brought before Colonel Hall, the commandant of Pietersburg, he ordered the offenders to be discharged from the regiment and released. In his book, Witton explicitly accused these disaffected troopers of being responsible for \"the monstrous and extravagant reports about the BVC which appeared later in the English and colonial press.\"\n\nBack at Fort Edward, the seized livestock<ref>What livestock ?</ref> were collected and given to the proper authorities and the stills<ref>What stills ?</ref> were destroyed, but according to Witton, these actions were resented by the perpetrators, and as a result Morant and Handcock were \"detested\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} by certain members of the detachment.<ref>This is a bob sequitor - it needs amplification</ref>\n\nWitton arrived at Fort Edward on 3 August with Sergeant Major Hammett and 30 men, and it was at this point that he met Morant and Handcock for the first time.\n\n==The Battle at Duivelskloof==\n===Prelude===\nAt the end of July 1901, the garrison at Fort Edward received a visit from the Reverend Fritz Reuter of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] and his family. Rev. Reuter was assigned to the Medingen Mission Station and, despite later claims by his family, he \"seems to have been an exception\" to the generally Republican sympathies \"of the Zoutpansberg German population\". In conversation with Captain Hunt, Rev. Reuter reported that Veldcornet Barend Viljoen's Commando was present at [[Duivelskloof]] and had been \"harassing local noncombatant farmers\". Rev. Reuter further alleged that his own mission station had been threatened. In response, Captain Hunt ordered a detachment under BVC Sergeant A.B.C. Cecil to protect the missionary and his family on their return journey.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nAfter Rev. Reuter's intelligence had been confirmed by a Native runner, Captain Hunt also learned that Sergeant Cecil's patrol had been ambushed near the Medingen Mission Station. In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. In addition to service personnel of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]], the patrol included Tony Schiel, a defector from the Zoutpansberg Commando and Intelligence Scout for Captain Taylor.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 38-39.</ref>\n\nIt was to be Schiel's task to command between 300 and 400 [[irregular military|irregulars]] drawn from the local [[Lobedu people]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received \"warnings and expressions of caution\" regarding \"the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night\" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Deciding to proceed anyway, Captain Hunt commanded \"his patrol into a situation that would echo through the next 100 years.\"<ref>Leach (2012), pages 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Ambush===\nAccording to the diary of BVC Trooper J.S. Silke, Rev. Reuter warned Hunt against attacking. The Viljoen farm, he explained, was built on a rocky hillside and \"was unassailable\". Furthermore, the nearby Botha farm contained more than 40 armed men who could easily intercept Hunt's line of retreat. Despite the warning and the fact that it was a bright moonlit night, Hunt chose to attack anyway.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-43.</ref>\n\nAfter planning a two-pronged attack, Captain Hunt ordered Trooper Silke to wait for a signal shot and rush the farmhouse from behind with 50 Lobedu warriors. Then, Captain Hunt approached the farmhouse via concrete steps terraced into the hillside.\n\nMeanwhile, the Viljoen Commando knew, according to Burgher Hendrik Adriaan Jacobs, that an attack was coming. Many commandos, however, were \"feverish\" from the effects of [[malaria]] and fatalistically waited for the arrival of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Jacobs later recalled how he saw Hunt's party through a window and began shooting. Possibly mistaking Jacobs's first shot for the signal, the BVC and the Lobedu also began shooting and general pandemonium ensued. In an exchange of fire, Captain Hunt was shot through the chest.  Sergeant Eland was killed attempting to go to Hunt's aid, as was at least one Lobedu warrior. On the Boer side, Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and G. Hartzenberg were killed. The dead of both sides were left behind by their retreating comrades.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-45.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWhen the surviving members of the patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter asked them about their officers and \"was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened\". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, \"My father roused on them, asking how they could leave their Captain like that.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 43.</ref>\n\nAccording to Leach, Captain Hunt's broken neck would be consistent with a fall down the concrete steps after being wounded. The mutilations found on his body were also found on the bodies of the three dead Boers. Both sides blamed the other for the disfigurement of the dead. Hendrik Jacobs, however, believed that Lobedu witch-doctors were to blame. According to historian Charles Leach, the mutilations do conform with accounts, by French anthropologist [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Junod]], of the traditional warfare practices of the Lobedu people.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 44-51.</ref>\n\nThe body of Captain Percy Hunt was buried at the Medingen Mission Station, where a cross was later installed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].  Sergeant Eland was buried at his family's homestead, the Ravenshill Farm, after a burial service was read by Rev. Reuter.\n\n==Revenge killings==\nWhen news of Hunt's death reached the fort, it had a profound effect on Morant; Witton said he became \"like a man demented\".<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400611.txt George Witton, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', Chapter IX \u2013 \"Death of Captain Hunt.--Morant's Reprisals\" (Project Gutenberg e-text edition)]</ref> Morant immediately ordered every available man out on patrol, became emotional while addressing the men, and ordered them to avenge the death of their captain and \"[[No quarter|give no quarter]]\".\n\nSignificantly, Morant did not see Hunt's body himself; according to Witton, Morant arrived about an hour after the burial. He questioned the men about Hunt's death and, convinced that his friend had been murdered in cold blood, he again vowed to give no quarter and take no prisoners.  Witton recounted that Morant then declared that he had, on occasion, ignored Hunt's order to this effect in the past, but that he would carry it out in the future.\n\n===Retaliation===\nThe next day, after leaving a few men to guard the mission (which the Boers threatened to burn in reprisal for harbouring the British), Morant commanded his unit back to the Viljoen farm.  It had been abandoned, so they tracked the retreating Boers all day, sighting them just at dusk. As the Australians closed in, the emotional Morant began shooting too early and they lost the element of surprise, so most of the Boers escaped. They did, however, capture one commando named Visser, wounded in the ankles so that he could not walk.\n\nThe next morning, as Morant and his men continued their pursuit, a native runner brought a message that the lightly-manned Fort Edward was in danger of being attacked by the Boers, so Morant decided to abandon the chase.\n\nAt this time, he searched and questioned Visser and found items of British uniform, including a pair of trousers which he believed was Hunt's, but which was later proved to be of much older origin. Morant then told Witton and others that he would have Visser shot at the first opportunity. When they stopped to eat around 11&nbsp;a.m., Morant again told Witton that he intended to have Visser shot, quoting orders \"direct from headquarters\" and citing Kitchener's recent alleged \"no prisoners\" proclamation. He called for a firing party, and although some of the men initially objected, Visser was made to sit down on an embankment (he could not stand), and was shot. After being shot, Visser was still alive, and Morant ordered Picton to administer a [[coup-de-grace]] with pistol shots to the head.\n\nOn the return journey to the fort, Morant's unit stopped for the night at the store of a British trader, a Mr Hays, who was well known for his hospitality.  After they left, Hays was raided by a party of Boers who looted everything he owned.  When Morant and his men arrived back at Fort Edward, they learned that a convoy under Lieutenant Neel had arrived from Pietersburg the previous day, just in time to reinforce Captain Taylor against a strong Boer force that attacked the fort. During the encounter, one Carbineer was wounded and several horses were shot. It was at this time that Taylor had a native shot, for refusing to give him information about the Boers' movements. Neel and Picton then returned to Pietersburg. <!-- what happened here?! -->\n\nOther killings followed. On 23 August, Morant commanded a small patrol to intercept a group of eight prisoners from Viljoen's commandos who were being brought in as prisoners; Morant ordered them to be taken to the side of the road and summarily shot. The South African born German missionary Reverend Predikant C.H.D. Heese spoke to the prisoners prior to the shooting.\n\nAbout a week later, reports began to circulate that Reverend Heese had been found shot along the Pietersburg road about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the fort on his way to Pietersburg to report the activities of Morant and his group to the British authorities. Soon afterwards, acting on a report that three armed Boer commandos were travelling to the fort, Morant took Handcock and several other men to intercept them. After the Boers surrendered with a white flag, they were taken prisoner, disarmed and shot.\n\nLater the same day, Major Lenehan arrived at Fort Edward for a rare visit. Morant persuaded Lenehan to let him command a strong patrol out to search for a small Boer unit commanded by [[Field Cornet|Field-cornet]] Kelly, an Irish-Boer commando whose farm was in the district. Kelly had fought against the British in the main actions of the war, and after returning to his home he had become a commando rather than surrender.\n\nMorant's patrol left Fort Edward on 16 September 1901 with orders from Lenehan that Kelly and his men were to be captured and brought back alive if possible. Covering {{convert|130|mi|km}} in a week of hard riding, they left their horses {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Kelly's [[laager]] and went the rest of the way on foot.  During the early hours of the next morning, Morant's patrol charged the laager, this time taking the Boers completely by surprise; Morant himself arrested Kelly at gunpoint at the door of his tent.  A week later, they returned to Fort Edward with the Kelly party and then escorted them safely to Pietersburg. The British commandant, Colonel Hall, sent Morant a message congratulating him on the success of his mission, after which Morant took two weeks' leave.\n\n==The letter==\nOn 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was dispatched secretly to Col.

The shooting of six surrendered [[Afrikaner people|Afrikaner]] men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at [[Valdezia]] on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred Taylor]] and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been done by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 17-22, 99.</ref>\n\n:2. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. [[Peter Handcock]] on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had \"disapproved\" of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims' wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 22-23, 99.</ref>\n\n:3. The [[revenge killing]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt Morant had ordered his men to form a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] was delivered by BVC Lt Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at [[Duivelskloof]] on 6 August 1901.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 35-60, 100.</ref>\n\n:4. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. [[George Witton]], Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath. Although Trooper Cochrane's letter made no mention of the fact, three Native South African witnesses were also shot dead.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 61-72, 100.</ref>\n\n:The ambush and fatal shooting of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]] of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] near Bandolierkop on the afternoon of 23 August 1901. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims that morning and had angrily protested to Lt Morant at Fort Edward upon learning of their deaths. Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev. Heese's driver, a member of the [[Southern Ndebele people]], was also killed.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 62-68, 73-82, 100.</ref>\n\n:5. The orders, given by BVC Lt Charles H.G. Hannam, to shoot at a wagon train containing Afrikaner women and children who were coming in to surrender at Fort Edward, on 5 September 1901. The ensuing gunfire caused the deaths of two boys, aged five and 13 years, and the wounding of a 9-year-old girl.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 83-86, 100.</ref>\n\n:6. The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901. All were coming in to surrender in the hope of gaining medical treatment for teenaged Christiaan, who was suffering from recurring bouts of fever. Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 87-90, 100-101.</ref>\n\nThe letter then accused the [[Field Commander]] of the BVC, Major Robert Lenahan, of being \"privy to these misdeamenours. It is for this reason that we have taken the liberty of addressing this communication direct to you.\" After listing numerous civilian witnesses who could confirm their allegations, Trooper Cochrane concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from Colenso till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps.

The President of the Court was Col. H.M. Carter, who was assisted by Captain E. Evans and Major Wilfred N. Bolton, the [[Provost Marshal]] of Pietersburg. The first session of the Court occurred on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for further two weeks,<ref>Leach (2012), page 105.</ref> at which time it became known that the indictments would be as follows:\n\n:1.

St. Claire wrote, \"I agree generally with the  views expressed by the Court of Inquiry in the opinions of the several cases. The idea that no prisoners were to be taken in the Spelonken area appears to have been started by the late Captain Hunt & after his death continued by orders given personally by Captain Taylor.\n\n\"The statement that Captain Hunt's body had been maltreated is in no way corroborated & the reprisals undertaken by Lt Morant on this idea were utterly unjustifiable.\n\n\"Lieut Morant seems to have been the primary mover in carrying out these orders, & Lieut Handcock willingly lent himself out as the principle executioner of them.\n\n\"Lieut Morant acquiesced in the illegal execution of the wounded Boer Visser & took a personal part in the massacre of the 8 surrendered Boers on 23 August.\n\n\"The two N.C.O.s acted under orders but were not justified in obeying illegal commands. After the murder of Van Buuren the officers seem to have exercised a reign of terror in the District, which hindered their men from reporting their illegal acts & even prevented their objecting to assist in the crime.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 125\"/>\n\n==Court-martial==\n{{main|Court martial of Breaker Morant}}\n\nThe court-martial of Morant and his co-accused began on 16 January 1902 and was conducted in several stages. Two main hearings were conducted at Pietersburg in relatively relaxed conditions; one concerned the shooting of Visser, the other the \"Eight Boers\" case. A large number of depositions by members of the BVC were made, giving damning evidence against the accused. For example, a Trooper Thompson stated that, on the morning of the 23rd (1901), he saw a party of soldiers with eight Boers: \"Morant gave orders, and the prisoners were taken off the road and shot, Handcock killing two with his revolver. Morant later told me that we had to play into his hands, or else they would know what to expect.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} A Corporal Sharp said that he \"would walk 100 miles barefoot to serve in a firing squad to shoot Morant and Handcock.\"\n\nSoon after the second hearing, the prisoners were put in irons, taken to [[Pretoria]] while heavily guarded, and tried on the third main count, that of killing Reverend Heese. Although acquitted of killing Reverend Heese, Morant and his co-accused were quickly sentenced to death on the other two charges. Morant and Handcock were shot within days of sentencing, while Witton's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Lord Kitchener. Kitchener personally signed Morant and Handcock's [[execution warrant|death warrant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Field Marshal was absent on tour when the executions occurred.\n\n==Execution==\nDuring the day of 26 February, Morant and Handcock were visited by a distraught Major Thomas; Witton says that news of the impending execution had \"almost driven him crazy\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} Thomas then rushed away to find Kitchener and plead with him, but was informed by Colonel Kelly that the Commander-in-Chief was away and was not expected back for several days. Thomas pleaded with Kelly to have the executions stayed for a few days until he could appeal to the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King]], but was told that the sentences had already been referred to England \u2014 and confirmed \u2014 and that there was \"not the slightest hope\" of a reprieve; Morant and Handcock \"must pay for what he did\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to see a clergyman, Morant replied indignantly, \"No! I'm a [[Paganism|Pagan]]!\"<ref>Witton, Ch. XX \u2013 \"Execution of Morant and Handcock\"</ref>  On hearing this, Handcock asked, \"What's a Pagan?\" and after hearing the explanation, declared \"I'm a Pagan too!\" As the afternoon wore on, all the prisoners could clearly hear the sound of coffins being built in the nearby workshop. At 16:00 hours, Witton was told he would be leaving for England at five o'clock the next morning.\n\nThat night, Morant, Picton, Handcock and Witton had a last supper together; at Morant's request, he and Handcock were allowed to spend their last night in the same cell. Morant spent most of the night writing and then penned a final sardonic verse, and a confession which read\n\n:To the Rev.

The Australian government and Lieutenant Handcock's wife, who lived in Bathurst with their three children, learned of Handcock and Morant's deaths from the Australian newspapers weeks after their executions. After learning of his sentence, Lieutenant Witton arranged to send two telegrams, one to the Australian government representative in [[Pretoria]] and the other to a relative in Victoria, but despite assurances from the British, neither telegram was ever received.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Federation_of_Australia|newly federated Australian government]] demanded an explanation from Kitchener who, on 5 April 1902, sent a telegram to the Australian Governor-General, which was published in its entirety in the Australian press. It reads as follows:<ref name=argussenthome>{{Cite news | newspaper = The Argus | date = 7 April 1902 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9634927 | page = 5 | title = THE COURT-MARTIALLED AUSTRALIANS|via=nla.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n:In reply to your telegram, Morant, Handcock and Witton were charged with twenty separate murders, including one of a German missionary who had witnessed other murders. Twelve of these murders were proved. From the evidence it appears that Morant was the originator of these crimes which Handcock carried out in cold-blooded manner. The murders were committed in the wildest parts of the Transvaal, known as Spelonken, about eighty miles north of Pretoria, on four separate dates namely July 2, August 11, August 23, and September 7. In one case, where eight Boer prisoners were murdered, it was alleged to have been done in a spirit of revenge for the ill treatment of one of their officers \u2013 Captain Hunt \u2013 who was killed in action. No such ill-treatment was proved. The prisoners were convicted after a most exhaustive trial, and were defended by counsel. There were, in my opinion, no extenuating circumstances. Lieutenant Witton was also convicted but I commuted the sentence to penal servitude for life, in consideration of his having been under the influence of Morant and Handcock. The proceedings have been sent home.\n\nNews of the executions excited considerable public interest in the UK and a summary of the trial was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 18 April 1902, but the British government announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that, in keeping with normal practice, the court-martial proceedings would not be made public. During 1981, South African historian Dr. C.A.R. Schulenburg wrote to the [[Public Record Office]] and was informed by letter that the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, had \"been destroyed under statute\" by the [[British civil service]] between 1923 and 1958.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\"/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.\n\nGeorge Witton was transported to naval detention quarters in England and then to [[Lewes]] prison in [[Sussex]]. Some time later, he was transferred to the prison at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Dorset]], and was released after serving twenty-eight months. His release was notified to the British House of Commons on 10 August 1904.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/aug/10/ex-lieutenant-wittons-release#S4V0140P0_19040810_HOC_63 Hansard], HC 4ser vol 140 col 19.</ref> On his release he returned to Australia and for a while lived in [[Lancefield, Victoria]], where he wrote his controversial book about the Morant case.

There are facts intermingled with fiction.\n\nThe most important primary source, the official record of the court-martial, vanished after the trial, and its location remains a mystery. A report on the case from Kitchener to the Australian Governor-General (published in the Australian press on 7 April 1902) quotes Kitchener as saying that \"the proceedings have been sent home\" [i.e. to England].<ref name=argussenthome /> Whatever their actual fate, the transcripts have not been seen since the trial and evidently not even the Australian government was granted access to them.\n\nIn the 'Afterword' to the 1982 reprint of Witton's book, G.A. Embleton states that{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\n:...the British authorities have been approached by many researchers eager to examine the transcripts thought to be held by the War Office. Invariably these requests have been met with denials that the documents exist or pronouncements to the effect that they cannot be released until the year 2002 ... It now appears that the papers never reached England ... (it was) recently announced that the court-martial papers had been discovered in South Africa...\n\nA comprehensive record of the trial of Morant and Handcock, complete with a large number of depositions by members of the BVC and other witnesses of the deeds of Morant and Handcock, appears in Arthur Davey's publication ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'' ([[Van Riebeeck Society]], Cape Town 1987).\n\nDuring 2012, South African historian Charles Leach published the book ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is DEAD and BURIED: A South African version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 \u2013 April 1902''. Based upon extensive research, Leach had complete access to unpublished South African sources and the papers of the Viljoen and Heese families.\n\nJoe West, a British Bushveldt Carbineers researcher, wrote in response: \"Charles Leach's impressive research has revealed that the crimes of Morant and his associates were worse than originally thought. In today's day and age Morant and Handcock plus several others would be arraigned before a War Crime Tribunal.\"\n\n===Primary sources===\n\nIn the absence of the original trial records, three primary sources remain. The first is the report of the trial printed in ''The Times'' during April 1902; the second is George Witton's account of the events of 1901\u201302, contained in his book ''Scapegoats of the Empire''. The third is a letter about the case, written by Witton to Major Thomas during 1929, which was kept secret at Witton's request until 1970. In it, Witton suggests that although Handcock confessed to the crimes, he did so under duress.\n\nMore recently, a diary written by [[Robert Poore]], the Provost Marshall at the time, was unearthed with a record for 7 October 1901. It reads:\n\n{{Quote|text=The Bushveldt Carbineers accepted the surrender of 8 Boers and after taking them along for some time shot them.

(Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) Cutlack's story, said Wilcox, was based on Witton's ''Scapegoats'' and Frank Fox's ''Breaker Morant''.\n\nThe 1976 book ''The Australians At The Boer War'' by Australian writer R.L. Wallace gives a concise and reasonably detailed account of Morant's military career, trial and execution although it contains almost no information about Morant's earlier life and omits a number of significant details contained in Witton's account of the events resulting in Morant's trial. However, Wallace was writing an overall account of the Australians' role in South Africa, not the life of Morant, Handcock or Witton.\n\nThe most widely known book is the best-selling Australian novel ''The Breaker'' by [[Kit Denton]], first published in 1973 and inspired by Denton's meeting and conversation with a Boer War veteran who had known Morant. Wilcox suggested this book is a follow-on from Cutlack's book and helped establish the myth. (Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) However, Denton claimed that Morant and Handcock were executed in Pietersburg and buried near that spot. This mistake appeared in his book as late as 1981 (7th edition, p.&nbsp;268), and is a possible reason as to why there is confusion about the location of the execution, i.e., Pretoria or Pietersburg.\n\n[[Kenneth G. Ross|Kenneth Ross]]'s 1978 successful and widely acclaimed play ''[[Breaker Morant (play)|Breaker Morant: A Play in Two Acts]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7267-0997-2}}), was adapted by Ross and [[Bruce Beresford]] into Beresford's 1980 movie ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. The movie was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay#1980s|1980 Academy Award for a screenplay adapted from another source]].\n\nDuring 1988 in the small town of Burra, South Australia, where Bruce Beresford's movie ''Breaker Morant'' was filmed, David Jennings organized a 'Retrial of Morant, Handcock and Witton'. The townsfolk staged the retrial and generated the imagination of people from all over the world. Much archival material which had been gathering dust in attics was submitted. Although the three Justices of the Peace who presided over the 'Retrial' found all three not guilty on the balance of probabilities that Kitchener had issued the orders to execute Boers in khaki, only a diary extract from a deceased Australian Staff Officer on Kitchener's staff indicated that he had verbally instructed Captain Hunt and the Bushveldt Carbineers to execute prisoners, especially those wearing khaki.\n\n===Legacy===\n\nAlthough it is generally accepted that Morant and/or others in his regiment were responsible for the deaths of a number of Boer commandos, historical opinion is still divided over the main questions of the case \u2014 how many Boers were killed, by whom were they killed, and on whose orders? In his book, ''Born to Fight'', Neil Speed has photos of a number of Canadian Scouts wearing black feathers (pp.&nbsp;105 & 119.), a symbol that they would shoot any armed Boer they captured.\n\nMorant's devotees, however, argue that he and Handcock were unfairly singled out for punishment even though many other British soldiers were known to have committed summary executions of Boer prisoners. In their opinion, the two Australians were made scapegoats by the British, who were intent on concealing the existence of the \"take no prisoners\" policy against Boer insurgents \u2014 a policy which, they claim, had been promulgated by Kitchener himself.\n\nHowever, Hamish Paterson, a South African military historian and a member of the Military History Society, has emphasised that the Bushveldt Carbineers were a British Imperial unit, not an Australian one: technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers.\n\nA 2002 book by Nick Bleszynski, ''Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant'', promoted the \"scapegoat\" argument.<ref>Bleszynski, Nick (2002), ''<nowiki>'Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant</nowiki>''.

(Novel)</ref> It said that while Morant and the others probably committed some crimes and may well have deserved disciplinary action, there is now persuasive evidence from several sources to show that the Kitchener 'no prisoners' order did indeed exist, that it was widely known among both the British and Australian troops and was performed by many disparate units. It also asserted that the court-martial's procedures were flawed.\n\nThe graves of Morant and Handcock were left unattended for many years, but after the release of Beresford's movie it became a popular place of pilgrimage for Australian tourists.  During June 1998, the Australian Government spent $1,500 refurbishing the gravesite with a new concrete slab. The marble cross which stood over the grave had been vandalised, as had many other gravestones nearby.\n\nA series of monuments now mark the locations of some of the incidents, including that of the night attack, and the site of the mass grave of eight burghers.<ref name=zoutnet>{{cite news|last1=van der Westhuizen |first1=Linda |title=Monument honours those who died |url=http://www.zoutnet.co.za/articles/news/11614/2012-01-27/monument-honours-those-who-died |accessdate=28 September 2015 |website=www.zoutnet.co.za|agency=Zoutnet |date=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Petition==\n{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}\n\nDuring 2002, a group of Australians travelled to South Africa and held a service at the Pretoria graveside to commemorate the execution on the morning of its hundredth anniversary.  The service was also attended by the Australian [[High Commissioner]] to South Africa.  The group left a new marker on the grave.\n\nA petition to pardon Morant and Handcock was sent to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during February 2010.  The petition has been severely criticised in South Africa, specifically by descendants of the Viljoen brothers who were killed in the skirmish with Hunt and Eland and by the descendants of the family of Rev. Heese.\n\nHamish Paterson states:  \"I don\u2019t think they [the Australian supporters of a Morant pardon] have actually considered what Morant was convicted of. Let's start off with the laws of war. If for example, we have a surrender. You want to surrender and I don\u2019t accept your surrender, so I choose not to accept it, that I\u2019m entitled to do. [...] However, the situation changes dramatically once I accept your surrender, then I must remove you from the battlefield to a POW camp and keep you safe. If, for example, Kitchener said, \"take no prisoners\", that was very different from \"shoot prisoners!\" So Morant and Handcock made two very basic errors: Once you\u2019ve accepted the surrender, you take them to the railway line and get them shipped off to Bermuda, or wherever. At that point, the sensible thing to do was to ship them off to a POW camp. The next error was to shoot these guys in front of a neutral witness, and then you kill the witness. These are a series of terrible errors of judgement. Because they killed a German missionary, the Kaiser (became) involved. [...] Technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers. The problem was you were dealing with an unstable set-up in the BVC . It had just been formed. I don\u2019t see a regular Australian unit behaving that way. I rather suspect why no British guys were shot was that they were either regular army or militia, or yeomanry, all of which are very unlikely to actually shoot prisoners. I think no British were shot because they hadn\u2019t made the mistake of shooting prisoners who\u2019d already surrendered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/287483|title=South African Historian Against Royal Pardon For \u2018Breaker\u2019 Morant|author=Szabo, Christopher|website=www.digitaljournal.com|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref>\n\nJim Unkles, an Australian lawyer, submitted two petitions during October 2009, one to Queen Elizabeth II and the other to the House of Representatives Petitions Committee, to review the convictions and sentences of Morant, Handcock, and Witton.

Although its provenance is obscure (Thomas died on 11 November, 1942) it is believed that the bag had originally come from the former home of James Thomas, the Tenterfield solicitor who defended Morant and his colleagues at their court martial. The items found included a number of personal effects engraved with Morant's name and/or his initials, including a penny on a leather thong, engraved with his name, which has a roughly circular nick on the edge. Although it cannot be confirmed, it is speculated that Morant was wearing the penny (an early form of 'dog tag') at the moment he was shot and that the nick was caused by the passage of one of the bullets that killed him. Other Morant effects contained in the bag included fragments of a trumpet, a bayonet scabbard, a bandolier (believed to be the one Morant wore in his famous photo portrait), a cigarette case (thought to be the one Morant gave to Thomas just before he was shot), brass drinking cups engraved with the initials HM, army field mess equipment, and a Boer War medal. The cache also included an Australian red ensign which is thought to be the same flag that is seen draping Morant and Handcock's grave in the famous photograph of Thomas standing by the burial plot. The ensign had been signed by Thomas in ink on one of the white stars and has the following inscription:\n\n\"This flag bore witness [to] utter scapegoats of the Empire Feb 27 1902 Pretoria.\"\n\n\"Signed J F Thomas.\"\n\n\"Handcock Feb 17 1868 Feb 27 1902 RIP.\"\n\n\"Lt Henry H Morant Dec 9 1864 Feb 27 1902 Pretoria RIP.\"\n\nThe bag also contained newspaper clippings and books and papers pertaining to [[Sir Henry Parkes]] and the Australian Federation process. Unfortunately, a significant quantity of badly damaged documents found in the bag were discarded by the anonymous finder before he realised the significance of the trove. The anonymous finder \u2013 known only as \"Mr Collector\" \u2013 subsequently donated the items to Tenterfield's Henry Parkes School of Arts museum, where they are now on public display.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/breaker-morant-relics-found-on-rubbish-tip-20160422-gocn1a.html|title=Breaker Morant relics found on rubbish tip|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=22 April 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Horse Memorial]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=Davey| first=Arthur| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18997618| title=Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers| publication-date=1987| publisher=Van Riebeeck Society| isbn=978-0-620-12485-0}}\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=George| first=Dave C| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9581857| title=Carvings from the Veldt : a pictorial history of rifle stock art from the Anglo Boer War 1899-1902| publication-date=2004 | publisher=Dave C.

According to military prosecutors, Morant retaliated for the death in combat of his commanding officer with a series of [[revenge killing]]s against both Boer POWs and many civilian residents of the [[Northern Transvaal]].\n\nHe was accused of the [[summary execution]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], and the slaying of four [[Afrikaner]]s and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers who had been taken prisoner at the Elim Hospital. Morant was found guilty and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].\n\nLieutenants Morant and [[Peter Handcock]] were then court-martialed for the murder of the Rev. [[Daniel Heese|Carl August Daniel Heese]], a South African-born Minister of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]]. Rev. Heese had spiritually counseled the Dutch and Afrikaner victims at Elim Hospital, indignantly vowed to inform Morant's commanding officer, and had been shot to death the same afternoon.

''Waroonga'']] at [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].\n\nAlthough Morant has often been described as an Australian, his former defence counsel, [[James Francis Thomas|Major J. F. Thomas]] later \"reacted strongly\" whenever his former client was described as such. In a letter to ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' on 16 June 1923, Major Thomas wrote, \"Morant was not an Australian, he was an Englishman, who came to this country for 'colonial experience'.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 196.</ref> At the time, and until the [[Australian nationality law]] of 1948, all 'Australians' were in fact, [[British subject]]s.\n\nAfter his arrival, Murrant adopted the name Harry Harbord Morant and first settled in outback [[Queensland]]. During the next 15 years, he relocated to various places in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. He gained a reputation as a liquor-drinking, womanising \"bush\" poet and an expert horseman.

According to a 13 January 1900 report of his enlistment by ''[[The Adelaide Advertiser]]'', Morant, like all other volunteers, read and signed the following declaration:\n\n:We the undersigned, do hereby solemnly, sincerely and truly swear that we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Queen Victoria]], her heirs and successors according to law, and that we will faithfully severally serve as members of the South Australian Volunteer Contingent enrolled for service in [[South Africa]], and we hereby severally bind ourselves from the 17th day of October 1899, until discharged to be subject to the provisions of the Army Act in force for the time being in [[British Army|Her Majesty's Army]], in like manner as if we had been severally and duly enlisted and attested for Her Majesty's Army for general service, and as if the said South Australian Volunteer Contingent formed part of Her Majesty's Army, and that we are in like manner during the same time severally to be subject to the Queen's rules and regulations, [[Articles of War#British Army|the rules and articles of war]], and to all such other rules and regulations and discipline of whatever nature or kind to which Her Majesty's Army is for the time being subject, and to all laws, rules and regulations in force within the Province of South Africa under the ''Defence Act 1895''; and also to all rules and regulations re: general orders and for any general officer commanding Her Majesty's forces in South Africa in which we may severally for the time be serving.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 203\">Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\nMorant was reportedly invited to visit the summer residence of [[South Australia]]'s governor, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]. After completing his training, he was appointed [[Lance Corporal|lance corporal]] and his [[regiment]] embarked for the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] on 26 January 1900.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29528172 |title=The Mounted Contingent |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=26 January 1900 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==South Africa==\nIn many respects, the terrain and climate of [[South Africa]] are similar to that of outback Australia, so Morant was in his element.  His superb horsemanship, expert bush skills and educated manner soon attracted the attention of his superiors. South Australian Colonel [[Joseph Maria Gordon|Joseph Gordon]] recommended him as a dispatch rider to [[Bennet Burleigh]], the [[war correspondent]] of the London ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''; the job reportedly provided Morant with ample opportunity to visit the nearby hospital and pursue dalliances with the nurses.\n\nA letter written on 23 January 1901 was sent to Admiral Sir George Morant by the [[Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel|Mount Nelson Hotel]] in [[Cape Town]] alleging that Sergeant Morant had stayed there during November 1900, while claiming to be the Admiral's son. \"The Breaker\" had further claimed to be a [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and had \"left without discharging his liability\" of \u00a316/13s. The letter concluded, \"We shall esteem it a favour if you will let us know the course we had better adopt. We are adverse to taking the matter to court till we had heard from you.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 158.</ref>\n\nAccording to his co-defendant, Lieutenant [[George Witton]], Morant served with the South Australian Second Contingent for nine months, during which time he was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\n\nDuring March 1900, Sergeant Morant carried dispatches for the Flying Column to [[Prieska]], commanded by Colonel Lowe, 7th D.G., who was in the general advance to [[Bloemfontein]] and participated with the engagements of Karee Siding and Kroonstadt, and other engagements with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] until the entry into [[Pretoria]].  Morant was at the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]] and was then part of [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|General French]]'s staff, Cavalry Brigade, as war correspondent with [[Bennet Burleigh]] of the London ''Daily Telegraph''.  He accompanied that unit through [[Middelburg, Eastern Cape|Middelburg]] and [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]] to the occupation of [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]].  At this point, he took leave and returned to England for six months. There, he befriended Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, and the two of them became engaged to a pair of sisters.\n\nCaptain Hunt, who was still \"signed on\", returned to South Africa to command the B [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of the Bushveldt [[Carbineer]]s, whereas Morant (who had intended that his military service end) followed him soon afterward not having found the forgiveness he sought in England.<ref>Citation needed !  WHAT \"forgiveness\" was that ?</ref> Originally, he returned to South Africa to accept a commission with [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell's]] Transvaal Constabulary; he was convinced by Hunt to accept instead a commission with the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC).\n\nLieutenant Morant enlisted as a commissioned officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) on 1 April 1901.\n\n==The Bushveldt Carbineers==\nAfter their defeats in open battle during 1899\u20131900, the [[Boer Commando]]s began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] [[Military campaign|campaign]] against both British and Commonwealth forces.  In response, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the British commander in South Africa, assembled and deployed a number of [[irregular military|irregular]] regiments to combat Boer [[commando]] units and protect British interests in the region. On his return from leave, Morant joined one of these irregular units, the Bushveldt Carbineers (or BVC), a 320-man regiment that had been formed and commanded during February 1901 by an Australian, Colonel Robert Lenehan.  After his friend's example, Captain Hunt joined the BVC soon after.\n\nThe regiment, based in [[Pietersburg]], {{convert|180|mi|km}} north of Pretoria, saw combat in the [[Spelonken]] region of the [[Northern Transvaal]] during 1901\u20131902.\n\nBy the summer of 1901, rumours had reached the Officer Commanding at Pietersburg \"of poor discipline, unconfirmed murders, drunkenness, and general lawlessness in the Spelonken.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 26.</ref> It was further alleged that a local woman had accused a British Army officer of [[sexual assault]]. Further investigation revealed that the alleged rapist was Captain James Robertson, the commanding officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers' A Squadron, based at Sweetwaters Farm. In response, Captain Robertson was recalled to HQ and given a choice between [[court martial]] and resigning his commission. Robertson submitted his resignation and quit the British Armed Forces.<ref>Leach (2012), page 23.</ref>\n\nIn response, Captain [[Percy Frederic Hunt]], \"an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\" was ordered to the Northern Transvaal and given command of the Bushveldt Carbineers \"B Squadron\". Before departing Pietersburg on the night of 11 July 1901, Captain Hunt successfully \"requested the transfer of certain officers and friends of his\" to his new field of command. These men included Lieutenants Morant, Charles Hannam, and Harry Picton.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27-28.</ref>\n\n==Fort Edward==\nThe exact sequence and nature of the events resulting in Morant's arrest and trial are still disputed, and accounts vary considerably. While it seems certain that some members of the BVC were responsible for shooting Boer POWs and civilian noncombatants, the precise circumstances of these killings and the identities of those responsible will probably never be known for certain.  The following account is drawn mainly from the only surviving eyewitness source, and the 1907 book ''[[Scapegoats of the Empire]]'' by Lieutenant [[George Witton]],<ref>[https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/NAAMedia/ViewPDF.aspx?B=8157064&D=D '''NAA: A1336, 227''': Copyright Application by George Ramsdale Whitton for ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', dated 7 August 1907, ''National Archives of Australia'', (contains photographs of each of the book's 240 pages).]</ref> one of the three Australians sentenced to death for the alleged murders and the only one to escape execution.\n\nWith Hunt now commanding the detachment at Fort Edward, discipline was immediately reimposed by Lieutenant Morant and Lieutenant Handcock, but this was resisted by some. In one incident, several members of a supply convoy commanded by Lieutenant Picton looted the rum it was carrying, resulting in their arrest for [[insubordination]] and for threatening to shoot Picton. They escaped to Pietersburg, but Captain Hunt sent a report to Colonel Lenehan, who had them detained. When the matter was brought before Colonel Hall, the commandant of Pietersburg, he ordered the offenders to be discharged from the regiment and released. In his book, Witton explicitly accused these disaffected troopers of being responsible for \"the monstrous and extravagant reports about the BVC which appeared later in the English and colonial press.\"\n\nBack at Fort Edward, the seized livestock<ref>What livestock ?</ref> were collected and given to the proper authorities and the stills<ref>What stills ?</ref> were destroyed, but according to Witton, these actions were resented by the perpetrators, and as a result Morant and Handcock were \"detested\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} by certain members of the detachment.<ref>This is a bob sequitor - it needs amplification</ref>\n\nWitton arrived at Fort Edward on 3 August with Sergeant Major Hammett and 30 men, and it was at this point that he met Morant and Handcock for the first time.\n\n==The Battle at Duivelskloof==\n===Prelude===\nAt the end of July 1901, the garrison at Fort Edward received a visit from the Reverend Fritz Reuter of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]] and his family. Rev. Reuter was assigned to the Medingen Mission Station and, despite later claims by his family, he \"seems to have been an exception\" to the generally Republican sympathies \"of the Zoutpansberg German population\". In conversation with Captain Hunt, Rev. Reuter reported that Veldcornet Barend Viljoen's Commando was present at [[Duivelskloof]] and had been \"harassing local noncombatant farmers\". Rev. Reuter further alleged that his own mission station had been threatened. In response, Captain Hunt ordered a detachment under BVC Sergeant A.B.C. Cecil to protect the missionary and his family on their return journey.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 37-38.</ref>\n\nAfter Rev. Reuter's intelligence had been confirmed by a Native runner, Captain Hunt also learned that Sergeant Cecil's patrol had been ambushed near the Medingen Mission Station. In response, the captain departed Fort Edward on 2 August 1901 with the intention of ambushing the Viljoen Commando. In addition to service personnel of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]], the patrol included Tony Schiel, a defector from the Zoutpansberg Commando and Intelligence Scout for Captain Taylor.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 38-39.</ref>\n\nIt was to be Schiel's task to command between 300 and 400 [[irregular military|irregulars]] drawn from the local [[Lobedu people]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt had received \"warnings and expressions of caution\" regarding \"the wisdom of attacking an enemy position at night\" without normal reconnaissance of the place. Deciding to proceed anyway, Captain Hunt commanded \"his patrol into a situation that would echo through the next 100 years.\"<ref>Leach (2012), pages 39-40.</ref>\n\n===Ambush===\nAccording to the diary of BVC Trooper J.S. Silke, Rev. Reuter warned Hunt against attacking. The Viljoen farm, he explained, was built on a rocky hillside and \"was unassailable\". Furthermore, the nearby Botha farm contained more than 40 armed men who could easily intercept Hunt's line of retreat. Despite the warning and the fact that it was a bright moonlit night, Hunt chose to attack anyway.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-43.</ref>\n\nAfter planning a two-pronged attack, Captain Hunt ordered Trooper Silke to wait for a signal shot and rush the farmhouse from behind with 50 Lobedu warriors. Then, Captain Hunt approached the farmhouse via concrete steps terraced into the hillside.\n\nMeanwhile, the Viljoen Commando knew, according to Burgher Hendrik Adriaan Jacobs, that an attack was coming. Many commandos, however, were \"feverish\" from the effects of [[malaria]] and fatalistically waited for the arrival of the Bushveldt Carbineers. Jacobs later recalled how he saw Hunt's party through a window and began shooting. Possibly mistaking Jacobs's first shot for the signal, the BVC and the Lobedu also began shooting and general pandemonium ensued. In an exchange of fire, Captain Hunt was shot through the chest.  Sergeant Eland was killed attempting to go to Hunt's aid, as was at least one Lobedu warrior. On the Boer side, Barend Viljoen, his brother J.J. Viljoen, and G. Hartzenberg were killed. The dead of both sides were left behind by their retreating comrades.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 40-45.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWhen the surviving members of the patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter asked them about their officers and \"was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened\". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, \"My father roused on them, asking how they could leave their Captain like that.\"<ref>Leach (2012), page 43.</ref>\n\nAccording to Leach, Captain Hunt's broken neck would be consistent with a fall down the concrete steps after being wounded. The mutilations found on his body were also found on the bodies of the three dead Boers. Both sides blamed the other for the disfigurement of the dead. Hendrik Jacobs, however, believed that Lobedu witch-doctors were to blame. According to historian Charles Leach, the mutilations do conform with accounts, by French anthropologist [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Junod]], of the traditional warfare practices of the Lobedu people.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 44-51.</ref>\n\nThe body of Captain Percy Hunt was buried at the Medingen Mission Station, where a cross was later installed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].  Sergeant Eland was buried at his family's homestead, the Ravenshill Farm, after a burial service was read by Rev. Reuter.\n\n==Revenge killings==\nWhen news of Hunt's death reached the fort, it had a profound effect on Morant; Witton said he became \"like a man demented\".<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400611.txt George Witton, ''Scapegoats of the Empire'', Chapter IX \u2013 \"Death of Captain Hunt.--Morant's Reprisals\" (Project Gutenberg e-text edition)]</ref> Morant immediately ordered every available man out on patrol, became emotional while addressing the men, and ordered them to avenge the death of their captain and \"[[No quarter|give no quarter]]\".\n\nSignificantly, Morant did not see Hunt's body himself; according to Witton, Morant arrived about an hour after the burial. He questioned the men about Hunt's death and, convinced that his friend had been murdered in cold blood, he again vowed to give no quarter and take no prisoners.  Witton recounted that Morant then declared that he had, on occasion, ignored Hunt's order to this effect in the past, but that he would carry it out in the future.\n\n===Retaliation===\nThe next day, after leaving a few men to guard the mission (which the Boers threatened to burn in reprisal for harbouring the British), Morant commanded his unit back to the Viljoen farm.  It had been abandoned, so they tracked the retreating Boers all day, sighting them just at dusk. As the Australians closed in, the emotional Morant began shooting too early and they lost the element of surprise, so most of the Boers escaped. They did, however, capture one commando named Visser, wounded in the ankles so that he could not walk.\n\nThe next morning, as Morant and his men continued their pursuit, a native runner brought a message that the lightly-manned Fort Edward was in danger of being attacked by the Boers, so Morant decided to abandon the chase.\n\nAt this time, he searched and questioned Visser and found items of British uniform, including a pair of trousers which he believed was Hunt's, but which was later proved to be of much older origin. Morant then told Witton and others that he would have Visser shot at the first opportunity. When they stopped to eat around 11&nbsp;a.m., Morant again told Witton that he intended to have Visser shot, quoting orders \"direct from headquarters\" and citing Kitchener's recent alleged \"no prisoners\" proclamation. He called for a firing party, and although some of the men initially objected, Visser was made to sit down on an embankment (he could not stand), and was shot. After being shot, Visser was still alive, and Morant ordered Picton to administer a [[coup-de-grace]] with pistol shots to the head.\n\nOn the return journey to the fort, Morant's unit stopped for the night at the store of a British trader, a Mr Hays, who was well known for his hospitality.  After they left, Hays was raided by a party of Boers who looted everything he owned.  When Morant and his men arrived back at Fort Edward, they learned that a convoy under Lieutenant Neel had arrived from Pietersburg the previous day, just in time to reinforce Captain Taylor against a strong Boer force that attacked the fort. During the encounter, one Carbineer was wounded and several horses were shot. It was at this time that Taylor had a native shot, for refusing to give him information about the Boers' movements. Neel and Picton then returned to Pietersburg. <!-- what happened here?! -->\n\nOther killings followed. On 23 August, Morant commanded a small patrol to intercept a group of eight prisoners from Viljoen's commandos who were being brought in as prisoners; Morant ordered them to be taken to the side of the road and summarily shot. The South African born German missionary Reverend Predikant C.H.D. Heese spoke to the prisoners prior to the shooting.\n\nAbout a week later, reports began to circulate that Reverend Heese had been found shot along the Pietersburg road about {{convert|15|mi|km}} from the fort on his way to Pietersburg to report the activities of Morant and his group to the British authorities. Soon afterwards, acting on a report that three armed Boer commandos were travelling to the fort, Morant took Handcock and several other men to intercept them. After the Boers surrendered with a white flag, they were taken prisoner, disarmed and shot.\n\nLater the same day, Major Lenehan arrived at Fort Edward for a rare visit. Morant persuaded Lenehan to let him command a strong patrol out to search for a small Boer unit commanded by [[Field Cornet|Field-cornet]] Kelly, an Irish-Boer commando whose farm was in the district. Kelly had fought against the British in the main actions of the war, and after returning to his home he had become a commando rather than surrender.\n\nMorant's patrol left Fort Edward on 16 September 1901 with orders from Lenehan that Kelly and his men were to be captured and brought back alive if possible. Covering {{convert|130|mi|km}} in a week of hard riding, they left their horses {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Kelly's [[laager]] and went the rest of the way on foot.  During the early hours of the next morning, Morant's patrol charged the laager, this time taking the Boers completely by surprise; Morant himself arrested Kelly at gunpoint at the door of his tent.  A week later, they returned to Fort Edward with the Kelly party and then escorted them safely to Pietersburg. The British commandant, Colonel Hall, sent Morant a message congratulating him on the success of his mission, after which Morant took two weeks' leave.\n\n==The letter==\nOn 4 October 1901, a letter signed by 15 members of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] (BVC) garrison at Fort Edward was dispatched secretly to Col. F.H. Hall, the British Army [[Officer Commanding]] at [[Pietersburg]]. Written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]],<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98-101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78-82.</ref> the letter accused members of the Fort Edward garrison of six \"disgraceful incidents\":\n\n:1. The shooting of six surrendered [[Afrikaner people|Afrikaner]] men and boys and the theft of their money and livestock at [[Valdezia]] on 2 July 1901. The orders had been given by Captains [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred Taylor]] and James Huntley Robertson, and relayed by Sgt. Maj. K.C.B. Morrison to Sgt. D.C. Oldham. The actual killing was alleged to have been done by Sgt. Oldham and BVC Troopers Eden, Arnold, Brown, Heath, and Dale.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 17-22, 99.</ref>\n\n:2. The shooting of BVC Trooper B.J. van Buuren by BVC Lt. [[Peter Handcock]] on 4 July 1901. Trooper van Buuren, an Afrikaner, had \"disapproved\" of the killings at Valdezia, and had informed the victims' wives and children, who were imprisoned at Fort Edward, of what had happened.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 22-23, 99.</ref>\n\n:3. The [[revenge killing]] of Floris Visser, a wounded [[prisoner of war]], near the Koedoes River on 11 August 1901. Visser had been captured by a BVC patrol led by Lieut. Morant two days before his death. After Visser had been exhaustively interrogated and conveyed for 15 miles by the patrol, Lt Morant had ordered his men to form a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. The squad consisted of BVC Troopers A.J. Petrie, J.J. Gill, Wild, and T.J. Botha. A [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] was delivered by BVC Lt Harry Picton. The slaying of Floris Visser was in retaliation for the combat death of Morant's close friend, BVC Captain Percy Frederik Hunt, at [[Duivelskloof]] on 6 August 1901.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 35-60, 100.</ref>\n\n:4. The shooting, ordered by Capt. Taylor and Lt. Morant, of four surrendered Afrikaners and four [[Dutch people|Dutch]] schoolteachers, who had been captured at the Elim Hospital in Valdezia, on the morning of 23 August 1901. The firing squad consisted of BVC Lt. [[George Witton]], Sgt. D.C. Oldham, and Troopers J.T. Arnold, Edward Brown, T. Dale, and A. Heath.

Trooper Cochrane alleged that the killer of Rev. Heese was BVC Lt Peter Handcock. Although Cochrane made no mention of the fact, Rev.

The shooting of Roelf van Staden and his sons Roelf and Christiaan, near Fort Edward on 7 September 1901.

Instead, they were met at the Sweetwaters Farm near Fort Edward by a party consisting of Lts. Morant and Handcock, joined by BVC Sgt. Maj. Hammet, Corp. MacMahon, and Troopers Hodds, Botha, and Thompson. Roelf van Staden and both his sons were then shot, allegedly after being forced to dig their own graves.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 87-90, 100-101.</ref>\n\nThe letter then accused the [[Field Commander]] of the BVC, Major Robert Lenahan, of being \"privy to these misdeamenours.

We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps.

The first session of the Court occurred on 6 November 1901 and continued for four weeks. Deliberations continued for further two weeks,<ref>Leach (2012), page 105.</ref> at which time it became known that the indictments would be as follows:\n\n:1.

St. Claire wrote, \"I agree generally with the  views expressed by the Court of Inquiry in the opinions of the several cases. The idea that no prisoners were to be taken in the Spelonken area appears to have been started by the late Captain Hunt & after his death continued by orders given personally by Captain Taylor.\n\n\"The statement that Captain Hunt's body had been maltreated is in no way corroborated & the reprisals undertaken by Lt Morant on this idea were utterly unjustifiable.\n\n\"Lieut Morant seems to have been the primary mover in carrying out these orders, & Lieut Handcock willingly lent himself out as the principle executioner of them.\n\n\"Lieut Morant acquiesced in the illegal execution of the wounded Boer Visser & took a personal part in the massacre of the 8 surrendered Boers on 23 August.\n\n\"The two N.C.O.s acted under orders but were not justified in obeying illegal commands.

Two main hearings were conducted at Pietersburg in relatively relaxed conditions; one concerned the shooting of Visser, the other the \"Eight Boers\" case. A large number of depositions by members of the BVC were made, giving damning evidence against the accused. For example, a Trooper Thompson stated that, on the morning of the 23rd (1901), he saw a party of soldiers with eight Boers: \"Morant gave orders, and the prisoners were taken off the road and shot, Handcock killing two with his revolver. Morant later told me that we had to play into his hands, or else they would know what to expect.\"{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} A Corporal Sharp said that he \"would walk 100 miles barefoot to serve in a firing squad to shoot Morant and Handcock.\"\n\nSoon after the second hearing, the prisoners were put in irons, taken to [[Pretoria]] while heavily guarded, and tried on the third main count, that of killing Reverend Heese. Although acquitted of killing Reverend Heese, Morant and his co-accused were quickly sentenced to death on the other two charges. Morant and Handcock were shot within days of sentencing, while Witton's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Lord Kitchener. Kitchener personally signed Morant and Handcock's [[execution warrant|death warrant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Field Marshal was absent on tour when the executions occurred.\n\n==Execution==\nDuring the day of 26 February, Morant and Handcock were visited by a distraught Major Thomas; Witton says that news of the impending execution had \"almost driven him crazy\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} Thomas then rushed away to find Kitchener and plead with him, but was informed by Colonel Kelly that the Commander-in-Chief was away and was not expected back for several days. Thomas pleaded with Kelly to have the executions stayed for a few days until he could appeal to the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King]], but was told that the sentences had already been referred to England \u2014 and confirmed \u2014 and that there was \"not the slightest hope\" of a reprieve; Morant and Handcock \"must pay for what he did\".{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to see a clergyman, Morant replied indignantly, \"No! I'm a [[Paganism|Pagan]]!\"<ref>Witton, Ch. XX \u2013 \"Execution of Morant and Handcock\"</ref>  On hearing this, Handcock asked, \"What's a Pagan?\" and after hearing the explanation, declared \"I'm a Pagan too!\" As the afternoon wore on, all the prisoners could clearly hear the sound of coffins being built in the nearby workshop. At 16:00 hours, Witton was told he would be leaving for England at five o'clock the next morning.\n\nThat night, Morant, Picton, Handcock and Witton had a last supper together; at Morant's request, he and Handcock were allowed to spend their last night in the same cell. Morant spent most of the night writing and then penned a final sardonic verse, and a confession which read\n\n:To the Rev.

The Australian government and Lieutenant Handcock's wife, who lived in Bathurst with their three children, learned of Handcock and Morant's deaths from the Australian newspapers weeks after their executions. After learning of his sentence, Lieutenant Witton arranged to send two telegrams, one to the Australian government representative in [[Pretoria]] and the other to a relative in Victoria, but despite assurances from the British, neither telegram was ever received.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Federation_of_Australia|newly federated Australian government]] demanded an explanation from Kitchener who, on 5 April 1902, sent a telegram to the Australian Governor-General, which was published in its entirety in the Australian press. It reads as follows:<ref name=argussenthome>{{Cite news | newspaper = The Argus | date = 7 April 1902 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9634927 | page = 5 | title = THE COURT-MARTIALLED AUSTRALIANS|via=nla.gov.au}}</ref>\n\n:In reply to your telegram, Morant, Handcock and Witton were charged with twenty separate murders, including one of a German missionary who had witnessed other murders. Twelve of these murders were proved. From the evidence it appears that Morant was the originator of these crimes which Handcock carried out in cold-blooded manner. The murders were committed in the wildest parts of the Transvaal, known as Spelonken, about eighty miles north of Pretoria, on four separate dates namely July 2, August 11, August 23, and September 7. In one case, where eight Boer prisoners were murdered, it was alleged to have been done in a spirit of revenge for the ill treatment of one of their officers \u2013 Captain Hunt \u2013 who was killed in action. No such ill-treatment was proved. The prisoners were convicted after a most exhaustive trial, and were defended by counsel. There were, in my opinion, no extenuating circumstances. Lieutenant Witton was also convicted but I commuted the sentence to penal servitude for life, in consideration of his having been under the influence of Morant and Handcock. The proceedings have been sent home.\n\nNews of the executions excited considerable public interest in the UK and a summary of the trial was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 18 April 1902, but the British government announced in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that, in keeping with normal practice, the court-martial proceedings would not be made public. During 1981, South African historian Dr. C.A.R. Schulenburg wrote to the [[Public Record Office]] and was informed by letter that the trial transcripts, like almost all others dating from between 1850 and 1914, had \"been destroyed under statute\" by the [[British civil service]] between 1923 and 1958.<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 104, 106\"/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed on 31 May 1902.\n\nGeorge Witton was transported to naval detention quarters in England and then to [[Lewes]] prison in [[Sussex]]. Some time later, he was transferred to the prison at [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Dorset]], and was released after serving twenty-eight months. His release was notified to the British House of Commons on 10 August 1904.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1904/aug/10/ex-lieutenant-wittons-release#S4V0140P0_19040810_HOC_63 Hansard], HC 4ser vol 140 col 19.</ref> On his release he returned to Australia and for a while lived in [[Lancefield, Victoria]], where he wrote his controversial book about the Morant case. He published it during 1907 with the provocative title ''[[Scapegoats of the Empire]]''.<ref name=Jooste>{{cite book|last=Jooste, Webster|first=Graham, Roger|title=Innocent Blood|year=2002|publisher=New Africa Books|page=216|isbn=978-0-86486-532-8}}</ref> The book was reprinted during 1982 following the success of the 1980 movie ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. Witton died in Australia during 1942.\n\n[[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] became a Native Commissioner in [[Rhodesia]] and died during 1941.\n\nThe Australian government was so resentful of this case that it insisted that none of its troops would be tried by the British military during World War I.<ref name=Jooste/>\n\n==Literature on Morant and conflicting theories about the case==\n\nMorant's life, exploits, trial and execution have been examined in several books and numerous press and internet articles, but as noted above, each account varies very considerably from the others in both the facts presented and their interpretation. There are facts intermingled with fiction.\n\nThe most important primary source, the official record of the court-martial, vanished after the trial, and its location remains a mystery. A report on the case from Kitchener to the Australian Governor-General (published in the Australian press on 7 April 1902) quotes Kitchener as saying that \"the proceedings have been sent home\" [i.e. to England].<ref name=argussenthome /> Whatever their actual fate, the transcripts have not been seen since the trial and evidently not even the Australian government was granted access to them.\n\nIn the 'Afterword' to the 1982 reprint of Witton's book, G.A. Embleton states that{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}}\n\n:...the British authorities have been approached by many researchers eager to examine the transcripts thought to be held by the War Office. Invariably these requests have been met with denials that the documents exist or pronouncements to the effect that they cannot be released until the year 2002 ... It now appears that the papers never reached England ... (it was) recently announced that the court-martial papers had been discovered in South Africa...\n\nA comprehensive record of the trial of Morant and Handcock, complete with a large number of depositions by members of the BVC and other witnesses of the deeds of Morant and Handcock, appears in Arthur Davey's publication ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'' ([[Van Riebeeck Society]], Cape Town 1987).\n\nDuring 2012, South African historian Charles Leach published the book ''The Legend of Breaker Morant is DEAD and BURIED: A South African version of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Zoutpansberg, May 1901 \u2013 April 1902''. Based upon extensive research, Leach had complete access to unpublished South African sources and the papers of the Viljoen and Heese families.\n\nJoe West, a British Bushveldt Carbineers researcher, wrote in response: \"Charles Leach's impressive research has revealed that the crimes of Morant and his associates were worse than originally thought. In today's day and age Morant and Handcock plus several others would be arraigned before a War Crime Tribunal.\"\n\n===Primary sources===\n\nIn the absence of the original trial records, three primary sources remain. The first is the report of the trial printed in ''The Times'' during April 1902; the second is George Witton's account of the events of 1901\u201302, contained in his book ''Scapegoats of the Empire''. The third is a letter about the case, written by Witton to Major Thomas during 1929, which was kept secret at Witton's request until 1970. In it, Witton suggests that although Handcock confessed to the crimes, he did so under duress.\n\nMore recently, a diary written by [[Robert Poore]], the Provost Marshall at the time, was unearthed with a record for 7 October 1901. It reads:\n\n{{Quote|text=The Bushveldt Carbineers accepted the surrender of 8 Boers and after taking them along for some time shot them. If they had intended doing this they should not have accepted a surrender in the first instance. A German missionary was close by and so as to prevent him saying anything they shot him too.

(Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) Cutlack's story, said Wilcox, was based on Witton's ''Scapegoats'' and Frank Fox's ''Breaker Morant''.\n\nThe 1976 book ''The Australians At The Boer War'' by Australian writer R.L. Wallace gives a concise and reasonably detailed account of Morant's military career, trial and execution although it contains almost no information about Morant's earlier life and omits a number of significant details contained in Witton's account of the events resulting in Morant's trial. However, Wallace was writing an overall account of the Australians' role in South Africa, not the life of Morant, Handcock or Witton.\n\nThe most widely known book is the best-selling Australian novel ''The Breaker'' by [[Kit Denton]], first published in 1973 and inspired by Denton's meeting and conversation with a Boer War veteran who had known Morant. Wilcox suggested this book is a follow-on from Cutlack's book and helped establish the myth. (Wilcox, p.&nbsp;363.) However, Denton claimed that Morant and Handcock were executed in Pietersburg and buried near that spot. This mistake appeared in his book as late as 1981 (7th edition, p.&nbsp;268), and is a possible reason as to why there is confusion about the location of the execution, i.e., Pretoria or Pietersburg.\n\n[[Kenneth G. Ross|Kenneth Ross]]'s 1978 successful and widely acclaimed play ''[[Breaker Morant (play)|Breaker Morant: A Play in Two Acts]]'' ({{ISBN|0-7267-0997-2}}), was adapted by Ross and [[Bruce Beresford]] into Beresford's 1980 movie ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. The movie was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay#1980s|1980 Academy Award for a screenplay adapted from another source]].\n\nDuring 1988 in the small town of Burra, South Australia, where Bruce Beresford's movie ''Breaker Morant'' was filmed, David Jennings organized a 'Retrial of Morant, Handcock and Witton'. The townsfolk staged the retrial and generated the imagination of people from all over the world. Much archival material which had been gathering dust in attics was submitted. Although the three Justices of the Peace who presided over the 'Retrial' found all three not guilty on the balance of probabilities that Kitchener had issued the orders to execute Boers in khaki, only a diary extract from a deceased Australian Staff Officer on Kitchener's staff indicated that he had verbally instructed Captain Hunt and the Bushveldt Carbineers to execute prisoners, especially those wearing khaki.\n\n===Legacy===\n\nAlthough it is generally accepted that Morant and/or others in his regiment were responsible for the deaths of a number of Boer commandos, historical opinion is still divided over the main questions of the case \u2014 how many Boers were killed, by whom were they killed, and on whose orders? In his book, ''Born to Fight'', Neil Speed has photos of a number of Canadian Scouts wearing black feathers (pp.&nbsp;105 & 119.), a symbol that they would shoot any armed Boer they captured.\n\nMorant's devotees, however, argue that he and Handcock were unfairly singled out for punishment even though many other British soldiers were known to have committed summary executions of Boer prisoners. In their opinion, the two Australians were made scapegoats by the British, who were intent on concealing the existence of the \"take no prisoners\" policy against Boer insurgents \u2014 a policy which, they claim, had been promulgated by Kitchener himself.\n\nHowever, Hamish Paterson, a South African military historian and a member of the Military History Society, has emphasised that the Bushveldt Carbineers were a British Imperial unit, not an Australian one: technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers.\n\nA 2002 book by Nick Bleszynski, ''Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant'', promoted the \"scapegoat\" argument.<ref>Bleszynski, Nick (2002), ''<nowiki>'Shoot Straight, You Bastards': The True Story Behind The Killing of 'Breaker' Morant</nowiki>''. Random House Australia. {{ISBN|1-74051-081-X}}. (Novel)</ref> It said that while Morant and the others probably committed some crimes and may well have deserved disciplinary action, there is now persuasive evidence from several sources to show that the Kitchener 'no prisoners' order did indeed exist, that it was widely known among both the British and Australian troops and was performed by many disparate units. It also asserted that the court-martial's procedures were flawed.\n\nThe graves of Morant and Handcock were left unattended for many years, but after the release of Beresford's movie it became a popular place of pilgrimage for Australian tourists.  During June 1998, the Australian Government spent $1,500 refurbishing the gravesite with a new concrete slab. The marble cross which stood over the grave had been vandalised, as had many other gravestones nearby.\n\nA series of monuments now mark the locations of some of the incidents, including that of the night attack, and the site of the mass grave of eight burghers.<ref name=zoutnet>{{cite news|last1=van der Westhuizen |first1=Linda |title=Monument honours those who died |url=http://www.zoutnet.co.za/articles/news/11614/2012-01-27/monument-honours-those-who-died |accessdate=28 September 2015 |website=www.zoutnet.co.za|agency=Zoutnet |date=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Petition==\n{{main|Pardon for Morant, Handcock and Witton}}\n\nDuring 2002, a group of Australians travelled to South Africa and held a service at the Pretoria graveside to commemorate the execution on the morning of its hundredth anniversary.  The service was also attended by the Australian [[High Commissioner]] to South Africa.  The group left a new marker on the grave.\n\nA petition to pardon Morant and Handcock was sent to [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during February 2010.  The petition has been severely criticised in South Africa, specifically by descendants of the Viljoen brothers who were killed in the skirmish with Hunt and Eland and by the descendants of the family of Rev. Heese.\n\nHamish Paterson states:  \"I don\u2019t think they [the Australian supporters of a Morant pardon] have actually considered what Morant was convicted of. Let's start off with the laws of war. If for example, we have a surrender. You want to surrender and I don\u2019t accept your surrender, so I choose not to accept it, that I\u2019m entitled to do. [...] However, the situation changes dramatically once I accept your surrender, then I must remove you from the battlefield to a POW camp and keep you safe. If, for example, Kitchener said, \"take no prisoners\", that was very different from \"shoot prisoners!\" So Morant and Handcock made two very basic errors: Once you\u2019ve accepted the surrender, you take them to the railway line and get them shipped off to Bermuda, or wherever. At that point, the sensible thing to do was to ship them off to a POW camp. The next error was to shoot these guys in front of a neutral witness, and then you kill the witness. These are a series of terrible errors of judgement. Because they killed a German missionary, the Kaiser (became) involved. [...] Technically, the two \"Aussies\" were British officers. The problem was you were dealing with an unstable set-up in the BVC . It had just been formed. I don\u2019t see a regular Australian unit behaving that way. I rather suspect why no British guys were shot was that they were either regular army or militia, or yeomanry, all of which are very unlikely to actually shoot prisoners.

Although its provenance is obscure (Thomas died on 11 November, 1942) it is believed that the bag had originally come from the former home of James Thomas, the Tenterfield solicitor who defended Morant and his colleagues at their court martial. The items found included a number of personal effects engraved with Morant's name and/or his initials, including a penny on a leather thong, engraved with his name, which has a roughly circular nick on the edge. Although it cannot be confirmed, it is speculated that Morant was wearing the penny (an early form of 'dog tag') at the moment he was shot and that the nick was caused by the passage of one of the bullets that killed him. Other Morant effects contained in the bag included fragments of a trumpet, a bayonet scabbard, a bandolier (believed to be the one Morant wore in his famous photo portrait), a cigarette case (thought to be the one Morant gave to Thomas just before he was shot), brass drinking cups engraved with the initials HM, army field mess equipment, and a Boer War medal. The cache also included an Australian red ensign which is thought to be the same flag that is seen draping Morant and Handcock's grave in the famous photograph of Thomas standing by the burial plot. The ensign had been signed by Thomas in ink on one of the white stars and has the following inscription:\n\n\"This flag bore witness [to] utter scapegoats of the Empire Feb 27 1902 Pretoria.\"\n\n\"Signed J F Thomas.\"\n\n\"Handcock Feb 17 1868 Feb 27 1902 RIP.\"\n\n\"Lt Henry H Morant Dec 9 1864 Feb 27 1902 Pretoria RIP.\"\n\nThe bag also contained newspaper clippings and books and papers pertaining to [[Sir Henry Parkes]] and the Australian Federation process. Unfortunately, a significant quantity of badly damaged documents found in the bag were discarded by the anonymous finder before he realised the significance of the trove. The anonymous finder \u2013 known only as \"Mr Collector\" \u2013 subsequently donated the items to Tenterfield's Henry Parkes School of Arts museum, where they are now on public display.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/breaker-morant-relics-found-on-rubbish-tip-20160422-gocn1a.html|title=Breaker Morant relics found on rubbish tip|first=Damien|last=Murphy|date=22 April 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Horse Memorial]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=Davey| first=Arthur| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18997618| title=Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers| publication-date=1987| publisher=Van Riebeeck Society| isbn=978-0-620-12485-0}}\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv| last=George| first=Dave C| url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9581857| title=Carvings from the Veldt : a pictorial history of rifle stock art from the Anglo Boer War 1899-1902| publication-date=2004 | publisher=Dave C.

In order to win the title, the team had to pull [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] back from an eight-point lead at the beginning of March. United also finished as runners-up in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] eventually taking the prize. The club also broke the English transfer record for the third time in just over a year as they paid \u00a329.1&nbsp;million for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] [[Defender (association football)|defender]] [[Rio Ferdinand]].\n\nAt the end of the season, United midfielder [[David Beckham]] decided to move to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in a \u00a325&nbsp;million deal, having spent 12 years at United (eight of them as a first-team regular). Meanwhile, 37-year-old centre-back [[Laurent Blanc]] announced his retirement from playing. Fellow centre-back [[David May (footballer)|David May]] was finally given a free transfer after nine years at the club, the last five of which had seen his first team opportunities limited to a handful of appearances.\n\n==Season review==\nAfter ending the [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|previous season]] by surrendering the title to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at home and finishing third behind rejuvenated [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Alex Ferguson]] reiterated his desire to dominate English football by signing a three-year contract in the late winter of 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson signs new deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1843622.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}</ref> By the end of the season, Ferguson got his wish and bagged Manchester United their fifteenth domestic league title, thanks largely to the form of striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] who scored an impressive 25 goals during the run-in.<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Nistelrooy nets Golden Boot |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3018753.stm |date=11 May 2003}}</ref> The manager also assembled a new defence which included new signing [[Rio Ferdinand]], whose deal broke the transfer record in English football and indeed, the world record for a defender.\n\nThe Red Devils started their quest to regain the Premier League title at home to newly promoted [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and claimed all three points thanks to super-sub [[Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r]]'s late goal. Results didn't flow as Ferguson hoped and as early autumn approached, Manchester United had made their worst start since the inauguration of the Premier League, lying in 10th place.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson rues poor start |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2288906.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2002 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}</ref> Things didn't get better as losses to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] were eclipsed by a derby day defeat to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in November which allowed a four-point gap to open between themselves and leaders Liverpool. Following an empathic win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], the team embarked on a run of wins that included rivals Liverpool, struggling West Ham and champions Arsenal to help their Premier League challenge gather ominous momentum. Although they slumped to defeat on Boxing Day at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], the team were in third place, five points short of table-toppers Arsenal at the turn of the year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson's best yet |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2984545.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Middlesbrough loss on 22 December turned out to be their last league defeat of the season, as a series of late home wins against Sunderland and Chelsea in January helped pile the pressure somewhat on runaway leaders Arsenal, who were struggling with a minor goalkeeping crisis. After United drew at Bolton in the late evening kick-off on 22 February, Arsenal had the chance to open a five-point gap at the Premier League summit if they won at Maine Road. A five-star performance ensured this through a rampant display of attacking football that virtually put one hand on the trophy. However the difference in the title race was  later whittled down to two after Blackburn completed a sensational double over the reigning champions at home while United recorded a victory over Aston Villa thanks to a [[David Beckham]] goal.\n\nApril began with a ruthless win at Old Trafford against Liverpool, which helped them reclaim top spot albeit temporarily. However, [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]]'s late own goal gifted Aston Villa a point when Arsenal perhaps should have taken all three. By the end of the week, just goal difference separated the top two, favouring the Gunners.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ten weeks that turned the title |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2992107.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}</ref> A 6\u20132 rout at Newcastle preceded the game of the season: against Arsenal at Highbury.

He was founding-member of the German artist groups ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' and [[Junge Wilde]], which arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nDokoupil lives and works between [[Madrid]], [[Rio de Janeiro|Prag, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro]],  and [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas.]].\n\n==Biography==\nJi\u0159\u00ed Dokoupil was born in [[Krnov]], then [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1954. After the invasion of the Soviet army in Prague in 1968, he escaped with his family over Austria to Germany. In 1976 he began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Cologne]]. Later on he also attended classes at the Universities of Frankfurt and the [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied among others under German concept artist [[Hans Haacke]]. The influence of Haacke is evident in Dokoupil\u2018s early work. From 1983\u201384 Dokoupil was guest professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and 1989 in [[Madrid]].\n\nIn 1979 Dokoupil founded the group ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' with artists such as Gerhard Naschberger, Hans Peter Adamski, Gerard Kever, Peter B\u00f6mmels and Walter Dahn. The group was associated with the art dealer Paul Maenz who organised Dokoupil\u2018s first solo exhibition in 1982. In their shared studio in Cologne on a street named M\u00fclheimer Freiheit, the six [[Junge Wilde|Jungen Wilden]]  sought to explore a contemporary expression for their art by using a [[neoexpressionism|neoexpressive]], figurative style of intensely colourful painting with traditional subjects and by overriding the intellectual, reduced formal language of [[Minimalism|Minimal]] and [[Conceptual Art]]. \"I\u2019d come to realize that the conceptual artists had become liars,\" Dokoupil has said. \"What they had promised us was salvation, art without form. But I\u2019d go into a gallery and there would be nothing to see, and it would be for a lot of money \u2013 that just couldn\u2019t be it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2012/dokoupil/|title=Dokoupil|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>   \n\nBut already in an early stage Dokoupil developed a less wild, rather unusual method of working and soon found his own radical subjective way with individual considerations. With his \"book painting\" shown at [[Documenta]] 7, [[Kassel]], in 1982, Dokoupil attracted the attention of the art world. It was a gigantic material painting called ''God, show me your balls'', a kind of homage to a [[Julian Schnabel]] plate painting, (which were made of broken ceramic dishes collaged into an image). Schnabel was not invited to participate in the exhibition \u2013 in Dokoupil\u2018s eyes a serious effront. Since then \u2013 besides the early group exhibitions with the ''M\u00fclheimer Freiheit'' \u2013 Dokoupil's work has been seen in numerous one-man shows in galleries, museums and at other cultural sites worldwide.\n\n==Works==\nIn accordance with the thesis of Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define  his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*M\u00fclheimer Freiheit (1980\u20131981)\n*New School of Cologne (1982)\n*Blue Paintings about Love (1982)\n*Documenta Paintings (1982)\n*Theoretical Paintings (1983)\n*Terry Cloth Paintings (1983\u20131984)\n*The Pacifier Paintings (1984)\n*The Apple Maiden (1984)\n{{col-3}}\n*Children Paintings (1983\u20131985)\n*Corporations & Products (1985\u20131986)\n*Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985\u20131987)\n*Esoteric Paintings (1987)\n*Jesus Paintings (1986\u20131987)\n*Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today)\n*Mother's Milk Paintings (1989\u20131991)\n*Tire Paintings (1991\u20131992)\n{{col-3}}\n*Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today)\n*The Green Paintings (1996)\n*Slavic Paintings (1996\u20131999)\n*Pigment Paintings (1998\u20132002)\n*Whip Paintings (2002\u20132003)\n*Buddha Paintings (2003\u20132004)\n*The Arrugadist Paintings (1999\u20132005)\n*Movie Paintings (2007\u20132009)\n{{col-end}}\n\nSince 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of ''Soot Paintings'', painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The ''Soot Paintings'', often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the ''Subastas''- series, of 1989 or recent ones called ''Leopards''(2000\u20132009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his ''Tire paintings'' of 1991\u20131992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his ''Soap Bubble Paintings'' of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates ''Whip Paintings'' by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil\u2018s most recent work is the series of spray-painted ''Buddhas'' on canvas. They are meant to be like [[Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] and [[Mona Lisa]] all at once, since [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]\u2018s Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century.\n\nEven though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of [[post-irony|post-modern irony]]. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today. In that sense Dokoupil could be seen as an \"artist inventor\": inventor of styles and techniques ultimately a clearly conceptual approach.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nSelected Exhibitions:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*Prague Castle Riding School, Praha, 2010\n*Galerie [[Bruno Bischofberger]] and Galerie Andrea Caratsch, Z\u00fcrich, 2009\n*Ben Brown Fine Arts, London, 2008\n*[[Deichtorhallen]], Hamburg, 2005\n*[[National Gallery in Prague|National Gallery, Praha]], 2005\n*Haus der Kunst, Brno (Czech republic), 2005\n*Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno CAAM, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 2003\n*Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover, 2002\n*[[Centraal Museum]], Utrecht, 2002\n*Milton Keynes Gallery, Central Milton Keynes, 2002\n*[[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid, 2002\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], Chenonceaux, 1999\n*Museum Weimar, Weimar, 1997\n*[[MUMOK|Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig]], Wien, 1997\n*Centre d'Art Contemporain de Fr\u00e9jus, Fr\u00e9jus, 1996\n*[[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery, New York, 1994\n*Sala Am\u00e1rica, Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1993\n*Galer\u00eda Juana de Aizpuru, Madrid, 1992\n*Horsens Kunstmuseum, Lund, 1991\n*Kunsthalle Kiel, Kiel, 1991\n*Robert Miller Gallery, New York, 1990\n*Fundaci\u00f3n Caja de Pensiones, Madrid, 1989\n{{col-3}}\n*Galerie Bruno Bischofberger, Z\u00fcrich, 1987\n*Ileana Sonnabend Gallery, New York, 1986\n*[[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, New York, 1985\n*[[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, 1984\n*Kunstmuseum Luzern, Luzern, 1984\n*[[Groninger Museum]], Groningen, 1984\n*Espace Lyonnais d'Art Contemporain, Lyon, 1984\n*Gallery [[Mary Boone]], New York, 1983\n*Galerie Paul Maenz, K\u00f6ln, 1982\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Collections==\n\nSelected Collections:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven\n* [[Neue Galerie - Sammlung Ludwig]], Aachen\n* [[Groninger Museum]], Groningen\n* Sonnabend Collection, New York\n* [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]\n* Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam\n* [[Kunsthaus Zurich]]\n* Metzger Collection, Museum Folkwang, Essen\n* Neue Galerie, Berlin\n{{col-3}}\n* Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation, Basel\n* Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund\n* Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt\n* The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul\n* Caixa de Pensiones, Barcelona\n* [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris\n* [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid\n* Museo de Bellas Artes de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz\n* Kunstmuseum Horsens, Denmark\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]\n* Kunsthalle zu Kiel\n* Paul Maenz Collection, Neues Museum Weimer\n* Bischofberger Collection, Zurich\n* [[Migros Museum]], Zurich\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 General Collection, Paris\n* Rubell Family Collection, Miami\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Films==\n\nHe acted in and co produced a few early films of [[Daryush Shokof]] amongst which [[dogs are not allowed]], and [[Ben Hur ,the Breathless,Taxi Driver in Casablanca]] and [[Flushers]] in 2013 in Berlin, Germany.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of German painters]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | editors=Wilfried Dickhoff, Robert Fleck | title=Dokoupil - Painting in the 21st Century | location=Hamburg | publisher=DUMONT | year=2005}} {{ISBN|3-8321-7553-9}}\n*{{cite book | editors=Carlos Ortega | title=dokoupil | location=Madrid |  publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda | year=2000}} {{ISBN|84-8003-976-0}}\n*{{cite book | editors=P\u00e9rez Esteban, Jos\u00e9 Antonio | title=Cuadros de humo: una constante esencial en la obra de Jiri Georg Dokoupil | location=M\u00fanich|  publisher=Grin| year=2013}} {{ISBN|978-3-656-49637-3}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artist/20138/jiri-georg-dokoupil.html Dokoupil at Artnet]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dokoupil}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Krnov]]\n[[Category:20th-century German painters]]\n[[Category:German male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century German painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Czech painters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:JiriDokoupil.jpg|thumb| Jiri Georg Dokoupil, 2004]]\n'''Ji\u0159\u00ed \"Georg\" Dokoupil''' (born 3 June 1954) is a Czech-German painter and graphic artist.

A selection of his series is listed below.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*M\u00fclheimer Freiheit (1980\u20131981)\n*New School of Cologne (1982)\n*Blue Paintings about Love (1982)\n*Documenta Paintings (1982)\n*Theoretical Paintings (1983)\n*Terry Cloth Paintings (1983\u20131984)\n*The Pacifier Paintings (1984)\n*The Apple Maiden (1984)\n{{col-3}}\n*Children Paintings (1983\u20131985)\n*Corporations & Products (1985\u20131986)\n*Madonnas in Ecstasy (1985\u20131987)\n*Esoteric Paintings (1987)\n*Jesus Paintings (1986\u20131987)\n*Soot Paintings (Candle and Torch) (1989-today)\n*Mother's Milk Paintings (1989\u20131991)\n*Tire Paintings (1991\u20131992)\n{{col-3}}\n*Soap Bubble Paintings (1992-today)\n*The Green Paintings (1996)\n*Slavic Paintings (1996\u20131999)\n*Pigment Paintings (1998\u20132002)\n*Whip Paintings (2002\u20132003)\n*Buddha Paintings (2003\u20132004)\n*The Arrugadist Paintings (1999\u20132005)\n*Movie Paintings (2007\u20132009)\n{{col-end}}\n\nSince 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of ''Soot Paintings'', painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The ''Soot Paintings'', often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the ''Subastas''- series, of 1989 or recent ones called ''Leopards''(2000\u20132009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his ''Tire paintings'' of 1991\u20131992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his ''Soap Bubble Paintings'' of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates ''Whip Paintings'' by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil\u2018s most recent work is the series of spray-painted ''Buddhas'' on canvas. They are meant to be like [[Buddha]], [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] and [[Mona Lisa]] all at once, since [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]]\u2018s Marilyn is the Mona Lisa of the 20th century.\n\nEven though a retrospective of his oeuvre would resemble a group show of different painters, it has nothing to do with any pluralism of styles, with the claim of the coincidence of styles, or with a variety of [[post-irony|post-modern irony]]. The focus of his multifaceted oeuvre is in fact on exploring original techniques and configurations generating a domain for playful experimentation and physical tension in which new images can arise and assuring that the act of making images is independent of the iconographic compulsions of the media world today. In that sense Dokoupil could be seen as an \"artist inventor\": inventor of styles and techniques ultimately a clearly conceptual approach.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\nSelected Exhibitions:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*Prague Castle Riding School, Praha, 2010\n*Galerie [[Bruno Bischofberger]] and Galerie Andrea Caratsch, Z\u00fcrich, 2009\n*Ben Brown Fine Arts, London, 2008\n*[[Deichtorhallen]], Hamburg, 2005\n*[[National Gallery in Prague|National Gallery, Praha]], 2005\n*Haus der Kunst, Brno (Czech republic), 2005\n*Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno CAAM, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 2003\n*Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover, 2002\n*[[Centraal Museum]], Utrecht, 2002\n*Milton Keynes Gallery, Central Milton Keynes, 2002\n*[[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid, 2002\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]], Chenonceaux, 1999\n*Museum Weimar, Weimar, 1997\n*[[MUMOK|Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig]], Wien, 1997\n*Centre d'Art Contemporain de Fr\u00e9jus, Fr\u00e9jus, 1996\n*[[Tony Shafrazi]] Gallery, New York, 1994\n*Sala Am\u00e1rica, Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1993\n*Galer\u00eda Juana de Aizpuru, Madrid, 1992\n*Horsens Kunstmuseum, Lund, 1991\n*Kunsthalle Kiel, Kiel, 1991\n*Robert Miller Gallery, New York, 1990\n*Fundaci\u00f3n Caja de Pensiones, Madrid, 1989\n{{col-3}}\n*Galerie Bruno Bischofberger, Z\u00fcrich, 1987\n*Ileana Sonnabend Gallery, New York, 1986\n*[[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, New York, 1985\n*[[Museum Folkwang]], Essen, 1984\n*Kunstmuseum Luzern, Luzern, 1984\n*[[Groninger Museum]], Groningen, 1984\n*Espace Lyonnais d'Art Contemporain, Lyon, 1984\n*Gallery [[Mary Boone]], New York, 1983\n*Galerie Paul Maenz, K\u00f6ln, 1982\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Collections==\n\nSelected Collections:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven\n* [[Neue Galerie - Sammlung Ludwig]], Aachen\n* [[Groninger Museum]], Groningen\n* Sonnabend Collection, New York\n* [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]\n* Boymans van Beuningen, Rotterdam\n* [[Kunsthaus Zurich]]\n* Metzger Collection, Museum Folkwang, Essen\n* Neue Galerie, Berlin\n{{col-3}}\n* Emanuel Hoffmann Foundation, Basel\n* Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund\n* Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt\n* The National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul\n* Caixa de Pensiones, Barcelona\n* [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris\n* [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]], Madrid\n* Museo de Bellas Artes de Alava, Vitoria-Gasteiz\n* Kunstmuseum Horsens, Denmark\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]\n* Kunsthalle zu Kiel\n* Paul Maenz Collection, Neues Museum Weimer\n* Bischofberger Collection, Zurich\n* [[Migros Museum]], Zurich\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 General Collection, Paris\n* Rubell Family Collection, Miami\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Films==\n\nHe acted in and co produced a few early films of [[Daryush Shokof]] amongst which [[dogs are not allowed]], and [[Ben Hur ,the Breathless,Taxi Driver in Casablanca]] and [[Flushers]] in 2013 in Berlin, Germany.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of German painters]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | editors=Wilfried Dickhoff, Robert Fleck | title=Dokoupil - Painting in the 21st Century | location=Hamburg | publisher=DUMONT | year=2005}} {{ISBN|3-8321-7553-9}}\n*{{cite book | editors=Carlos Ortega | title=dokoupil | location=Madrid |  publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda | year=2000}} {{ISBN|84-8003-976-0}}\n*{{cite book | editors=P\u00e9rez Esteban, Jos\u00e9 Antonio | title=Cuadros de humo: una constante esencial en la obra de Jiri Georg Dokoupil | location=M\u00fanich|  publisher=Grin| year=2013}} {{ISBN|978-3-656-49637-3}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artist/20138/jiri-georg-dokoupil.html Dokoupil at Artnet]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dokoupil}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Krnov]]\n[[Category:20th-century German painters]]\n[[Category:German male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century German painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century Czech painters]]\n", "name_user": "HK Berlin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added artist names.

The central concepts of the model however follow from [[Louis Hjelmslev |Louis Hjelmslev's]] book ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'' which was published in 1943 in Danish and followed by an English translation by Francis J.

First, it functions as a descriptive device, or as Hjelmslev explains it:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"We demand for example from the theory of language that it allow to describe correctly and exhaustively not only such given French text, but also all existing French texts, and not only these but also all possible and conceivable French texts\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelmslev |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Hjelmslev |date=1971 |orig-year=1943 |title=Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes \u00e0 une th\u00e9orie du langage |quote= Nous exigeons par exemple de la th\u00e9orie du langage qu\u2019elle permettre de d\u00e9crire non contradictoirement et exhaustivement non seulement tel texte fran\u00e7ais donn\u00e9, mais aussi tous les textes fran\u00e7ais existant, et non seulement ceux-ci mais encore tous les textes fran\u00e7ais possibles et concevables |location=Paris |publisher=Les \u00e9ditions de minuit |page=27 |isbn= 2707301345}}</ref>|author= }}\nWhen this work is done to a satisfactory level, it will also become possible to predict all the grammatical sentences of a given language:\n{{Quote|text=\n\u201cThanks to the linguistic knowledge thus acquired, we will be able to construct, for the same language, all conceivable or theoretically possible texts.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelmslev |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Hjelmslev |date=1971 |orig-year=1943 |title=Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes \u00e0 une th\u00e9orie du langage |quote= Gr\u00e2ce aux connaissances linguistiques ainsi acquises, nous pourrons construire, pour une m\u00eame langue, tous les textes concevables ou th\u00e9oriquement possibles. |location=Paris |publisher=Les \u00e9ditions de minuit |page=27 |isbn= 2707301345}}</ref>|author= }}\nHjelmslev also points out that an algorithmic description of a language could generate an infinite number of products from a finite number of primitive elements:<ref name=Seuren_1998 /> \n{{Quote|text=\n\"When we compare the inventories yielded at the various stages of the deduction, their size will usually turn out to decrease as the procedure goes on.

Hjelmslev was a [[structuralism | structuralist]] and applied mathematical models to [[Ferdinand de Saussure | Ferdinand de Saussure's]] concept of language as an interactive system of meaning and form. Although the [[Leonard Bloomfield | Bloomfieldian]] school of early to mid-20th century linguists were nicknamed 'American structuralists', they essentially rejected the basic tenets of structuralism: that linguistic form is explained through meaning, and that linguistics belongs to the domain of [[sociology]].<ref name=Seuren_1998 /><ref name=Joseph_2002 /><ref name=Tomalin_2006 />\n\nInstead, the idea of language endorsed by Leonard Bloomfield and his followers derived from [[William Wundt |William Wundt's]] [[mentalism (psychology) |mentalistic psychology]] which was replaced by [[behavioural psychology]] in Bloomfield's 1933 book ''Language''. This led to the separation of syntax from semantics as not an observable link in a [[stimulus\u2013response]] chain. Chomsky, like Harris and other American linguists, agreed that there is no causal link from semantics to syntax.<ref name=Seuren_1998 />\n\nDespite the paradigm shift, American linguists maintained Wundt's syntactic analysis which entails the placement of the [[object (grammar) | grammatical object]] into the [[verb phrase]]. They believed that languages should be analysed based on how native speakers feel is right. How to translate this idea into a scientific statement remained a vexing issue in American linguistics for decades.<ref name=Seuren_1998 /> Harris and [[Rulon Wells]] justified analysing the object as part of the verb phrase per 'economy'; but this term, again, merely suggested the perceived 'easiness' of the practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Rulon S. |date=1947 |title=Immediate constituents |journal=Language |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=81\u2013117 |doi= 10.2307/410382|jstor=410382 }}</ref>\n\nIn Syntactic Structures, Chomsky changes the meaning of Hjelmslev's principle of ''arbitrariness'' which meant that the generative calculus is merely a tool for the linguist and not a structure in reality.<ref name=Seuren_1998 /><ref name=Hjelmslev_1969 /> [[David Lightfoot (linguist) |David Lightfoot]] however points out in his introduction to the second edition that there were few points of true interest in Syntactic Structures itself, and the eventual interpretations that the rules or structures are 'cognitive', innate, or biological would have been made elsewhere, especially in the context of a debate between Chomsky and the advocates of behaviourism.<ref name=Lightfoot_2002>{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=David W. |year=2002  |chapter=Introduction to the second edition of Syntactic Structures by Noam Chomsky | chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/4073170 |chapter-format= |editor-last=Lightfoot |editor-first=David W. |editor-link=David Lightfoot (linguist) |title=Syntactic Structures |edition=second |location=Berlin |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=v-xviii |isbn=3110172798  |access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> But decades later Chomsky makes the clear statement that syntactic structures, including the object as a dependent of the verb phrase, are caused by a genetic [[mutation]] in humans.<ref name=Berwick&Chomsky_2015>{{cite book |last1=Berwick|first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky|first2=Noam | title=Why Only Us: Language and Evolution|publisher=MIT Press |date=2015  |isbn=9780262034241| author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Chomsky as a young linguist===\n[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky, the author of ''Syntactic Structures'' (1977 photo)]]\nChomsky's interest in language started at an early age.

He places emphasis on \"rigorous formulations\" and \"precisely constructed models\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|loc=Preface}}</ref> In the first chapter of the book, he gives a definition of human language [[syntax]]. He then talks about the goals of syntactic study. For Chomsky, a linguist's goal is to build a [[grammar]] of a language. He defines grammar as a device which produces all the sentences of the language under study. Secondly, a linguist must find the abstract concepts beneath grammars to develop a general method. This method would help select the best possible device or grammar for any language given its [[Speech corpus|corpus]]. Finally, a linguistic theory must give a satisfactory description of all the levels of language analysis. Examples of these levels include [[phonology|sounds]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|words]] and [[syntax|sentence structures]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=5&ndash;6}}</ref>\n\n===Grammaticality===\n{{See also|Grammaticality|Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}}\n[[File:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|400px|A tree diagram of the sentence \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\"]]\nThe second chapter is titled \"The Independence of Grammar\". In it, Chomsky states that a language is \"a set ... of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements\". A linguist should separate the \"grammatical sequences\" or sentences of a language from the \"ungrammatical sequences\".<ref name=\"ss\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=13}}</ref> By a \"grammatical\" sentence Chomsky means a sentence that is intuitively \"acceptable to a native speaker\".<ref name=\"ss\" /> It is a sentence pronounced with a \"normal sentence intonation\". It is also \"recall[ed] much more quickly\" and \"learn[ed] much more easily\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=16}}</ref>\n\nChomsky then analyzes further about the basis of \"grammaticality.\" He shows three ways that do ''not'' determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not. First, a grammatical sentence need not be included in a corpus. Secondly, it need not be meaningful. Finally, it does not have to be statistically probable. Chomsky shows all three points using a nonsensical sentence \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=15}}</ref> He writes that the sentence is instinctively \"grammatical\" to a native English speaker. But it is not included in any known corpus at the time and is neither meaningful nor [[Probability distribution|statistically probable]].\n\nChomsky concludes that \"grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning.\" He adds that \"probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure.\"<ref name=\"ChomSynAuto\" />\n\n====Carnap's influence====\nBritish linguist Marcus Tomalin stated that a version of \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" was suggested decades earlier by [[Rudolf Carnap]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2002}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rebuschi|2001|p=2014}}</ref> This German philosopher offered in 1934 the pseudo-sentence \"Piroten karulieren elatisch\".<ref>{{harvnb|Carnap|1934|p=2}}</ref> According to American linguist Reese Heitner, Carnap's sentence showed the autonomy of both syntactic and phonological structures.<ref group=\"note\">According to {{harvnb|Heitner|2005}}: \"[Carnap's sentence] actually does the double duty of demonstrating the \"autonomy\" of syntactic and phonological structure, an indication that not only can sentences be recognized as syntactically well-formed, but individual words can also be recognized as phonologically well-formed independent of semantics.\"</ref>\n\n===Grammar models and transformations===\n{{See also|Transformational grammar}}\nIn the third chapter titled \"An Elementary Linguistic Theory\", Chomsky tries to determine what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of a given set of \"grammatical\" sentences.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=18}}</ref> Chomsky hypothesizes that this device has to be finite instead of infinite. He then considers [[finite state grammar]], a [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication|communication theoretic]] model<ref group=\"note\">Specifically, the model proposed in {{harvnb|Shannon|Weaver|1949}}</ref> which treats language as a [[Markov process]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=19&ndash;21}}</ref> Then in the fourth chapter titled \"Phrase Structure\", he discusses [[phrase structure grammar]], a model based on [[immediate constituent analysis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=26&ndash;33}}</ref> In the fifth chapter titled \"Limitations of Phrase Structure Description\", he claims to show that both these models are inadequate for the purpose of linguistic description. As a solution, he introduces [[transformational generative grammar]] (TGG), \"a more powerful model&nbsp;... that might remedy these inadequacies.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\"/>\n[[File:Chomsky-Syntactic-Structures-Grammar-Model.jpg|thumb|400px|The grammar model discussed in Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' (1957)]]\nChomsky's transformational grammar has three parts: [[phrase structure rule]]s, [[transformational rules]] and [[Morphophonemics|morphophonemic]] rules.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 45\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=45}}</ref> The phrase structure rules are used for expanding [[Lexical category|grammatical categories]] <!-- Here grammatical category is actually lexical category--> and for substitutions. These yield a string of [[morpheme]]s. A transformational rule \"operates on a given string&nbsp;... with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 44\"/> It \"may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 46\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=46}}</ref> Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the \"terminal strings\" of the grammar produce the \"kernel of the language\".<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 45\"/> Kernel sentences are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of [[phoneme]]s.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 46\"/> Chomsky then applies this idea of transformational rules in the [[English language|English]] [[auxiliary verb]] system.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=38&ndash;40}}</ref>\n\n====Borrowing of terminology====\nIn ''Syntactic Structures'', the term \"transformation\" was borrowed from the works of [[Zellig Harris]]. Harris was Chomsky's initial mentor. Harris used the term \"transformation\" to describe equivalence relations between sentences of a language. By contrast, Chomsky's used the term to describe a formal rule applied to underlying structures of sentences.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2008|pp=66&ndash;67}}</ref>\n\nChomsky also borrowed the term \"generative\" from a previous work of mathematician [[Emil Post]].<ref group=\"note\">In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}, Chomsky writes that he was \"following a familiar technical use of the term \"generate,\" cf. {{harvnb|Post|1944}}\". In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=9}}, Chomksy justifies his choice of the term \"generate\", writing that \"the term 'generate' is familiar in the sense intended here in logic, particularly in Post's theory of combinatorial systems. Furthermore, 'generate' seems to be the most appropriate translation for Humboldt's term ''erzeugen'', which he frequently uses, it seems, in essentially the sense here intended. Since this use of the term 'generate' is well established both in logic and in the tradition of linguistic theory.\"</ref> Post wanted to \"mechanically [derive] inferences from an initial axiomatic sentence\".<ref>{{harvnb|Post|1943}},  {{harvnb|Post|1944}} and  {{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}</ref> Chomsky applied Post's work on [[logical inference]] to describe sets of [[String (computer science)|string]]s (sequence of letters or sounds) of a human language. When he says a finite set of rules \"generate\" (i.e. \"recursively enumerate\"<ref>{{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}</ref>) the set of potentially infinite number of sentences of a particular human language, he means that they provide an explicit, structural description of those sentences.<ref group=\"note\">In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=8}}, Chomsky writes that \"by a generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences.\"</ref>\n\n===Justification of grammars===\nIn the sixth chapter titled \"On the Goals of Linguistic Theory\", Chomsky writes that his \"fundamental concern\" is \"the problem of justification of grammars\".<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\"/> He draws parallels between the theory of language and theories in [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]]. He compares a finite [[Speech corpus|corpus]] of [[utterance]]s of a particular language to \"[[observation]]s\". He likens grammatical rules to \"[[Physical law|laws]]\" which are stated in terms of \"hypothetical constructs\" such as [[phoneme]]s, [[phrase]]s, etc.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=49}}</ref> According to Chomsky, the criteria for the \"justification of grammars\" are \"external conditions of adequacy\", the \"condition of generality\" and \"simplicity\". To choose the best possible grammar for a given corpus of a given language, Chomsky shows his preference for the \"evaluation procedure\" (which uses the aforementioned criteria). He rejects the \"discovery procedure\"<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=55}} writes: \"Our main point is that a linguistic theory should not be identified with a manual of useful procedures, nor should it be expected to provide mechanical procedures for the discovery of grammars\"</ref> (employed in [[structural linguistics]] and supposed to automatically and mechanically produce the correct grammar of a language from a corpus<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|pp=76}} notes that \"the fullest and most interesting expression of 'discovery procedure' is [the] book ''Methods in Structural Linguistics'' ({{harvnb|Harris|1951}}) by Zellig Harris, Chomsky's mentor.</ref>). He also dismisses the \"decision procedure\" (supposed to automatically choose the best grammar for a language from a set of competing grammars).<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=49&ndash;56}}</ref> Chomsky thus shows preference for \"explanatory depth\" with some \"empirical inadequacies\" over the pursuit of very detailed empirical coverage of all data.<ref group=\"note\">See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1978|pp=9\u201310}}. Chomsky characterized this approach as the \"Galilean Style\" of inquiry which had already been applied in modern natural sciences with \"great success\" since the 17th century.</ref>\n\n===Application of transformational grammar in English===\nIn the seventh chapter titled \"Some Transformations in English\", Chomsky strictly applies his just-proposed transformation-based approach on some aspects of English. He treats at length the formation of [[English language|English]] [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Passive voice|passive]] sentences, yes-no and wh- [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] sentences, etc. He claims in the end that transformational analysis can describe \"a wide variety of&nbsp;... distinct phenomena\" in English grammar in a \"simple\", \"natural\" and \"orderly\" way.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=68}} states:\"a wide variety of apparently distinct phenomena [in English language] all fall into place in a very simple and natural way when we adopt the viewpoint of transformational analysis and that, consequently, the grammar of English becomes much more simple and orderly.\"</ref>\n\n===Constructional homonymity and distinct levels of linguistic analysis===\nIn the eighth chapter titled \"The explanatory power of linguistic theory\", Chomsky writes a linguistic theory cannot content itself by just  generating valid grammatical sentences. It also has to account for other structural phenomena at different levels of linguistic representation. At a certain linguistic level, there can be two items which can be understood having different meanings but they are structurally indistinguishable within that level. This is called a \u201cconstructional homonymity\u201d [sic]. The relevant ambiguity can be resolved by establishing a higher level of linguistic analysis. At this higher level, the two items can be clearly shown having two different structural interpretations. In this way, constructional homonymities at the phonemic level can be resolved by establishing the level of morphology, and so forth. One of the motivation of establishing a distinct, higher level of linguistic analysis is, then, to explain the structural ambiguity due to the constructional homonymities at a lower level. On the other hand, each linguistic level also captures some structural similarities within the level that are not explained in lower levels. Chomsky uses this argument as well to motivate the establishment of distinct levels of linguistic analysis.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=85\u201387}}</ref>\n\nChomsky then shows that a grammar which analyzes sentences up to the phrase structure level contains many constructional homonymities at the phrase structure level where the resulting ambiguities need to be explained at a higher level. Then he shows how his newly invented \u201ctransformational level\u201d can naturally and successfully function as that higher level. He further claims that any phrase structure grammar which cannot explain these ambiguities as successfully as transformational grammar does must be considered \"inadequate\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=91}}</ref>\n\n===Role of semantics in syntax===\nIn the ninth chapter titled \"Syntax and Semantics\", Chomsky reminds that his analysis so far has been \"completely [[Formal language|formal]] and non-semantic.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=93}}</ref> He then offers many counterexamples to refute some common linguistic assertions about grammar's reliance on [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. He concludes that the correspondence between meaning and grammatical form is \"imperfect\", \"inexact\" and \"vague.\" Consequently, it is \"relatively useless\" to use meaning \"as a basis for grammatical description\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=101}}</ref> To support his point, Chomsky considers a similar relation between semantics and [[phonology]]. He shows that in order to build a theory of [[Phoneme|phonemic]] distinction based on meaning would entail \"complex\", \"exhaustive\" and \"laborious investigation\" of an \"immense\", \"vast [[Speech corpus|corpus]]\".<ref name=\"chomcorp\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=96&ndash;97}}</ref> By contrast, phonemic distinctness can be easily explained in a \"straightforward\" way and in \"completely non-semantic terms\" with the help of \"pair tests\".<ref name=\"chomcorp\" /> Chomsky also claims that a strictly formal, non-semantic framework of syntactic theory might ultimately be useful to support a parallel independent semantic theory.<ref group=\"note\">Because it would \"reveal\" insights about sentence structures. See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=103}}</ref>\n\n==Rhetorical style==\nRandy Allen Harris, a specialist of the [[rhetoric of science]], writes that ''Syntactic Structures'' \"appeals calmly and insistently to a new conception\" of linguistic science. He finds the book \"lucid, convincing, syntactically daring, the calm voice of reason&nbsp;... [speaking] directly to the imagination and ambition of the entire field.\" It also bridged the \"rhetorical gulf\" to make the message of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (a highly abstract, mathematically dense, and \"forbiddingly technical\" work) more palatable to the wider field of linguists.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1993|loc=Chapter 3}}</ref> In a more detailed examination of the book, Harris finds Chomsky's argumentation in ''Syntactic Structures'' \"multilayered and compelling\". Chomsky not only makes a logical appeal (i.e. [[logos]]) to a highly formalized model of language, but also appeals explicitly and tacitly to the [[Ethos#Rhetoric|ethos]] of science.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1989}}</ref>\n\nIn particular, Chomsky\u2019s analysis of the complex English auxiliary verb system in ''Syntactic Structures'' had great rhetorical effect. It combined simple phrase structure rules with a simple transformational rule. This treatment was based entirely on formal simplicity. Various linguists have described it as \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cpowerful\u201d, \u201celegant\u201d, \u201crevealing\u201d, \u201cinsightful\u201d, \u201cbeguiling\u201d and \u201cingenious\u201d.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}} wrote that \u201c[Chomsky\u2019s] examples of defects of phrase structure grammar were illustrated simultaneously with the demonstration that grammars containing the more powerful transformational rules can handle the same phenomena in an elegant and revealing manner.\u201d</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to {{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=188}}, \"this apparently curious analysis is rather ingenious\" and \"the powerful tool of different levels of structure related by transformations was particularly beguiling, since  transformations appeared to offer a means of explaining the often amazingly complex relationships between the forms of sentences and their understanding.\"</ref><ref group=\"note\">In his introduction to ''Syntactic Structures'' ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=ix}}), American linguist David Lightfoot wrote that \"this ingenious transformation...avoided hopelessly complex phrase structure rules and yielded an elegant account... \u201d</ref> According to American linguist Frederick Newmeyer, this particular analysis won many \u201csupporters for Chomsky\u201d and \u201cimmediately led to some linguists\u2019 proposing generative-transformational analysis of particular phenomena\u201d.<ref>{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}}</ref> According to British linguist E. Keith Brown, \"the elegance and insightfulness of this account was instantly recognized, and this was an important factor in ensuring the initial success of the transformational way of looking at syntax.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=186}}</ref> American linguist Mark Aronoff wrote that this \u201cbeautiful analysis and description of some very striking facts was the rhetorical weapon that drove the acceptance of [Chomsky\u2019s] theory\u201d. He added that in Chomsky\u2019s treatment of English verbs, \u201cthe convergence of theory and analysis provide a description of facts so convincing that it changed the entire field\u201d.<ref>{{harvnb|Aronoff|2014}}</ref>\n\nRaymond Oenbring, a doctorate in the rhetoric of science, thinks that Chomsky \"overstates the novelty\" of transformational rules. He \"seems to take all the credit for them\" even though a version of them had already been introduced by [[Zellig Harris]] in a previous work. He writes that Chomsky himself was \"cautious\" to \"display deference\" to prevailing linguistic research. His enthusiastic followers such as [[Robert Lees (linguist)|Lees]] were, by contrast, much more \"confrontational\". They sought to drive a \"rhetorical wedge\" between Chomsky's work and that of post-Bloomfieldians (i.e. American linguists in the 1940s et 1950s), arguing that the latter does not qualify as linguistic \"science\".<ref>{{harvnb|Oenbring|2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Impact on linguistics===\nIn an early review of the book, American structural linguist [[Charles F. Voegelin]] wrote that ''Syntactic Structures'' posed a fundamental challenge to the established way of doing linguistic research. He stated that it had the potential to accomplish \"a [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]]\" within linguistics.<ref>{{harvnb|Voegelin|1958}}</ref> Another American linguist [[Martin Joos]] called the Chomskyan brand of linguistic theory a \"heresy\" within the [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] tradition.<ref>{{harvnb|Joos|1961}}</ref> These early remarks proved to be prescient. American linguist [[Paul Postal]] commented in 1964 that most of the \"syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States\" were \"versions of the theory of [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the sense of Chomsky\".<ref>{{harvnb|Postal|1964}}</ref> By 1965, linguists were saying that  ''Syntactic Structures'' had \"mark[ed] an epoch\",<ref>{{harvnb|Levin|1965|p=92}}</ref> had a \"startling impact\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bach|1965|pp=111&ndash;12}}</ref> and created a [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhnian]] \"revolution\".<ref>{{harvnb|Thorne|1965|p=74}}</ref> British linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] wrote in 1966 that \"no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lyons|1966}}</ref> British historian of linguistics [[R. H. Robins]] wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' was \"probably the most radical and important change in direction in [[descriptive linguistics]] and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years\".<ref>{{harvnb|Robins|1967|p=226}}</ref>\n\nAnother historian of linguistics [[Frederick Newmeyer]] considers ''Syntactic Structures'' \"revolutionary\" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a [[Formal language|formal]] yet non-[[Empiricism|empiricist]] theory of language was possible. Chomsky demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of [[English grammar]]. Secondly, it put [[syntax]] at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. Subsequently, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the study of structure and formation of words) and [[phonology]] (i.e. the study of organization of sounds in languages) were relegated in importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1996|pp=24&ndash;26}}</ref>\n\nAmerican linguist Norbert Hornstein wrote that before ''Syntactic Structures'', linguistic research was overly preoccupied with creating hierarchies and categories of all observable language data. One of the \"lasting contributions\" of  ''Syntactic Structures'' is that it shifted the linguistic research methodology to abstract, rationalist theory-making based on contacts with data, which is the \"common scientific practice\".<ref>{{cite web | title=On Syntactic Structures | website=Faculty of Language| author = Norbert Hornstein |date = 27 January 2017 | url=http://facultyoflanguage.blogspot.com/2017/01/on-syntactic-structures.html | accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on other disciplines===\n;Psychology\nThe generative grammar of ''Syntactic Structures'' heralded Chomsky's [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] perspective in linguistic analysis. Shortly after its publication, in 1959, Chomsky wrote a critical review<ref name=\"Chomsky 1959\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}</ref> of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Skinner|1957}}</ref> Skinner had presented the [[Language acquisition|acquisition]] of human language in terms of conditioned responses to outside [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and [[reinforcement]]. Chomsky opposed this [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] model. He argued that humans produce language using separate syntactic and semantic components inside the [[mind]]. He presented the generative grammar as a coherent abstract description of this underlying [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] reality.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1959\"/> Chomsky's argument had a forceful impact on psycholinguistic research. It changed the course of the discipline in the following years.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"BehavCritic\">According to {{harvnb|Steinberg|Hiroshi|Aline|2013|p=371}}: \"[Chomsky's generative system of rules] was more powerful that anything&nbsp;... psycholinguists had heretofore had at their disposal. [It] was of special interest to these theorists. Many psychologists were quick to attribute generative systems to the minds of speakers and quick to abandon&nbsp;... Behaviorism.\"</ref>\n;Philosophy\n''Syntactic Structures'' initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between [[Philosophy of language|philosophers of language]] and linguists. American philosopher [[John Searle]] called it a \"remarkable intellectual achievement\" of its time. He compared the book \"to the work of [[Keynes]] or [[Freud]]\". He credited it with producing not only a \"revolution in linguistics\", but also having a \"revolutionary effect\" on \"[[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]\".<ref name=\"Searle 1972\"/> Chomsky and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], a stridently anti-mentalistic philosopher of language, debated many times on the merit of Chomsky's linguistic theories.<ref>{{harvnb|Quine|1969}}</ref> Many philosophers supported Chomsky's idea that natural languages are [[Psychological nativism#Language|innate]] and syntactically rule-governed. They also believed in the existence of rules in the human mind which bind meanings to [[utterance]]s. The investigation of these rules started a new era in [[philosophical semantics]].<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Stokhof|2012|p=548}} writes: \"That natural languages are indeed not systematic enough to allow formal treatment&nbsp;... is&nbsp;... a complaint that has been leveled against natural languages by philosophers for centuries. The work of Chomsky in generative linguistics apparently inspired much more confidence in philosophers and logicians to assert that perhaps natural languages weren't as unsystematic and misleading as their philosophical predecessors had made them out to be&nbsp;... at the end of 1960s formal semantics began to flourish.\"</ref><ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1967}} writes: \"Recent work by Chomsky and others is doing much to bring the complexities of natural languages within the scope of serious semantic theory\".</ref>\n;Computer science\nWith its formal and logical treatment of language, ''Syntactic Structures'' also brought linguistics and the new field of [[computer science]] closer together. Computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] (winner of the [[Turing Award]]) recounted that he read ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1961 and was influenced by it.<ref group=\"note\">From the preface of {{harvnb|Knuth|2003}}: \"...&nbsp;researchers in linguistics were beginning to formulate rules of grammar that were considerably more mathematical than before. And people began to realize that such methods are highly relevant to the artificial languages that were becoming popular for computer programming, even though natural languages like English remained intractable. I found the mathematical approach to grammar immediately appealing\u2014so much so, in fact, that I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' along with me on my honeymoon in 1961. During odd moments, while crossing the Atlantic in an ocean liner and while camping in Europe, I read that book rather thoroughly and tried to answer some basic theoretical questions. Here was a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition! The mathematical, linguistic, and algorithmic parts of my life had previously been totally separate. During the ensuing years those three aspects became steadily more intertwined; and by the end of the 1960s I found myself a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, primarily because of work that I had done with respect to languages for computer programming.\"</ref> Chomsky's \"Three models\" paper ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1956}}), published a year prior to the ''Syntactic Structures'' and containing many of its ideas, was crucial to the development of the theory of [[formal languages]] within computer science.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Boden|2006|p=648}} writes:\"[Papers like the \"Three Models\"] had a huge, lasting influence on pure computer science\" and that they are cited in \"virtually every introduction to compiler design\". {{harvnb|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=9}} states that \"Chomsky's notion of a context-free grammar&nbsp;... has aided immensely the specification of programming languages.\"</ref>\n;Neuroscience\nIn 2011, a group of French neuroscientists conducted research to verify if actual brain mechanisms worked in the way that Chomsky suggested in ''Syntactic Structures''. The results suggested that specific regions of the brain handle syntactic information in an abstract way. These are independent from other brain regions that handle semantic information. Moreover, the brain analyzes not just mere strings of words, but hierarchical structures of constituents. These observations validated the theoretical claims of Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pallier|Devauchelle|Dehaene|2011|pp=2522&ndash;2527}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]] at [[New York University]] conducted experiments to verify if the human brain uses \"hierarchical structure building\" for processing languages. They measured the magnetic and electric activities in the brains of participants. The results showed that \"[human] brains distinctly tracked three components of the phrases they heard.\" This   \"[reflected] a hierarchy in our [[Neurolinguistics|neural processing]] of linguistic structures: words, phrases, and then sentences\u2014at the same time.\" These results bore out Chomsky's hypothesis in ''Syntactic Structures'' of an \"internal grammar mechanism\" inside the brain.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chomsky Was Right, NYU Researchers Find: We Do Have a \"Grammar\" in Our Head | website=New York University | url=http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/december/chomsky-was-right-nyu-researchers-find-we-do-have-a-grammar-in-our-head.html | accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n;Erroneous idealization\nIn his 1964 presidential address to the [[Linguistic Society of America]], American linguist [[Charles Hockett]] considered ''Syntactic Structures'' one of \"only four major breakthroughs in modern linguistics\".<ref name=\"hockett\">{{harvnb|Hockett|1965|p=185}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">The other three are [[Sir William Jones]]'s address to the Asiatic Society in 1786, [[Karl Verner]]'s ''Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung'' in 1875 and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de Linguistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]'' in 1916.</ref> But he rapidly turned into a fierce critic of Chomskyan linguistics. By 1966, Hockett rejected \"[Chomsky's] frame of reference in almost every detail\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hockett|1966|p=156}}</ref> In his 1968 book ''The State of the Art'', Hockett writes that Chomsky's main [[fallacy]] is that he treats language as a [[Formal science|formal]], well-defined, stable system and proceeds from this idealized [[abstraction]]. Hockett believes such an idealization is not possible. He claims that there is no [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]] that our [[language faculty]] is, in reality, a well-defined underlying system. The sources that give rise to language faculty in humans, e.g. physical [[genetic transmission]] and cultural transmission, are themselves poorly defined.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|p=83}} states:  \"we must not promote our more or less standardized by-and-large characterization of the language to the status of a monolithic ideal, nor infer that because we can achieve a fixed characterization some such monolithic ideal exists, in the lap of [[God]] or in the brain of each individual speaker.\"</ref> Hockett also opposed Chomsky's hypothesis that syntax is completely independent of the study of meaning.<ref>{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|pp=67\u201371}}</ref>\n;Non-empiricism\nContrary to Hockett, British linguist [[Geoffrey Sampson]] thought that Chomsky's assumptions about a well-defined grammaticality are \"[justified] in practice.\" It brought syntax \"within the purview of scientific description\". He considers it a \"great positive contribution to the discipline\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|p=134}}</ref> However, he maintains that Chomsky's linguistics is overly \"[[intuition]]-based\". For him, it relies too much on native speakers' subjective [[Introspection|introspective]] judgments about their own language. Consequently, language data empirically observed by impersonal third parties are given less importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=5}}, {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=10}} and {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=13}}</ref> \n;Influence of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''\nAccording to Sampson, ''Syntactic Structures'' largely owes its good fortune of becoming the dominant theoretical paradigm in the following years to the charisma of Chomsky's intellect. Sampson writes that there are many references in ''Syntactic Structures'' to Chomsky's own ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (LSLT) in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but ''LSLT'' was not widely available in print for decades. Nevertheless, Sampson's argument runs, ''Syntactic Structures'', albeit \"sketchy\", derived its \"aura of respectability\" from ''LSLT'' lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref name=\"Sampson 2001 152\"/> In the view of British-American linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]], ''Syntactic Structures'' boldly claims that \"it is impossible, not just difficult\" for finite-state devices to generate all grammatical sentences of English, and then alludes to ''LSLT'' for the \"rigorous proof\" of this. But in reality, ''LSLT'' does not contain a valid, convincing proof dismissing finite-state devices.<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\">{{harvnb|Pullum|2011}}</ref>\n;Originality\nPullum also remarks that the \"originality\" of ''Syntactic Structures'' is \"highly overstated\". For him, it \"does not properly credit the earlier literature on which it draws\".<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/> He shows in detail how the approach in ''Syntactic Structures'' goes directly back to the work of the mathematical logician [[Emil Post]] on formalizing [[Mathematical proof|proof]]. But \"few linguists are aware of this, because Post's papers are not cited.\"<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/> Pullum adds that the use of formal [[axiomatic system]]s to generate probable sentences in language in a [[Top-down parsing|top-down]] manner was first proposed by [[Zellig Harris]] in 1947, ten years before the publication of ''Syntactic Structures''. This is downplayed in ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/>\n;Necessity of transformations\nIn 1982, Pullum and another British linguist [[Gerald Gazdar]] argued that Chomsky's criticisms of [[Context-free grammar|context-free phrase structure grammar]] in ''Syntactic Structures'' are either mathematically flawed or based on incorrect assessments of the empirical data. They stated that a purely phrase structure treatment of grammar can explain linguistic phenomena better than one that uses transformations.<ref>{{harvnb|Pullum|Gazdar|1982}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Versions of such non-transformational phrase structure grammars include [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG), [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG) and [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG).</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nIn 2000, [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Cognitive Sciences compiled a list of the 100 most influential works in [[cognitive science]] from the 20th century.

The central concepts of the model however follow from [[Louis Hjelmslev |Louis Hjelmslev's]] book ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'' which was published in 1943 in Danish and followed by an English translation by Francis J.

First, it functions as a descriptive device, or as Hjelmslev explains it:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"We demand for example from the theory of language that it allow to describe correctly and exhaustively not only such given French text, but also all existing French texts, and not only these but also all possible and conceivable French texts\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelmslev |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Hjelmslev |date=1971 |orig-year=1943 |title=Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes \u00e0 une th\u00e9orie du langage |quote= Nous exigeons par exemple de la th\u00e9orie du langage qu\u2019elle permettre de d\u00e9crire non contradictoirement et exhaustivement non seulement tel texte fran\u00e7ais donn\u00e9, mais aussi tous les textes fran\u00e7ais existant, et non seulement ceux-ci mais encore tous les textes fran\u00e7ais possibles et concevables |location=Paris |publisher=Les \u00e9ditions de minuit |page=27 |isbn= 2707301345}}</ref>|author= }}\nWhen this work is done to a satisfactory level, it will also become possible to predict all the grammatical sentences of a given language:\n{{Quote|text=\n\u201cThanks to the linguistic knowledge thus acquired, we will be able to construct, for the same language, all conceivable or theoretically possible texts.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelmslev |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Hjelmslev |date=1971 |orig-year=1943 |title=Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes \u00e0 une th\u00e9orie du langage |quote= Gr\u00e2ce aux connaissances linguistiques ainsi acquises, nous pourrons construire, pour une m\u00eame langue, tous les textes concevables ou th\u00e9oriquement possibles. |location=Paris |publisher=Les \u00e9ditions de minuit |page=27 |isbn= 2707301345}}</ref>|author= }}\nHjelmslev also points out that an algorithmic description of a language could generate an infinite number of products from a finite number of primitive elements:<ref name=Seuren_1998 /> \n{{Quote|text=\n\"When we compare the inventories yielded at the various stages of the deduction, their size will usually turn out to decrease as the procedure goes on.

Hjelmslev was a [[structuralism | structuralist]] and applied mathematical models to [[Ferdinand de Saussure | Ferdinand de Saussure's]] concept of language as an interactive system of meaning and form. Although the [[Leonard Bloomfield | Bloomfieldian]] school of early to mid-20th century linguists were nicknamed 'American structuralists', they essentially rejected the basic tenets of structuralism: that linguistic form is explained through meaning, and that linguistics belongs to the domain of [[sociology]].<ref name=Seuren_1998 /><ref name=Joseph_2002 /><ref name=Tomalin_2006 />\n\nInstead, the idea of language endorsed by Leonard Bloomfield and his followers derived from [[William Wundt |William Wundt's]] [[mentalism (psychology) |mentalistic psychology]] which was replaced by [[behavioural psychology]] in Bloomfield's 1933 book ''Language''. This led to the separation of syntax from semantics as not an observable link in a [[stimulus\u2013response]] chain. Chomsky, like Harris and other American linguists, agreed that there is no causal link from semantics to syntax.<ref name=Seuren_1998 />\n\nDespite the paradigm shift, American linguists maintained Wundt's syntactic analysis which entails the placement of the [[object (grammar) | grammatical object]] into the [[verb phrase]]. They believed that languages should be analysed based on how native speakers feel is right. How to translate this idea into a scientific statement remained a vexing issue in American linguistics for decades.<ref name=Seuren_1998 /> Harris and [[Rulon Wells]] justified analysing the object as part of the verb phrase per 'economy'; but this term, again, merely suggested the perceived 'easiness' of the practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Rulon S. |date=1947 |title=Immediate constituents |journal=Language |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=81\u2013117 |doi= 10.2307/410382|jstor=410382 }}</ref>\n\nIn Syntactic Structures, Chomsky changes the meaning of Hjelmslev's principle of ''arbitrariness'' which meant that the generative calculus is merely a tool for the linguist and not a structure in reality.<ref name=Seuren_1998 /><ref name=Hjelmslev_1969 /> [[David Lightfoot (linguist) |David Lightfoot]] however points out in his introduction to the second edition that there were few points of true interest in Syntactic Structures itself, and the eventual interpretations that the rules or structures are 'cognitive', innate, or biological would have been made elsewhere, especially in the context of a debate between Chomsky and the advocates of behaviourism.<ref name=Lightfoot_2002>{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=David W. |year=2002  |chapter=Introduction to the second edition of Syntactic Structures by Noam Chomsky | chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/4073170 |chapter-format= |editor-last=Lightfoot |editor-first=David W. |editor-link=David Lightfoot (linguist) |title=Syntactic Structures |edition=second |location=Berlin |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |pages=v-xviii |isbn=3110172798  |access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> But decades later Chomsky makes the clear statement that syntactic structures, including the object as a dependent of the verb phrase, are caused by a genetic [[mutation]] in humans.<ref name=Berwick&Chomsky_2015>{{cite book |last1=Berwick|first1=Robert C. |last2=Chomsky|first2=Noam | title=Why Only Us: Language and Evolution|publisher=MIT Press |date=2015  |isbn=9780262034241| author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Chomsky as a young linguist===\n[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky, the author of ''Syntactic Structures'' (1977 photo)]]\nChomsky's interest in language started at an early age.

He places emphasis on \"rigorous formulations\" and \"precisely constructed models\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|loc=Preface}}</ref> In the first chapter of the book, he gives a definition of human language [[syntax]]. He then talks about the goals of syntactic study. For Chomsky, a linguist's goal is to build a [[grammar]] of a language. He defines grammar as a device which produces all the sentences of the language under study. Secondly, a linguist must find the abstract concepts beneath grammars to develop a general method. This method would help select the best possible device or grammar for any language given its [[Speech corpus|corpus]]. Finally, a linguistic theory must give a satisfactory description of all the levels of language analysis. Examples of these levels include [[phonology|sounds]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|words]] and [[syntax|sentence structures]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=5&ndash;6}}</ref>\n\n===Grammaticality===\n{{See also|Grammaticality|Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}}\n[[File:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|400px|A tree diagram of the sentence \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\"]]\nThe second chapter is titled \"The Independence of Grammar\". In it, Chomsky states that a language is \"a set ... of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements\". A linguist should separate the \"grammatical sequences\" or sentences of a language from the \"ungrammatical sequences\".<ref name=\"ss\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=13}}</ref> By a \"grammatical\" sentence Chomsky means a sentence that is intuitively \"acceptable to a native speaker\".<ref name=\"ss\" /> It is a sentence pronounced with a \"normal sentence intonation\". It is also \"recall[ed] much more quickly\" and \"learn[ed] much more easily\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=16}}</ref>\n\nChomsky then analyzes further about the basis of \"grammaticality.\" He shows three ways that do ''not'' determine whether a sentence is grammatical or not. First, a grammatical sentence need not be included in a corpus. Secondly, it need not be meaningful. Finally, it does not have to be statistically probable. Chomsky shows all three points using a nonsensical sentence \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=15}}</ref> He writes that the sentence is instinctively \"grammatical\" to a native English speaker. But it is not included in any known corpus at the time and is neither meaningful nor [[Probability distribution|statistically probable]].\n\nChomsky concludes that \"grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning.\" He adds that \"probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure.\"<ref name=\"ChomSynAuto\" />\n\n====Carnap's influence====\nBritish linguist Marcus Tomalin stated that a version of \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" was suggested decades earlier by [[Rudolf Carnap]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tomalin|2002}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rebuschi|2001|p=2014}}</ref> This German philosopher offered in 1934 the pseudo-sentence \"Piroten karulieren elatisch\".<ref>{{harvnb|Carnap|1934|p=2}}</ref> According to American linguist Reese Heitner, Carnap's sentence showed the autonomy of both syntactic and phonological structures.<ref group=\"note\">According to {{harvnb|Heitner|2005}}: \"[Carnap's sentence] actually does the double duty of demonstrating the \"autonomy\" of syntactic and phonological structure, an indication that not only can sentences be recognized as syntactically well-formed, but individual words can also be recognized as phonologically well-formed independent of semantics.\"</ref>\n\n===Grammar models and transformations===\n{{See also|Transformational grammar}}\nIn the third chapter titled \"An Elementary Linguistic Theory\", Chomsky tries to determine what sort of device or model gives an adequate account of a given set of \"grammatical\" sentences.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=18}}</ref> Chomsky hypothesizes that this device has to be finite instead of infinite. He then considers [[finite state grammar]], a [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication|communication theoretic]] model<ref group=\"note\">Specifically, the model proposed in {{harvnb|Shannon|Weaver|1949}}</ref> which treats language as a [[Markov process]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=19&ndash;21}}</ref> Then in the fourth chapter titled \"Phrase Structure\", he discusses [[phrase structure grammar]], a model based on [[immediate constituent analysis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=26&ndash;33}}</ref> In the fifth chapter titled \"Limitations of Phrase Structure Description\", he claims to show that both these models are inadequate for the purpose of linguistic description. As a solution, he introduces [[transformational generative grammar]] (TGG), \"a more powerful model&nbsp;... that might remedy these inadequacies.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\"/>\n[[File:Chomsky-Syntactic-Structures-Grammar-Model.jpg|thumb|400px|The grammar model discussed in Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' (1957)]]\nChomsky's transformational grammar has three parts: [[phrase structure rule]]s, [[transformational rules]] and [[Morphophonemics|morphophonemic]] rules.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 45\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=45}}</ref> The phrase structure rules are used for expanding [[Lexical category|grammatical categories]] <!-- Here grammatical category is actually lexical category--> and for substitutions. These yield a string of [[morpheme]]s. A transformational rule \"operates on a given string&nbsp;... with a given constituent structure and converts it into a new string with a new derived constituent structure.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 44\"/> It \"may rearrange strings or may add or delete morphemes.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 46\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=46}}</ref> Transformational rules are of two kinds: obligatory or optional. Obligatory transformations applied on the \"terminal strings\" of the grammar produce the \"kernel of the language\".<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 45\"/> Kernel sentences are simple, active, declarative and affirmative sentences. To produce passive, negative, interrogative or complex sentences, one or more optional transformation rules must be applied in a particular order to the kernel sentences. At the final stage of the grammar, morphophonemic rules convert a string of words into a string of [[phoneme]]s.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957 46\"/> Chomsky then applies this idea of transformational rules in the [[English language|English]] [[auxiliary verb]] system.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=38&ndash;40}}</ref>\n\n====Borrowing of terminology====\nIn ''Syntactic Structures'', the term \"transformation\" was borrowed from the works of [[Zellig Harris]]. Harris was Chomsky's initial mentor. Harris used the term \"transformation\" to describe equivalence relations between sentences of a language. By contrast, Chomsky's used the term to describe a formal rule applied to underlying structures of sentences.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2008|pp=66&ndash;67}}</ref>\n\nChomsky also borrowed the term \"generative\" from a previous work of mathematician [[Emil Post]].<ref group=\"note\">In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}, Chomsky writes that he was \"following a familiar technical use of the term \"generate,\" cf. {{harvnb|Post|1944}}\". In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=9}}, Chomksy justifies his choice of the term \"generate\", writing that \"the term 'generate' is familiar in the sense intended here in logic, particularly in Post's theory of combinatorial systems. Furthermore, 'generate' seems to be the most appropriate translation for Humboldt's term ''erzeugen'', which he frequently uses, it seems, in essentially the sense here intended. Since this use of the term 'generate' is well established both in logic and in the tradition of linguistic theory.\"</ref> Post wanted to \"mechanically [derive] inferences from an initial axiomatic sentence\".<ref>{{harvnb|Post|1943}},  {{harvnb|Post|1944}} and  {{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}</ref> Chomsky applied Post's work on [[logical inference]] to describe sets of [[String (computer science)|string]]s (sequence of letters or sounds) of a human language. When he says a finite set of rules \"generate\" (i.e. \"recursively enumerate\"<ref>{{harvnb|Pullum|Scholz|2001}}</ref>) the set of potentially infinite number of sentences of a particular human language, he means that they provide an explicit, structural description of those sentences.<ref group=\"note\">In {{harvnb|Chomsky|1965|p=8}}, Chomsky writes that \"by a generative grammar I mean simply a system of rules that in some explicit and well-defined way assigns structural descriptions to sentences.\"</ref>\n\n===Justification of grammars===\nIn the sixth chapter titled \"On the Goals of Linguistic Theory\", Chomsky writes that his \"fundamental concern\" is \"the problem of justification of grammars\".<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\"/> He draws parallels between the theory of language and theories in [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]]. He compares a finite [[Speech corpus|corpus]] of [[utterance]]s of a particular language to \"[[observation]]s\". He likens grammatical rules to \"[[Physical law|laws]]\" which are stated in terms of \"hypothetical constructs\" such as [[phoneme]]s, [[phrase]]s, etc.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1957: 49\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=49}}</ref> According to Chomsky, the criteria for the \"justification of grammars\" are \"external conditions of adequacy\", the \"condition of generality\" and \"simplicity\". To choose the best possible grammar for a given corpus of a given language, Chomsky shows his preference for the \"evaluation procedure\" (which uses the aforementioned criteria). He rejects the \"discovery procedure\"<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=55}} writes: \"Our main point is that a linguistic theory should not be identified with a manual of useful procedures, nor should it be expected to provide mechanical procedures for the discovery of grammars\"</ref> (employed in [[structural linguistics]] and supposed to automatically and mechanically produce the correct grammar of a language from a corpus<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|pp=76}} notes that \"the fullest and most interesting expression of 'discovery procedure' is [the] book ''Methods in Structural Linguistics'' ({{harvnb|Harris|1951}}) by Zellig Harris, Chomsky's mentor.</ref>). He also dismisses the \"decision procedure\" (supposed to automatically choose the best grammar for a language from a set of competing grammars).<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=49&ndash;56}}</ref> Chomsky thus shows preference for \"explanatory depth\" with some \"empirical inadequacies\" over the pursuit of very detailed empirical coverage of all data.<ref group=\"note\">See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1978|pp=9\u201310}}. Chomsky characterized this approach as the \"Galilean Style\" of inquiry which had already been applied in modern natural sciences with \"great success\" since the 17th century.</ref>\n\n===Application of transformational grammar in English===\nIn the seventh chapter titled \"Some Transformations in English\", Chomsky strictly applies his just-proposed transformation-based approach on some aspects of English. He treats at length the formation of [[English language|English]] [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] [[Passive voice|passive]] sentences, yes-no and wh- [[Interrogative word|interrogative]] sentences, etc. He claims in the end that transformational analysis can describe \"a wide variety of&nbsp;... distinct phenomena\" in English grammar in a \"simple\", \"natural\" and \"orderly\" way.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=68}} states:\"a wide variety of apparently distinct phenomena [in English language] all fall into place in a very simple and natural way when we adopt the viewpoint of transformational analysis and that, consequently, the grammar of English becomes much more simple and orderly.\"</ref>\n\n===Constructional homonymity and distinct levels of linguistic analysis===\nIn the eighth chapter titled \"The explanatory power of linguistic theory\", Chomsky writes a linguistic theory cannot content itself by just  generating valid grammatical sentences. It also has to account for other structural phenomena at different levels of linguistic representation. At a certain linguistic level, there can be two items which can be understood having different meanings but they are structurally indistinguishable within that level. This is called a \u201cconstructional homonymity\u201d [sic]. The relevant ambiguity can be resolved by establishing a higher level of linguistic analysis. At this higher level, the two items can be clearly shown having two different structural interpretations. In this way, constructional homonymities at the phonemic level can be resolved by establishing the level of morphology, and so forth. One of the motivation of establishing a distinct, higher level of linguistic analysis is, then, to explain the structural ambiguity due to the constructional homonymities at a lower level. On the other hand, each linguistic level also captures some structural similarities within the level that are not explained in lower levels. Chomsky uses this argument as well to motivate the establishment of distinct levels of linguistic analysis.<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=85\u201387}}</ref>\n\nChomsky then shows that a grammar which analyzes sentences up to the phrase structure level contains many constructional homonymities at the phrase structure level where the resulting ambiguities need to be explained at a higher level. Then he shows how his newly invented \u201ctransformational level\u201d can naturally and successfully function as that higher level. He further claims that any phrase structure grammar which cannot explain these ambiguities as successfully as transformational grammar does must be considered \"inadequate\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=91}}</ref>\n\n===Role of semantics in syntax===\nIn the ninth chapter titled \"Syntax and Semantics\", Chomsky reminds that his analysis so far has been \"completely [[Formal language|formal]] and non-semantic.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=93}}</ref> He then offers many counterexamples to refute some common linguistic assertions about grammar's reliance on [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. He concludes that the correspondence between meaning and grammatical form is \"imperfect\", \"inexact\" and \"vague.\" Consequently, it is \"relatively useless\" to use meaning \"as a basis for grammatical description\".<ref>{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=101}}</ref> To support his point, Chomsky considers a similar relation between semantics and [[phonology]]. He shows that in order to build a theory of [[Phoneme|phonemic]] distinction based on meaning would entail \"complex\", \"exhaustive\" and \"laborious investigation\" of an \"immense\", \"vast [[Speech corpus|corpus]]\".<ref name=\"chomcorp\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|pp=96&ndash;97}}</ref> By contrast, phonemic distinctness can be easily explained in a \"straightforward\" way and in \"completely non-semantic terms\" with the help of \"pair tests\".<ref name=\"chomcorp\" /> Chomsky also claims that a strictly formal, non-semantic framework of syntactic theory might ultimately be useful to support a parallel independent semantic theory.<ref group=\"note\">Because it would \"reveal\" insights about sentence structures. See {{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=103}}</ref>\n\n==Rhetorical style==\nRandy Allen Harris, a specialist of the [[rhetoric of science]], writes that ''Syntactic Structures'' \"appeals calmly and insistently to a new conception\" of linguistic science. He finds the book \"lucid, convincing, syntactically daring, the calm voice of reason&nbsp;... [speaking] directly to the imagination and ambition of the entire field.\" It also bridged the \"rhetorical gulf\" to make the message of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (a highly abstract, mathematically dense, and \"forbiddingly technical\" work) more palatable to the wider field of linguists.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1993|loc=Chapter 3}}</ref> In a more detailed examination of the book, Harris finds Chomsky's argumentation in ''Syntactic Structures'' \"multilayered and compelling\". Chomsky not only makes a logical appeal (i.e. [[logos]]) to a highly formalized model of language, but also appeals explicitly and tacitly to the [[Ethos#Rhetoric|ethos]] of science.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|1989}}</ref>\n\nIn particular, Chomsky\u2019s analysis of the complex English auxiliary verb system in ''Syntactic Structures'' had great rhetorical effect. It combined simple phrase structure rules with a simple transformational rule. This treatment was based entirely on formal simplicity. Various linguists have described it as \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cpowerful\u201d, \u201celegant\u201d, \u201crevealing\u201d, \u201cinsightful\u201d, \u201cbeguiling\u201d and \u201cingenious\u201d.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}} wrote that \u201c[Chomsky\u2019s] examples of defects of phrase structure grammar were illustrated simultaneously with the demonstration that grammars containing the more powerful transformational rules can handle the same phenomena in an elegant and revealing manner.\u201d</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to {{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=188}}, \"this apparently curious analysis is rather ingenious\" and \"the powerful tool of different levels of structure related by transformations was particularly beguiling, since  transformations appeared to offer a means of explaining the often amazingly complex relationships between the forms of sentences and their understanding.\"</ref><ref group=\"note\">In his introduction to ''Syntactic Structures'' ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1957|p=ix}}), American linguist David Lightfoot wrote that \"this ingenious transformation...avoided hopelessly complex phrase structure rules and yielded an elegant account... \u201d</ref> According to American linguist Frederick Newmeyer, this particular analysis won many \u201csupporters for Chomsky\u201d and \u201cimmediately led to some linguists\u2019 proposing generative-transformational analysis of particular phenomena\u201d.<ref>{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1987|p=24}}</ref> According to British linguist E. Keith Brown, \"the elegance and insightfulness of this account was instantly recognized, and this was an important factor in ensuring the initial success of the transformational way of looking at syntax.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2010|p=186}}</ref> American linguist Mark Aronoff wrote that this \u201cbeautiful analysis and description of some very striking facts was the rhetorical weapon that drove the acceptance of [Chomsky\u2019s] theory\u201d. He added that in Chomsky\u2019s treatment of English verbs, \u201cthe convergence of theory and analysis provide a description of facts so convincing that it changed the entire field\u201d.<ref>{{harvnb|Aronoff|2014}}</ref>\n\nRaymond Oenbring, a doctorate in the rhetoric of science, thinks that Chomsky \"overstates the novelty\" of transformational rules. He \"seems to take all the credit for them\" even though a version of them had already been introduced by [[Zellig Harris]] in a previous work. He writes that Chomsky himself was \"cautious\" to \"display deference\" to prevailing linguistic research. His enthusiastic followers such as [[Robert Lees (linguist)|Lees]] were, by contrast, much more \"confrontational\". They sought to drive a \"rhetorical wedge\" between Chomsky's work and that of post-Bloomfieldians (i.e. American linguists in the 1940s et 1950s), arguing that the latter does not qualify as linguistic \"science\".<ref>{{harvnb|Oenbring|2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Impact on linguistics===\nIn an early review of the book, American structural linguist [[Charles F. Voegelin]] wrote that ''Syntactic Structures'' posed a fundamental challenge to the established way of doing linguistic research. He stated that it had the potential to accomplish \"a [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]]\" within linguistics.<ref>{{harvnb|Voegelin|1958}}</ref> Another American linguist [[Martin Joos]] called the Chomskyan brand of linguistic theory a \"heresy\" within the [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfieldian]] tradition.<ref>{{harvnb|Joos|1961}}</ref> These early remarks proved to be prescient. American linguist [[Paul Postal]] commented in 1964 that most of the \"syntactic conceptions prevalent in the United States\" were \"versions of the theory of [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the sense of Chomsky\".<ref>{{harvnb|Postal|1964}}</ref> By 1965, linguists were saying that  ''Syntactic Structures'' had \"mark[ed] an epoch\",<ref>{{harvnb|Levin|1965|p=92}}</ref> had a \"startling impact\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bach|1965|pp=111&ndash;12}}</ref> and created a [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhnian]] \"revolution\".<ref>{{harvnb|Thorne|1965|p=74}}</ref> British linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] wrote in 1966 that \"no work has had a greater influence upon the current linguistic theory than Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lyons|1966}}</ref> British historian of linguistics [[R. H. Robins]] wrote in 1967 that the publication of Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' was \"probably the most radical and important change in direction in [[descriptive linguistics]] and in linguistic theory that has taken place in recent years\".<ref>{{harvnb|Robins|1967|p=226}}</ref>\n\nAnother historian of linguistics [[Frederick Newmeyer]] considers ''Syntactic Structures'' \"revolutionary\" for two reasons. Firstly, it showed that a [[Formal language|formal]] yet non-[[Empiricism|empiricist]] theory of language was possible. Chomsky demonstrated this possibility in a practical sense by formally treating a fragment of [[English grammar]]. Secondly, it put [[syntax]] at the center of the theory of language. Syntax was recognized as the focal point of language production, in which a finite set of rules can produce an infinite number of sentences. Subsequently, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (i.e. the study of structure and formation of words) and [[phonology]] (i.e. the study of organization of sounds in languages) were relegated in importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Newmeyer|1996|pp=24&ndash;26}}</ref>\n\nAmerican linguist Norbert Hornstein wrote that before ''Syntactic Structures'', linguistic research was overly preoccupied with creating hierarchies and categories of all observable language data. One of the \"lasting contributions\" of  ''Syntactic Structures'' is that it shifted the linguistic research methodology to abstract, rationalist theory-making based on contacts with data, which is the \"common scientific practice\".<ref>{{cite web | title=On Syntactic Structures | website=Faculty of Language| author = Norbert Hornstein |date = 27 January 2017 | url=http://facultyoflanguage.blogspot.com/2017/01/on-syntactic-structures.html | accessdate=18 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Impact on other disciplines===\n;Psychology\nThe generative grammar of ''Syntactic Structures'' heralded Chomsky's [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] perspective in linguistic analysis. Shortly after its publication, in 1959, Chomsky wrote a critical review<ref name=\"Chomsky 1959\">{{harvnb|Chomsky|1959}}</ref> of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Skinner|1957}}</ref> Skinner had presented the [[Language acquisition|acquisition]] of human language in terms of conditioned responses to outside [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and [[reinforcement]]. Chomsky opposed this [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] model. He argued that humans produce language using separate syntactic and semantic components inside the [[mind]]. He presented the generative grammar as a coherent abstract description of this underlying [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] reality.<ref name=\"Chomsky 1959\"/> Chomsky's argument had a forceful impact on psycholinguistic research. It changed the course of the discipline in the following years.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"BehavCritic\">According to {{harvnb|Steinberg|Hiroshi|Aline|2013|p=371}}: \"[Chomsky's generative system of rules] was more powerful that anything&nbsp;... psycholinguists had heretofore had at their disposal. [It] was of special interest to these theorists. Many psychologists were quick to attribute generative systems to the minds of speakers and quick to abandon&nbsp;... Behaviorism.\"</ref>\n;Philosophy\n''Syntactic Structures'' initiated an interdisciplinary dialog between [[Philosophy of language|philosophers of language]] and linguists. American philosopher [[John Searle]] called it a \"remarkable intellectual achievement\" of its time. He compared the book \"to the work of [[Keynes]] or [[Freud]]\". He credited it with producing not only a \"revolution in linguistics\", but also having a \"revolutionary effect\" on \"[[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]\".<ref name=\"Searle 1972\"/> Chomsky and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], a stridently anti-mentalistic philosopher of language, debated many times on the merit of Chomsky's linguistic theories.<ref>{{harvnb|Quine|1969}}</ref> Many philosophers supported Chomsky's idea that natural languages are [[Psychological nativism#Language|innate]] and syntactically rule-governed. They also believed in the existence of rules in the human mind which bind meanings to [[utterance]]s. The investigation of these rules started a new era in [[philosophical semantics]].<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Stokhof|2012|p=548}} writes: \"That natural languages are indeed not systematic enough to allow formal treatment&nbsp;... is&nbsp;... a complaint that has been leveled against natural languages by philosophers for centuries. The work of Chomsky in generative linguistics apparently inspired much more confidence in philosophers and logicians to assert that perhaps natural languages weren't as unsystematic and misleading as their philosophical predecessors had made them out to be&nbsp;... at the end of 1960s formal semantics began to flourish.\"</ref><ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Davidson|1967}} writes: \"Recent work by Chomsky and others is doing much to bring the complexities of natural languages within the scope of serious semantic theory\".</ref>\n;Computer science\nWith its formal and logical treatment of language, ''Syntactic Structures'' also brought linguistics and the new field of [[computer science]] closer together. Computer scientist [[Donald Knuth]] (winner of the [[Turing Award]]) recounted that he read ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1961 and was influenced by it.<ref group=\"note\">From the preface of {{harvnb|Knuth|2003}}: \"...&nbsp;researchers in linguistics were beginning to formulate rules of grammar that were considerably more mathematical than before. And people began to realize that such methods are highly relevant to the artificial languages that were becoming popular for computer programming, even though natural languages like English remained intractable. I found the mathematical approach to grammar immediately appealing\u2014so much so, in fact, that I must admit to taking a copy of Noam Chomsky's ''Syntactic Structures'' along with me on my honeymoon in 1961. During odd moments, while crossing the Atlantic in an ocean liner and while camping in Europe, I read that book rather thoroughly and tried to answer some basic theoretical questions. Here was a marvelous thing: a mathematical theory of language in which I could use a computer programmer's intuition! The mathematical, linguistic, and algorithmic parts of my life had previously been totally separate. During the ensuing years those three aspects became steadily more intertwined; and by the end of the 1960s I found myself a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, primarily because of work that I had done with respect to languages for computer programming.\"</ref> Chomsky's \"Three models\" paper ({{harvnb|Chomsky|1956}}), published a year prior to the ''Syntactic Structures'' and containing many of its ideas, was crucial to the development of the theory of [[formal languages]] within computer science.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Boden|2006|p=648}} writes:\"[Papers like the \"Three Models\"] had a huge, lasting influence on pure computer science\" and that they are cited in \"virtually every introduction to compiler design\". {{harvnb|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=9}} states that \"Chomsky's notion of a context-free grammar&nbsp;... has aided immensely the specification of programming languages.\"</ref>\n;Neuroscience\nIn 2011, a group of French neuroscientists conducted research to verify if actual brain mechanisms worked in the way that Chomsky suggested in ''Syntactic Structures''. The results suggested that specific regions of the brain handle syntactic information in an abstract way. These are independent from other brain regions that handle semantic information. Moreover, the brain analyzes not just mere strings of words, but hierarchical structures of constituents. These observations validated the theoretical claims of Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pallier|Devauchelle|Dehaene|2011|pp=2522&ndash;2527}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Neuroscience|neuroscientists]] at [[New York University]] conducted experiments to verify if the human brain uses \"hierarchical structure building\" for processing languages. They measured the magnetic and electric activities in the brains of participants. The results showed that \"[human] brains distinctly tracked three components of the phrases they heard.\" This   \"[reflected] a hierarchy in our [[Neurolinguistics|neural processing]] of linguistic structures: words, phrases, and then sentences\u2014at the same time.\" These results bore out Chomsky's hypothesis in ''Syntactic Structures'' of an \"internal grammar mechanism\" inside the brain.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chomsky Was Right, NYU Researchers Find: We Do Have a \"Grammar\" in Our Head | website=New York University | url=http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/december/chomsky-was-right-nyu-researchers-find-we-do-have-a-grammar-in-our-head.html | accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\n;Erroneous idealization\nIn his 1964 presidential address to the [[Linguistic Society of America]], American linguist [[Charles Hockett]] considered ''Syntactic Structures'' one of \"only four major breakthroughs in modern linguistics\".<ref name=\"hockett\">{{harvnb|Hockett|1965|p=185}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">The other three are [[Sir William Jones]]'s address to the Asiatic Society in 1786, [[Karl Verner]]'s ''Eine Ausnahme der ersten Lautverschiebung'' in 1875 and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de Linguistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]'' in 1916.</ref> But he rapidly turned into a fierce critic of Chomskyan linguistics. By 1966, Hockett rejected \"[Chomsky's] frame of reference in almost every detail\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hockett|1966|p=156}}</ref> In his 1968 book ''The State of the Art'', Hockett writes that Chomsky's main [[fallacy]] is that he treats language as a [[Formal science|formal]], well-defined, stable system and proceeds from this idealized [[abstraction]]. Hockett believes such an idealization is not possible. He claims that there is no [[Empiricism|empirical evidence]] that our [[language faculty]] is, in reality, a well-defined underlying system. The sources that give rise to language faculty in humans, e.g. physical [[genetic transmission]] and cultural transmission, are themselves poorly defined.<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|p=83}} states:  \"we must not promote our more or less standardized by-and-large characterization of the language to the status of a monolithic ideal, nor infer that because we can achieve a fixed characterization some such monolithic ideal exists, in the lap of [[God]] or in the brain of each individual speaker.\"</ref> Hockett also opposed Chomsky's hypothesis that syntax is completely independent of the study of meaning.<ref>{{harvnb|Hockett|1968|pp=67\u201371}}</ref>\n;Non-empiricism\nContrary to Hockett, British linguist [[Geoffrey Sampson]] thought that Chomsky's assumptions about a well-defined grammaticality are \"[justified] in practice.\" It brought syntax \"within the purview of scientific description\". He considers it a \"great positive contribution to the discipline\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|1980|p=134}}</ref> However, he maintains that Chomsky's linguistics is overly \"[[intuition]]-based\". For him, it relies too much on native speakers' subjective [[Introspection|introspective]] judgments about their own language. Consequently, language data empirically observed by impersonal third parties are given less importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=5}}, {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=10}} and {{harvnb|Sampson|2001|p=13}}</ref> \n;Influence of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''\nAccording to Sampson, ''Syntactic Structures'' largely owes its good fortune of becoming the dominant theoretical paradigm in the following years to the charisma of Chomsky's intellect. Sampson writes that there are many references in ''Syntactic Structures'' to Chomsky's own ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (LSLT) in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but ''LSLT'' was not widely available in print for decades. Nevertheless, Sampson's argument runs, ''Syntactic Structures'', albeit \"sketchy\", derived its \"aura of respectability\" from ''LSLT'' lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref name=\"Sampson 2001 152\"/> In the view of British-American linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]], ''Syntactic Structures'' boldly claims that \"it is impossible, not just difficult\" for finite-state devices to generate all grammatical sentences of English, and then alludes to ''LSLT'' for the \"rigorous proof\" of this. But in reality, ''LSLT'' does not contain a valid, convincing proof dismissing finite-state devices.<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\">{{harvnb|Pullum|2011}}</ref>\n;Originality\nPullum also remarks that the \"originality\" of ''Syntactic Structures'' is \"highly overstated\". For him, it \"does not properly credit the earlier literature on which it draws\".<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/> He shows in detail how the approach in ''Syntactic Structures'' goes directly back to the work of the mathematical logician [[Emil Post]] on formalizing [[Mathematical proof|proof]]. But \"few linguists are aware of this, because Post's papers are not cited.\"<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/> Pullum adds that the use of formal [[axiomatic system]]s to generate probable sentences in language in a [[Top-down parsing|top-down]] manner was first proposed by [[Zellig Harris]] in 1947, ten years before the publication of ''Syntactic Structures''. This is downplayed in ''Syntactic Structures''.<ref name=\"Pullum 2011\"/>\n;Necessity of transformations\nIn 1982, Pullum and another British linguist [[Gerald Gazdar]] argued that Chomsky's criticisms of [[Context-free grammar|context-free phrase structure grammar]] in ''Syntactic Structures'' are either mathematically flawed or based on incorrect assessments of the empirical data. They stated that a purely phrase structure treatment of grammar can explain linguistic phenomena better than one that uses transformations.<ref>{{harvnb|Pullum|Gazdar|1982}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Versions of such non-transformational phrase structure grammars include [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG), [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG) and [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG).</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nIn 2000, [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Cognitive Sciences compiled a list of the 100 most influential works in [[cognitive science]] from the 20th century.
