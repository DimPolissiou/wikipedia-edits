It was released on 7 November 2014, through [[Polydor Records]]. Following a slew of media invasion, Cheryl took a one-year hiatus from music. Following her hiatus, Cheryl confirmed that [[Girls Aloud]] would reunite and release a greatest hits compilation. After its release, the group embarked on their last tour and announced their permanent split. In July 2013 Cheryl began recording ''Only Human''; the recording was later completed in August 2014.\n\n''Only Human'' explores themes of being at peace with oneself, banishing bad influences and living life to the full. Musically, the album follows in the same vein as Cheryl's previous work, taking influence from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], however the album contains a diverse musical style ranging from the 1980s, [[disco]]-pop to [[Electro (music)|electro]]. The album's production is characterised as being sparsely-produced. Cheryl worked with a variety of writers and producers including frequent collaborators and new ones to create her desired sound, she also contributed a large amount of writing herself.\n\nThe album was preceded by lead single \"[[Crazy Stupid Love (song)|Crazy Stupid Love]]\", which featured British rapper [[Tinie Tempah]], released on 18 July 2014. The song debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming Cole's fourth number one single.<ref name=\"Cole Lands Fourth Number One (BBC News)\"/> The album's second single, \"[[I Don't Care (Cheryl song)|I Don't Care]]\", was released before the album on 31 October 2014 and became Cheryl's fifth number one making chart history as she is the first ever British female solo artist to have five number ones in the UK. The album was released on 16 February 2015 in the USA.<ref name=\"Cheryl Talks New Single (DS August 2014)\"/>  ''Only Human'' entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number seven.<ref name=\"Album Debut Position (OOC November 2014)\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nCheryl released her third studio album, ''[[A Million Lights]]'', on 18 June 2012.<ref name=\"New Album (DSpy April 2012)\"/> The album was supported with the release of the lead single, \"[[Call My Name (Cheryl song)|Call My Name]]\" (2012), which became Cheryl's third number one single on the UK Singles Chart, with the sales of 152,001 digital copies.

Cheryl commented, \"The song, when I first heard it, was just full of personality. The girl is a genius. I'm just glad I got the chance to work with her.\"<ref name=\"Sia Two Songs (Clickmusic June 2014)\"/>\n\nDuring the recording of the album Cheryl contributed to the album's writing, including: \"Bombs\", \"One Love\", \"We Could All Be Stars\", \"Throwback\" and \"Coming Up for Air\"<ref name=\"Penning New Album Tracks (Belfast Telegraph July 2014)\"/> ''Only Human''{{'}}s lead single was originally recorded by [[Kylie Minogue]] for her twelfth studio album ''[[Kiss Me Once]]'' (2014). She worked with Wilkins on the track and wanted it to be used on the album, but Minogue's management [[Roc Nation]] did not like it because it was \"too pop\". Wilkins later gave the track to Cheryl to record.<ref name=\"Kylie Crazy Stupid Love (Metro August 2014)\"/> Cheryl also worked with producers, such as [[Greg Kurstin]] and [[Invisible Men]] on songs for the album, as well as new producers, including [[Red Triangle (Red Triangle Productions)|Red Triangle]], [[Lucas Secon]] and Electric.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Composition ==\nThe album's lyrics explore themes of being at peace with oneself, banishing bad influences and living life to the full.<ref name=\"Album Review (Entertainmentwise November 2014)\"/> Musically, the album is a mid-tempo pop and R&B album with electro leanings that explores a variety of genres ranging from 80s style disco-pop to sparsely-produced contemporary songs.<ref name=\"Album Review (So So Gay November 2014)\"/> ''Only Human'' opens was an introduction of a speech from the philosopher [[Alan Watts]], the speech sees Watts discussing a profound dialogue that money doesn't equal happiness.<ref name=\"Album Review (DSpy November 2014)\"/> \"Live Life Now\" is an electronic dance song. Like the introduction, \"Live Life Now\" continues to sample Watts speech, while Cheryl sings lyrics about money and desires.<ref name=\"Album Review (DSpy November 2014)\"/> \"It's About Time\" lyrical revolves around Cheryl throwing \"barbs\" and a former lover. \"Crazy Stupid Love\" is a pop and dancey [[urban pop]] song built on a toe-tapping structure with plenty of saxophones and a \"la la la la la\" refrain.<ref name=\"Cheryl Announces New Single (Idolator May 2014)\"/><ref name=\"CSL Review (RFS July 2014)\"/><ref name=\"CSL Lyric Video (Idolator May 2014)\"/> Lyrically, the song has Cheryl gushing about her uncontrollable feelings for her boyfriend, with lyrics like.<ref name=\"Album Review (DSpy November 2014)\"/>\n\n\"I Don't Care\" is a pop and dance song which lyrically finds Cole singing \"It feels so fucking good to say, I swear that I don't care\".<ref name=\"Cheryl Is Unbothered (Idolator October 2014)\"/><ref name=\"Sweary New Single (HPost October 2014)\"/> [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] website editor Bianca Gracie noted that the song carries \"an 80s carefree vibe to it, thanks to the breezy synths and pumping bass line\", and in contrast to her other songs like \"[[Ghetto Baby]]\", there are no \"massive bass drops or an in-your-face dance theme\".<ref name=\"Cheryl Is Unbothered (Idolator October 2014)\"/> \"[[Only Human (Cheryl song)|Only Human]]\" is an electro-ballad, with vocals layered in the style of [[Imogen Heap]] according to Bradley Stern of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]], the song contains encouraging lyrics built over a glittering production.<ref name=\"Unveils Title Track (Idolator October 2014)\"/> \"Stars\" is a song Cheryl wrote for her fans, the song's lyrics are \"inspiring\" described by Stern of Idolator as \"bright and self-empowering\", \"Stars\" is an electronic song backed by shimmering and stomping production.<ref name=\"Stars (Idolator November 2014)\"/>\n\nAccording to Bradley Stern of [[MuuMuse]], \"All in One Night\" is a song described as is \"a slow-burning R&B song\" that is compared to Cheryl's song \"[[Ghetto Baby]]\" from her third studio album, ''A Million Lights'' (2012). \"Coming Up For Air\" featuring [[Joel Compass]], is described as the album's most \"adventurous\" song and \"carries just the vaguest hint of the creeping, skeletal production of BANKS and [[FKA Twigs]].\"<ref name=\"Album Review (Muumuse November 2014)\"/> \"Fight On\" is backed by a choir and pounding percussion, with ethereal, tribal beats and lyrically sees Cheryl telling the story of a girl seeking sanctuary.<ref name=\"Album Review (DSpy November 2014)\"/><ref name=\"Debut Song Fight On (Idolator November 2014)\"/>\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nDuring an appearance on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', Cheryl confirmed the album's title to be ''Only Human'', stating: \"I was exhausted, I'd had a solo tour and then toured with Girls Aloud so I took a year off to be with my family. It was the first time off I'd had in 10 years \u2013 it was a normal time. I did party a lot. I needed to let loose and it was the best thing I could do.

While both covers featured the same headshot of Cheryl, the editions differed in their design aspects; the standard cover shows the singer with [[leopard]] print makeup around her left eye, while the deluxe shows a stripe across her left eye that is torn away, to reveal a face of a leopard.<ref name=\"Album Cover (DS October 2014)\"/>\n\nCheryl and Tempah performed \"Crazy Stupid Love\" for the first time on the final of the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 8)|eighth series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' on 7 June 2014.<ref name=\"BGT Comeback Performance (DStar May 2014)\"/> Cole appeared on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'' on 20 June, and also performed the song as part of her set at [[Summertime Ball|Capital FM's Summertime Ball]] the following day, 21 June 2014.<ref name=\"Cole on Graham Norton (DSpy June 2014)\"/> As part of the [[iTunes]] pre-order, Cheryl allowed a download of the title track, \"Only Human\", for those who pre-ordered the album.

It was released on 7 November 2014, through [[Polydor Records]]. Following a slew of media invasion, Cheryl took a one-year hiatus from music. Following her hiatus, Cheryl confirmed that [[Girls Aloud]] would reunite and release a greatest hits compilation. After its release, the group embarked on their last tour and announced their permanent split. In July 2013 Cheryl began recording ''Only Human''; the recording was later completed in August 2014.\n\n''Only Human'' explores themes of being at peace with oneself, banishing bad influences and living life to the full. Musically, the album follows in the same vein as Cheryl's previous work, taking influence from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], however the album contains a diverse musical style ranging from the 1980s, [[disco]]-pop to [[Electro (music)|electro]]. The album's production is characterised as being sparsely-produced. Cheryl worked with a variety of writers and producers including frequent collaborators and new ones to create her desired sound, she also contributed a large amount of writing herself.\n\nThe album was preceded by lead single \"[[Crazy Stupid Love (song)|Crazy Stupid Love]]\", which featured British rapper [[Tinie Tempah]], released on 18 July 2014. The song debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming Cole's fourth number one single.<ref name=\"Cole Lands Fourth Number One (BBC News)\"/> The album's second single, \"[[I Don't Care (Cheryl song)|I Don't Care]]\", was released before the album on 31 October 2014 and became Cheryl's fifth number one making chart history as she is the first ever British female solo artist to have five number ones in the UK.

This is a list of such units invented by sources that are notable for reasons other than having made the unit itself, and that are widely known in the [[English language|anglophone]] world for their [[mathematical joke|humour value]].\n\nThese units may or may not have precise objectively measurable values, but all of them measure quantities that have been defined within the [[International System of Units]].\n\n==Systems==\n\n===FFF units===\n{{Main|FFF system}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!Unit || Dimension || Definition || SI Value\n|-\n| [[furlong]] || length\n|align=right| 660&nbsp;ft\n|align=right| 201.168 m\n|-\n| [[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]]{{efn|1=The firkin is normally a unit of volume equal to {{convert|9|impgal|L|spell=in}}. The \"firkin\" of the FFF system is the firkin of water, i.e. the ''mass'' of nine imperial gallons of water. The imperial gallon was originally based on the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|spell=in}} of water (under certain thermodynamic conditions). This gives us a water density of {{convert|10|lb/impgal|kg/L|0|spell=in}}. Using this as a basis of our calculation we obtain {{convert|90|lb|kg|spell=in}} for the firkin of water.<!-- Note that using the metric system's 1 kg/l assumption gives us a slightly greater firkin.-->}} || mass || {{convert|90|lb|abbr=on|disp=table|4}}\n|-\n| [[fortnight]] || time\n|align=right| 14 days\n|align=right| 1,209,600 s\n|}\n\nMost countries use the International System of Units ([[International System of Units|SI]]). In contrast, the [[furlong]]/[[English brewery cask units#Firkin|firkin]]/[[fortnight]] system of units of measurement draws attention by being extremely old fashioned and off-beat at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itotd.com/articles/2987/furlongs-per-fortnight/|title=Furlongs Per Fortnight &#124; Interesting Thing of the Day|first=Joe|last=Kissell|website=itotd.com}}</ref>\n\nOne furlong per fortnight is very nearly 1 centimetre per minute (to within 1 part in 400). Indeed, if the inch were defined as [[Repeating decimal|2.{{overline|54}}]] cm rather than 2.54&nbsp;cm exactly, it would be 1&nbsp;cm/min. Besides having the meaning of \"any obscure unit\", furlongs per fortnight have also served frequently in the classroom as an example on how to reduce a unit's fraction. The [[speed of light]] may be expressed as being roughly 1.8 terafurlongs per fortnight (or megafurlongs per microfortnight).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.google.com/search?q=c+in+furlongs+per+fortnight| title=c in furlongs per fortnight - Google Search| accessdate=2006-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| format=TXT| title=FAQ for newsgroup UK.rec.sheds, version 2&3/7th| year=2000| accessdate=2006-03-10| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306161426/http://www.uk-rec-sheds.org.uk/faq60.txt| archivedate=2006-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Great Underground Empire (Zork)===\nIn the [[Zork]] series of games, the Great Underground Empire had its own system of measurements, the most frequently referenced of which was the bloit. Defined as the distance the king's favorite pet could run in one hour (spoofing a popular legend about the history of the [[foot (length)|foot]]), the length of the bloit varied dramatically, but the one canonical conversion to real-world units puts it at approximately two-thirds of a [[mile]] (1 [[km]]).{{efn|1=Dimwit Flathead defoliated the Fublio Valley to make a huge statue of himself. The literature for ''Zork'' described the area defoliated as 400,000 acres, whereas that for ''Zork Zero'' gives the area as 1,400 square bloits, which would be equal to 625 square miles. This would define the bloit as 0.668 mile, 3,527.8 feet, or 1.075 km.}} Liquid volume was measured in gloops, and temperature in degrees Q (57 \u00b0Q is said to be the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water).<ref>''Encyclopedia Frobozzica'', Infocom, 1993.</ref>\n\n===Potrzebie===\nIn issue 33, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' published a partial table of the \"[[Potrzebie]] System of Weights and Measures\" developed by 19-year-old [[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]], later a famed [[computer science|computer scientist]]. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of ''Mad'' issue 26, or 2.263348517438173216473&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2008/01/15/the-potrzebie-system-of-weights-and-measures/ |title=The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures |publisher=Neatorama.com |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>\n\nVolume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in [[blintz]] (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of [[halva]], which is \"a form of pie [with] a [[Relative density|specific gravity]] of [[Pi|3.1416]] and a specific heat of .31416\"), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average earth rotation, equal to 1 \"[[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|clarke]]\"). The system also features such units as ''[[Alfred E. Neuman|whatmeworry]]'', ''[[cowznofski]]'', ''vreeble'', [[wiktionary:hoo-ha|''hoo'', and ''hah'']].\n\nAccording to the \"Date\" system in Knuth's article, which substitutes a 10-clarke \"[[Norman Mingo|mingo]]\" for a month and a 100-clarke \"cowznofski\", for a year, the date of October 29, 2007 is rendered as \"Cal 7, 201 C. M.\" (for Cowznofsko Madi, or \"in the Cowznofski of our MAD\"). The dates are calculated from October 1, 1952, the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) as \"B.M.\" (\"Before MAD.\") The ten \"Mingoes\" are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)\n\n==Quantity==\n\n===Sagan===\n{{See also|Indefinite and fictitious numbers#Sagan's number}}\nAs a humorous tribute to [[Carl Sagan]] and his association with the catchphrase \"billions and billions\", a ''sagan'' has been defined as a large [[quantity]] \u2013 technically at least four billion (two billion plus two billion) \u2013 of anything.<ref>{{cite web|title=sagan|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/sagan.html|publisher=Jargon File}}</ref><ref name=\"annbot\">{{cite journal|author=P.M.

The beard-second is defined as the length an average [[beard]] grows in one [[second]].

It is named after former Buffalo mayor [[James D. Griffin]], who in 1985 earned the nickname \"Six Pack Jimmy\" after suggesting residents grab a six-pack of [[Genesee Brewing Company|Genesee beer]] to wait out an upcoming snowstorm. The index is measured in cans of beer, with roughly one can for every {{convert|4|in|cm}} of expected snowfall (the index is not perfectly linear at its lower levels as originally introduced); thus, Griffin's six-pack would be recommended for a storm bringing two feet of snow.<ref>Parker, Andy (December 5, 2017).
