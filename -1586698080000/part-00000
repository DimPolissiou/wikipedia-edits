There's a tirade against shameless conformity (\"Your New Aesthetic\"), a herky-jerky, post-punk Police homage (\"Believe in What You Want\"), and a shimmering power ballad (\"For Me This Is Heaven\"). While (\"Goodbye Sky Harbor\") spills over with layered harmonies, chiming guitar passages, and 808 spurt. Unlike the 12 other tracks on ''Clarity'', it's an almost impossible undertaking upon first listen. Once you've made it to the 13-minute mark, however, you'll never hit the skip button again.\" Cottell also stated \"I intently listened to each of the 13 tracks, fearing I would be let down by yet another alt-rock album that had little to offer besides an unrepentantly catchy single sandwiched between layers of useless chaff.

Eleanor Goodman awarded four out of five stars in her review and commented, \"though the multicoloured cover of 1999\u2019s ''Clarity'' became familiar in music shops, it's combination of melancholy, introspective pop with faster punk rock broke the band in the US\".<ref name=\"RC\"/> [[Sputnikmusic]] staff reviewer Andrew Hartwig rated the album with a \"Superb\" 4.5 out of 5 rating. He praised the musicianship of the band and stated that \"Musically, the band are excellent. The drumming is sophisticated and original and the use of two guitars is a great addition to the band. The aforementioned range of added instruments adds immensely to the arrangements of the songs\".

With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training.

Before the start of the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305 season]], rumours circulated in the Italian press that [[Inter Milan]] had approached Mancini to fill the recently vacated managerial position at the club.

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C.

Inter again won the [[2005\u201306 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2006 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]]. Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead. Inter achieved a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in [[2006\u201307 Serie A|Serie A]], starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4\u20131 home win over [[A.S.

The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]).

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]]. Towards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] at Lazio.<ref>{{cite web |title=FA Cup special: The Roberto Mancini story |last=Whalley |first=Mike |quote=He was the club captain, he often gave the team talks and he even helped to design the kit. |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1420688_fa-cup-special-the-roberto-mancini-story |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> His first manager role was at a cash-stricken [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] at only 35 years old. He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an [[Football records in Italy#Most consecutive wins|Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories]] stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/01/1860120.htm |title=Inter's winning run ends in draw with Udinese |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Football managers who never get the job \u2013 Mancini was Inter Milan's most successful manager in 30 years | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/shortlisted-football-managers-who-never-get-the-job-1821650.html?action=Popup&ino=8 | publisher=Independent Online | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 November 2009}}</ref> Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008.\n\nAfter being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009.<ref name=\"tactics\">{{cite news |title=Younger the better for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/younger-the-better-for-manchester-city-manager-roberto-mancini-1.1045178 |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u201300 season]], Lazio won the ''Scudetto'' and [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.'

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C.

Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead.

The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]).

In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the [[2010\u201311 Premier League|2010\u201311 Premier League season]].\n\nMancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players<ref>{{cite news |title=Carlos Tevez criticizes Roberto Mancini's training methods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/13/carlos-tevez-criticises-roberto-mancini |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> and especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach [[Raymond Verheijen]], who is a personal fitness coach for [[Craig Bellamy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-coach attacks Roberto Mancini's 'crazy' training at Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/23/roberto-mancini-training-methods-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and has stated, \"If a top player is not happy then it's better to go.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini tells Carlos Tevez to shape up or ship out of City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/29/roberto-mancini-carlos-tevez-city-manchester |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref>\n\nMancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players.

Emoto made use of articulate experiments and diagrams to back his theory. Many researchers like biologist Tyler Volk, physician Harriet A. Hall<ref name=\":0\" />, and biochemist William Reville have often claimed that Emoto\u2019s findings fall under the Pseudoscience dynamic, a branch of science which has not found much validation from the prudent minds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/the-pseudoscience-of-creating-beautiful-or-ugly-water-1.574583|title=The pseudoscience of creating beautiful (or ugly) water|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>.

Some people hailed the findings demonstrated in the book and spoke greatly about its relevance. \u201cThe Hidden Messages in Water is magnificent. Through his genius photography and superb scientific skill, Dr. Masaru Emoto has created a book that is truly a mystical treasure.\u201d Said Caroline M. Myss, author of Sacred Contracts and Anatomy of the Spirit. Whereas, Stephen Kiesling in Spirituality & Health Magazine wrote \"What he is saying has nothing to do with science as I know it.\" And \"Perhaps Emoto is an evangelist who values the message of his images more than the particulars of science; nevertheless, this spiritual teacher might focus his future practice less on gratitude and more on honesty\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spirituality-health.com/articles-latest-message-water-dr-emoto-spiritual-madoff/|title=Latest Message from Water: Is Dr. Emoto a Spiritual Madoff? {{!}} Spirituality & Health|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>. Noelle C. Nelson, PhD and co-author of The Power of Appreciation said that \u201cDr. Emoto's work with water beautifully illustrates the healing power of love and gratitude.\u201d On being New York Times Bestseller, literary critic Dwight Garner wrote in The New York Times Book Review that \u201cit was one of those \u201chead-scratchers\" that made him question the sanity of the reading public.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/463050722|title=Want rain?

His work has shown considerable imprints of Pseudoscience and hence the credibility of his claims are constantly under question by the scientific community. According to a report published in \u201cit is very unlikely that there is any reality behind Emoto\u2019s claims. A triple blind study of these claims failed to show any effect. Also, the phenomenon he describes has never been published in a peer reviewed science journal, which almost certainly means that the effect cannot be demonstrated under controlled conditions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/the-pseudoscience-of-creating-beautiful-or-ugly-water-1.574583|title=The pseudoscience of creating beautiful (or ugly) water|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Skeptics also believe that The Hidden Messages in Water appeals to that class of people who get fascinated by \u201cnew age science\u201d like out of body experience and Chakra healing.

Emoto made use of articulate experiments and diagrams to back his theory. Many researchers like biologist Tyler Volk, physician Harriet A. Hall<ref name=\":0\" />, and biochemist William Reville have often claimed that Emoto\u2019s findings fall under the Pseudoscience dynamic, a branch of science which has not found much validation from the prudent minds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/the-pseudoscience-of-creating-beautiful-or-ugly-water-1.574583|title=The pseudoscience of creating beautiful (or ugly) water|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>. Masaru Emoto has also been regarded as the \u2018Doctor of alternative medicine\u2019 by some sources<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n==Content==\n\nEmoto has used high speed photography and carefully propounded diagrammatic representation to elucidate the crystal formation in frozen water contingent on the nature of thoughts, the water was exposed to<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyom.com/cgi-bin/display/librarydisplay.cgi?lid=301|title=DailyOM - The Hidden Messages in Water by Masaru Emoto|website=www.dailyom.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>.

On the contrary, Emoto claims that crystal formation in water which was exposed to negative and abominable thoughts exhibited an asymmetric and unruly pattern. The book tries to suggest the idea that water might be highly reflective of its surroundings and could be used to impart health and positivity around<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.storytel.com/in/en/books/80391-The-Hidden-Messages-in-Water|title=The Hidden Messages in Water|website=www.storytel.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>.\n==Reception==\n\nThe book received a rather mixed attention. Some people hailed the findings demonstrated in the book and spoke greatly about its relevance. \u201cThe Hidden Messages in Water is magnificent. Through his genius photography and superb scientific skill, Dr. Masaru Emoto has created a book that is truly a mystical treasure.\u201d Said Caroline M. Myss, author of Sacred Contracts and Anatomy of the Spirit. Whereas, Stephen Kiesling in Spirituality & Health Magazine wrote \"What he is saying has nothing to do with science as I know it.\" And \"Perhaps Emoto is an evangelist who values the message of his images more than the particulars of science; nevertheless, this spiritual teacher might focus his future practice less on gratitude and more on honesty\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spirituality-health.com/articles-latest-message-water-dr-emoto-spiritual-madoff/|title=Latest Message from Water: Is Dr. Emoto a Spiritual Madoff? {{!}} Spirituality & Health|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>. Noelle C. Nelson, PhD and co-author of The Power of Appreciation said that \u201cDr. Emoto's work with water beautifully illustrates the healing power of love and gratitude.\u201d On being New York Times Bestseller, literary critic Dwight Garner wrote in The New York Times Book Review that \u201cit was one of those \u201chead-scratchers\" that made him question the sanity of the reading public.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/463050722|title=Want rain?

His work has shown considerable imprints of Pseudoscience and hence the credibility of his claims are constantly under question by the scientific community. According to a report published in \u201cit is very unlikely that there is any reality behind Emoto\u2019s claims. A triple blind study of these claims failed to show any effect. Also, the phenomenon he describes has never been published in a peer reviewed science journal, which almost certainly means that the effect cannot be demonstrated under controlled conditions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/the-pseudoscience-of-creating-beautiful-or-ugly-water-1.574583|title=The pseudoscience of creating beautiful (or ugly) water|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Skeptics also believe that The Hidden Messages in Water appeals to that class of people who get fascinated by \u201cnew age science\u201d like out of body experience and Chakra healing.

In his teenage years, Chinnaiya had cut the hands of Parama Thevar, for killing Chinnaiya's father, which is witnessed by Parama Thevar's daughter ([[Vaishnavi (Malayali actress)|Vaishnavi]]). This results in his daughter having a trauma of blood, and all her marriage alliances are not positive due to this.\n\nHere comes Meenakshi alias Meenu ([[Kushboo]]), who is Chinnaiya's cousin, completing her studies in the city. Both of them are in love since young, but do not tell each other. Marudhu([[Raja]]), son of Parama Thevar falls for Meenu's beauty. Marudhu takes pictures of Meenu, thinking of her. Once during a village festival, Chinnaiya fights with Marudhu which results in Meenu accusing Chinnaiya. But soon, they reconcile.\n\nMeenu's friends come from twin to bring her to a wedding. Before they leave with her, they manipulate Meenu to put up a drama with Chinnaiya for fun. Though reluctant, Meenu agrees. She falsely tells Chinnaiya that she is in love with a guy much to Chinnaiya's disappointment. At that moment, his mother, aatha ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), goes to fix alliance for Chinnaiya and Meenu.\n\nChinnaiya spots Meenu and Marudhu together, which happened to be an accidental meeting. He mistakes them to be a couple and thinks Meenu is in love with Marudhu. This worsens after he sees pictures of Meenu taken by Marudhu. Meenu, feeling guilty and unable to open up to her uncle, gives him an envelope with Chinnaiya's photo in it. She tells him that she is in love with the person in the photograph and cannot life without him. She leaves for the wedding and Chinnaiya thinks that it is picture of Marudhu.\n\nWithout his mother's knowledge and forgetting the enmity between Parama, goes to fix alliance for Meenu's sake. There, Parama asks Chinnaiya to marry his daughter, to which he agrees. Meenu comes back and gets shocked. She thereafter, tries to change Chinnaiya's mind, who on the other hand, a honest keeper.\n\nParama had actually planned to take all of Meenu's property and chase her out of the house, and kill Chinnaiya before his wedding with his daughter. Parama's mother, ([[S.N. Lakshmi]]) over hears this. He kills his mother later.\n\nParama's daughter later comes to know the truth about Meenu and Chinnaiya. She tells her father and Marudhu gets heartbroken. Parama vows revenge. When Chinnaiya's mother comes to break the alliance, Parama humiliated her by making his men walk naked around her. Angered, Chinnaiya goes to kill Parama and on the way, spots Parama's daughter married to Chinnaiya's servant ([[Charle]]). Marudhu gives up his love.\n\nOnce again humiliated, Parama decides to kill Chinnaiya and to marry Meenu. Chinnaiya rescues Meenu, and marries her in front of Parama. The villagers gather and plan to bury Parama alive, for all his misdeeds. Chinnaiya intervenes and tells the villagers that Parama's punishment is his life from that moment on. As the villagers make a move, Parama takes a sickle to kill Chinnaiya, but he is killed by Marudhu.\n\nThe film ends with Chinnaiya and Meenu, leading a happy life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Chinnaiya<ref name=ie />\n* [[Kushboo]] as Meenakshi<ref name=ie />\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Parama Thevar<ref name=ie />\n* [[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]] as Marudhu<ref name=ie />\n* [[Goundamani]] as Vellaiyangiri\n* [[Senthil]] as Vellayathevan\n* [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]\n* [[Thyagu (actor)|Thyagu]]\n* [[Charle]]\n* [[Vaishnavi (Malayali actress)|Vaishnavi]] as Mangai<ref name=ie />\n* [[S.

He mistakes them to be a couple and thinks Meenu is in love with Marudhu. This worsens after he sees pictures of Meenu taken by Marudhu. Meenu, feeling guilty and unable to open up to her uncle, gives him an envelope with Chinnaiya's photo in it. She tells him that she is in love with the person in the photograph and cannot life without him. She leaves for the wedding and Chinnaiya thinks that it is picture of Marudhu.\n\nWithout his mother's knowledge and forgetting the enmity between Parama, goes to fix alliance for Meenu's sake. There, Parama asks Chinnaiya to marry his daughter, to which he agrees. Meenu comes back and gets shocked. She thereafter, tries to change Chinnaiya's mind, who on the other hand, a honest keeper.\n\nParama had actually planned to take all of Meenu's property and chase her out of the house, and kill Chinnaiya before his wedding with his daughter. Parama's mother, ([[S.N. Lakshmi]]) over hears this. He kills his mother later.\n\nParama's daughter later comes to know the truth about Meenu and Chinnaiya. She tells her father and Marudhu gets heartbroken. Parama vows revenge. When Chinnaiya's mother comes to break the alliance, Parama humiliated her by making his men walk naked around her. Angered, Chinnaiya goes to kill Parama and on the way, spots Parama's daughter married to Chinnaiya's servant ([[Charle]]). Marudhu gives up his love.\n\nOnce again humiliated, Parama decides to kill Chinnaiya and get married to Meenu. Chinnaiya rescues Meenu, and marries her in front of Parama. The villagers gather and plan to bury Parama alive, for all his misdeeds. Chinnaiya intervenes and tells the villagers that Parama's punishment is his life from that moment on. As the villagers make a move, Parama takes a sickle to kill Chinnaiya, but he is killed by Marudhu.\n\nThe film ends with Chinnaiya and Meenu, leading a happy life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Chinnaiya<ref name=ie />\n* [[Kushboo]] as Meenakshi<ref name=ie />\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Parama Thevar<ref name=ie />\n* [[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]] as Marudhu<ref name=ie />\n* [[Goundamani]] as Vellaiyangiri\n* [[Senthil]] as Vellayathevan\n* [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]\n* [[Thyagu (actor)|Thyagu]]\n* [[Charle]]\n* [[Vaishnavi (Malayali actress)|Vaishnavi]] as Mangai<ref name=ie />\n* [[S.

He made two appearances for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Club career===\nCollen started his professional career in his hometown with Gent. He defended the white and blue colours for 2 seasons before moving to the Netherlands. He ended up with Vitesse but never broke through and he left for rivals NEC the same year. In Nijmegen he forced himself into the starting eleven and made a huge impact in his second season with NEC. Feyenoord was interested in his abilities and signed for the club in Rotterdam.\n\nOnce he arrived in Rotterdam Collen started on the bench. Due to good play in training, he forced himself into the squad and played many good matches in the Dutch top flight as well as in the UEFA Champions League. However, a string of injuries and a long period of rehabilitation caused him to be sidelined until the end of the 2002 season. He was part of the Feyenoord squad that won the [[UEFA Cup 2001-02|2001\u201302 UEFA Cup]], as an unused substitute in the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/3027393/UEFA-Cup-results-and-team-details.html|title=UEFA Cup results and team details |publisher=Telegraph |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> When he was declared suitable to play again he was loaned out to NAC Breda but suffered another a season-long injury and returned to Feyenoord.\n\nThe turning point came halfway through the 2003&ndash;04 season when he was loaned out to NAC Breda again, where he played 51 matches in one-and-a-half seasons. Feyenoord recalled him but, with [[Erwin Koeman]] as coach, he hardly played, partly due to injuries. When February arrived he started to play regularly again and was man of the match on several occasions. In the 2007&ndash;08 season he fell out of first-team contention and only appeared for the Feyenoord reserves. In the January transfer window, he returned to his homeland, signing with Sint-Truiden until 2010. However, his contract was annulled at the end of the next season.\n\nTo maintain his physical fitness he trained with NEC in the first half of the 2008\u201309 season. In the second half, he provided his services to amateur outfit SC Cambuur.

He defended the white and blue colours for 2 seasons before moving to the Netherlands. He ended up with Vitesse but never broke through and he left for rivals NEC the same year. In Nijmegen he forced himself into the starting eleven and made a huge impact in his second season with NEC. Feyenoord was interested in his abilities and signed for the club in Rotterdam.\n\nOnce he arrived in Rotterdam Collen started on the bench. Due to good play in training, he forced himself into the squad and played many good matches in the Dutch top flight as well as in the UEFA Champions League. However, a string of injuries and a long period of rehabilitation caused him to be sidelined until the end of the 2002 season. He was part of the Feyenoord squad that won the [[UEFA Cup 2001-02|2001\u201302 UEFA Cup]], as an unused substitute in the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/3027393/UEFA-Cup-results-and-team-details.html|title=UEFA Cup results and team details |publisher=Telegraph |date=8 May 2002 |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> When he was declared suitable to play again he was loaned out to NAC Breda but suffered another a season-long injury and returned to Feyenoord.\n\nThe turning point came halfway through the 2003&ndash;04 season when he was loaned out to NAC Breda again, where he played 51 matches in one-and-a-half seasons. Feyenoord recalled him but, with [[Erwin Koeman]] as coach, he hardly played, partly due to injuries. When February arrived he started to play regularly again and was man of the match on several occasions. In the 2007&ndash;08 season he fell out of first-team contention and only appeared for the Feyenoord reserves. In the January transfer window, he returned to his homeland, signing with Sint-Truiden until 2010. However, his contract was annulled at the end of the next season.\n\nTo maintain his physical fitness he trained with NEC in the first half of the 2008-09 season. In the second half, he provided his services to amateur outfit SC Cambuur. After failing to earn a longer contract with the club he continued his career in the Exqi League.\n\nOn 11 January 2010 he signed for [[Brisbane Roar]] in the Australian [[A-League]] for the remainder of the season,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbaneroar.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=31886 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306012854/http://www.brisbaneroar.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=31886 |title=Collen signs for Brisbane |author=Jones, Quinn |publisher=Brisbane Roar FC |date=11 January 2010 |archivedate=6 March 2011}}</ref> replacing former captain [[Craig Moore]].

The film stars Edward Norton and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26.

The film stars Edward Norton and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26.
