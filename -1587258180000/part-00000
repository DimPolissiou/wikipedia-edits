{"title_page": "This Man", "text_new": "{{For|the Jeremy Camp song|This Man (song)}}\n[[File:ThisMan.png|thumb|right|Drawing of \"This Man\"]]\n'''This Man''', according to a [[hoax]] website created in 2008 by Italian marketer Andrea Natella named '''Ever Dreamed this Man''', was a Gay person who was claimed to have been repeatedly seen in dreams by the whole world since 1869, but was never found in real life. Natella created the site in 2008, but it was not until October 2020 that it gained attention from the press and online internet users. This Man's notoriety spawned several internet memes that spoofed flyers of the website, references in films and television shows like ''[[The X-Files|Friends]]'' and a [[manga|The 40 Year Old virgin]] series based on the hoax by ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]''. In 2010, Natella confirmed that This Man was a hoax that was part of a [[guerilla marketing]] stunt; some sources claimed it was meant to promote a film of the same name by [[Bryan Bertino]] and [[Ghost House Pictures]] that never came into fruition.\n\n== Story of the hoax ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = left\n | image1            = Upiorwoperze ALWebber (cropped).jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | image2            = Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.jpg\n | width2            = 150\n | footer            = According to Natella,  some emails sent to ThisMan.org compared the look of This Man to real-life people such as [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ''(left)'' and [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] ''(right)''.\n}}\nAs ''Ever Dreamed This Man'', the website under the domain ThisMan.org, claims, This Man was first drawn by a \"well-known [psychiatrist]\" from New York (the site does not identify which) in January 2006, while dealing with a female patient that claimed to keep seeing This Man in her dreams.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisman.org/history/|title=History|website=Ever Dreamed This Man?|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> A few days later, one of the psychiatrist's male patients recognized the man from the drawing and said he also saw the man while sleeping.<ref name=\"History\" /> Both patients claimed they never saw him in real life.<ref name=\"History\" /> The psychiatrist then sent the picture to four other colleagues who were dealing with people having repeated dreams, and four of those colleagues' patients identified the man and described him as \"This Man.\"<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nAccording to the storyline, later on, more than 2000 people from other major cities across the world such as [[Los Angeles]], [[Berlin]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Tehran]], [[Beijing]], [[Rome]], [[Barcelona]], [[Stockholm]], [[Paris]], [[New Delhi]], and [[Moscow]] claimed to have seen the man while sleeping.<ref name=\"History\" /> Stories from those who dreamed him, who remained anonymous, suggest he was a Brazilian school teacher who had six fingers on his right hand.<ref name=\"History\" /> These dreamers' experiences of the man varied from romantic, sexual, or deadly situations to flying with the man to just seeing him staring at the dreamer and doing nothing.<ref name=\"Dreams\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisman.org/dreams/|title=Dreams|website=Ever Dreamed This Man?|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAndrea Natella, when interviewed by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine for an article that took the myth seriously (thus making Natella answer the questions as if for real), explained that he first dreamed This Man before he was aware of who he really was;
