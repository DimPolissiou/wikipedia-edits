Member institutions are located in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], and [[Missouri]].  The MSFA was organized in 1993, and on-field competition began in 1994. The MSFA is divided into two leagues, The Mideast and the Midwest. \n\nCharter members included [[Geneva College]], [[Lindenwood University]], [[Malone University|Malone College]], [[Olivet Nazarene University]], [[Saint Xavier University]], [[Taylor University]], [[Tiffin University]], [[Trinity International University]], the [[University of Findlay]], [[Urbana University]], and [[Westminster College (Pennsylvania)|Westminster College]].\n\nMSFA member schools have won eight NAIA National Championships since the inception of the league in 1993.  An MSFA team has played in each of the last seven championships, winning six of the seven, including each of the last three.  The two MSFA division champions earn an automatic bid to the NAIA National Championship Series.\n\n==National Championship appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

When stimulated by [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH), the colloid is endocytosed from the follicular lumen into the surrounding thyroid follicular epithelial cells. The colloid is subsequently cleaved by proteases to release thyroglobulin from its T3 and T4 attachments<ref>{{Citation|last=Rousset|first=Bernard|title=Chapter 2 Thyroid Hormone Synthesis And Secretion|date=2000|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285550/|work=Endotext|editor-last=Feingold|editor-first=Kenneth R.|publisher=MDText.com, Inc.|pmid=25905405|access-date=2019-09-17|last2=Dupuy|first2=Corinne|last3=Miot|first3=Fran\u00e7oise|last4=Dumont|first4=Jacques|editor2-last=Anawalt|editor2-first=Bradley|editor3-last=Boyce|editor3-first=Alison|editor4-last=Chrousos|editor4-first=George}}</ref>. \n\nThe active forms of thyroid hormone: T3 and T4, are then released into circulation where they are either unbound or attached to plasma proteins, and thyroglobulin is recycled back into the follicular lumen where it can continue to serve as a substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis<ref>{{Citation|last=Rousset|first=Bernard|title=Chapter 2 Thyroid Hormone Synthesis And Secretion|date=2000|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285550/|work=Endotext|editor-last=Feingold|editor-first=Kenneth R.|publisher=MDText.com, Inc.|pmid=25905405|access-date=2019-09-17|last2=Dupuy|first2=Corinne|last3=Miot|first3=Fran\u00e7oise|last4=Dumont|first4=Jacques|editor2-last=Anawalt|editor2-first=Bradley|editor3-last=Boyce|editor3-first=Alison|editor4-last=Chrousos|editor4-first=George}}</ref>. \n\n== Clinical significance ==\n===Half-life and clinical elevation===\nMetabolism of thyroglobulin occurs in the liver via thyroid gland recycling of the protein. Circulating thyroglobulin has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before thyroglobulin levels become undetectable. Thyroglobulin levels may be tested regularly for a few weeks or months following the removal of the thyroid.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/thyroglobulin/|title=Thyroglobulin: MedlinePlus Lab Test Information|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.{{what?|date=April 2016}}  \n\nA subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma.

Thyroglobulin is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. \n\nThyroglobulin levels are tested via a simple blood test. Tests are often ordered after thyroid cancer treatment. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===\nIn the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs), alternatively referred to as TgAb. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals. ATAs are also found in patients with [[Hashimoto's encephalopathy]], a neuroendocrine disorder related to\u2014but not caused by\u2014Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<ref name=\"pmid12601119\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferracci F, Moretto G, Candeago RM, Cimini N, Conte F, Gentile M, Papa N, Carnevale A | title = Antithyroid antibodies in the CSF: Their role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy | journal = Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 712\u20134 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12601119 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000048660.71390.c6 }}</ref>\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nThyroglobulin has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with [[Binding immunoglobulin protein]].<ref name=\"pmid11294872\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Delom F, Mallet B, Carayon P, Lejeune PJ | title = Role of extracellular molecular chaperones in the folding of oxidized proteins.

Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). \n\nATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals.

It is located across the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] from [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]], [[Croatia]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Bosnia-herzegovina Bosanska Kostajnica.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Passport stamp bearing just the name Kostajnica.]]\nIt is considered, that the name of town and municipality of Kostajnica originates from the old [[Slavic languages|slavic]] word for [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]](kostanj). This means that the name Kostajnica means the land of chestnuts. Indeed, that is true, because in the forests of the Kostajnica municipality grow this particular trees. The name of this settlement is first time recorded in the year 1258. It should be noticed, that name Kostajnica is used for the both settlements in the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] valley (Kostajnica-[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]-[[Croatia|Cro]]), which surround the Castle on the left river bank.<ref>[https://turizamrs.org/kostajnica-kroz-istoriju/ \u201eTouristic organisation of the Republic of Srpska - Kostajnica through the history\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms of the Kostajnica municipality has form of a medieval [[shield]]. In the central part of it is placed one chestnut with leaf, that represents origin of the name of this municipality and the rare plant, that grows in this area. In the lower part of coat of arms are two leaves that make together lower frame. Above these two leaves are the river [[Una (Sava)|Una]] (represented with blue colour), on the left side is the bridge, that connects two towns, and on the right side is the medieval Castle. Behind the chestnut and the leaf in the central part are two curves that define the hill of Balj, where one could find these precious fruits - chestnuts. On the top of the coat of arms is the flag of the [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srpska]]. Stone blocks represent the will to build and to be strong. On the two ends of the coat of arms are the year, when the name is first time recorded, and this recorded name. <ref>[http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/images/stories/Statut_optine_Kostajnica_5_16.pdf \u201eOfficial gazette of the Municipality of Kostajnica, number 5/16\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Name==\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], when the municipality of Kostajnica was created (former municipality has been incorporated with the [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]]), name of the town was renamed to ''Srpska Kostajnica'' (\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430).

The municipality has the area of 85,12 km2 and it is formed in the year 1995, therefore is one of the youngest municipalities in the Republic of Srpska. On the area of the whole municipality are 11 rural areas and only one urban area (settlement of Kostajnica - municipality seat). The settlements that are making the territory of this municipalities are: Gornja Slabinja, Grdanovac, Gumnjani, Zovik, Kalenderi, '''Kostajnica''', Mrakodol, Mraovo Polje, Petrinja, Pobr\u0111ani, Podo\u0161ka and Tavija. \n\n==History==\nHuman settlements in the area of \u200b\u200bKostajnica municipality are known from the period of so called \"[[Vu\u010dedol Culture]]\". According to the found remains and preserved documents, it is known that in the era of [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], there was a live trade traffic across the Una River in the territory of the present municipality of Kostajnica. Due to this location, Kostajnica was already a significant settlement with Roman water supply system. The name Kostajnica was first mentioned as a toponym in the year 1258. During the [[Middle Ages]] Kostajnica, as a significant commercial settlement and fortress, was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian Kingdom]], ie. in possession of a nobleman who recognizes the Hungarian crown. After 1513 (the victory of the Turks at [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Dubica]]), the following masters changed in constant warfare: the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], later the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]. As an integral part of the [[Illyrian Provinces|Kingdom of Illyria]], in 1809 the area of \u200b\u200bKostajnica came under the rule of [[Napoleon]], and remained until 1814. During the French rule, a wooden bridge was built between the two \"Kostajnicas\" (two towns that are situated on the both sides of the Una river banks) to facilitate the flow of goods and people. That was then the only bridge on the Una river that served to transport goods from the Middle East to Europe and vice versa. After a brief French administration, Kostajnica again came under Turkish rule in 1814. During the periods of Turkish rule, the population of this region raised numerous uprisings. The most famous is Pecia's uprising in 1858, that was led by the [[hajduk|hajduks]] Petar Petrovic Pecija and Petar Garaca. In 1878 Kostajnica again came under Austrian rule and remained until the end of [[World War I]]. During the Austro-Hungarian period Kostajnica was first a district, and later a branch of the Bosnian-Novi district. During the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] Kostajnica was a trade and craft center. During [[World War II]], the population of this region participated massively in the fight against fascism. This is evidenced by the legendary Balj Company (named after the hill above Kostajnica), which was made up of fighters mostly recruited from the area. In addition to the fallen fighters, as many as 1,848, inhabitants of the municipality lost their lives as victims of the fascist terror war. Their execution sites are [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], Zemun, Baji\u0107a jame and Ze\u010devo Brdo. After World War II, Kostajnica, under the name Bosanska Kostajnica, existed as a municipality within the Bosanski-Novi and later Prijedor district.<ref>-{\u040b\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0416.}-: ''-{\u041e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}-''; -{''\u0106ur\u010dija, \u017d.''}-: ''-{Srpska Kostajnica Municipality}-'' Kostajnica, march 1995. </ref>\n\n==Geographical position==\nThe Kostajnica municipality is situated in north-west part of [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srspka]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and lies at one of the ends of Republika Srpska territory (Other is [[Trebinje]] at the south-east).

For this town the border checkpoint between BiH and Croatia has a large importance for the local economy and it is located at the very centre of the city.

This means that the name Kostajnica means the land of chestnuts. Indeed, that is true, because in the forests of the Kostajnica municipality grow this particular trees. The name of this settlement is first time recorded in the year 1258. It should be noticed, that name Kostajnica is used for the both settlements in the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] valley (Kostajnica-[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]-[[Croatia|Cro]]), which surround the Castle on the left river bank.<ref>[https://turizamrs.org/kostajnica-kroz-istoriju/ \u201eTouristic organisation of the Republic of Srpska - Kostajnica through the history\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms of the Kostajnica municipality has form of a medieval [[shield]]. In the central part of it is placed one chestnut with leaf, that represents origin of the name of this municipality and the rare plant, that grows in this area. In the lower part of coat of arms are two leaves that make together lower frame. Above these two leaves are the river [[Una (Sava)|Una]] (represented with blue colour), on the left side is the bridge, that connects two towns, and on the right side is the medieval Castle. Behind the chestnut and the leaf in the central part are two curves that define the hill of Balj, where one could find these precious fruits - chestnuts. On the top of the coat of arms is the flag of the [[Republika Srpska|Republic of Srpska]]. Stone blocks represent the will to build and to be strong. On the two ends of the coat of arms are the year, when the name is first time recorded, and this recorded name. <ref>[http://www.opstina-kostajnica.com/images/stories/Statut_optine_Kostajnica_5_16.pdf \u201eOfficial gazette of the Municipality of Kostajnica, number 5/16\u201d] </ref>\n\n==Name==\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], when the municipality of Kostajnica was created (former municipality has been incorporated with the [[Novi Grad, Republika Srpska|Novi Grad municipality]]), name of the town was renamed to ''Srpska Kostajnica'' (\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0458\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430).

A study of the arthrodire ''[[Compagopiscis]]'' published in 2012 concluded that placoderms (at least this particular genus) likely possessed true teeth contrary to some early studies. The teeth had well defined [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavities]] and were made of both bone and [[dentine]]. However, the tooth and jaw development were not as closely integrated as in modern gnathostomes.

With this discovery, the placoderm became the oldest vertebrate known to have given birth to live young (\"[[Viviparity|viviparous]]\"),<ref name=\"BBC\"/> pushing the date of first viviparity back some 200 million years earlier than had been previously known. Specimens of the arthrodire ''[[Incisoscutum]] ritchei'', also from the Gogo Formation, have been found with embryos inside them indicating this group also had live bearing ability.<ref>Long et al. 2009</ref> The males reproduced by inserting a long [[clasper]] into the female. Elongated basipterygia are also found on the phyllolepid placoderms, such as ''[[Austrophyllolepis]]''<ref>Long 1984</ref> and ''[[Cowralepis]]'', both from the Middle Devonian of Australia, suggesting that the basiptergia were used in copulation.\n\nThe placoderm claspers are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the claspers in [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fishes]]. The similarities between the structures has been revealed to be an example of [[convergent evolution]]. While the claspers in cartilaginous fishes are specialized parts of their paired pelvic fins that have been modified for copulation due to changes in the hox genes hoxd13, the origin of the mating organs in placoderms most likely relied on different sets of hox genes and were structures that developed further down the body as an extra and independent pair of appendages, but which during development turned into body parts used for reproduction only. Because they were not attached to the pelvic fins, as are the claspers in fish like sharks, they were much more flexible and could probably be rotated forward.<ref>[https://theconversation.com/the-first-vertebrate-sexual-organs-evolved-as-an-extra-pair-of-legs-27578 The first vertebrate sexual organs evolved as an extra pair of legs]</ref>\n\n==Evolution and extinction==\n[[File:Evolution of placoderms.png|thumb|260px|right|Evolution and extinction of [[placoderms]].

With more accurate summaries of prehistoric organisms, it is now thought that they systematically died out as marine and freshwater ecologies suffered from the environmental catastrophes of the [[End-Devonian extinction|Devonian/Carboniferous extinction events]].\n\n===Fossil record===\nThe earliest identifiable placoderm fossils are from China and date to the early [[Silurian]]. At that time, they were already differentiated into [[Antiarchi|antiarchs]] and [[Arthrodira|arthrodires]], as well as other, more primitive, groups. Earlier fossils of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Placodermi have not yet been discovered.\n\nThe Silurian fossil record of the placoderms is both literally and figuratively fragmented. Until the discovery of ''[[Silurolepis]]'' (and then, the discoveries of ''[[Entelognathus]]'' and ''[[Qilinyu]]''), Silurian-aged placoderm specimens consisted of fragments. Some of them have been tentatively identified as antiarch or arthrodire due to histological similarities; and many of them have not yet been formally described or even named. The most commonly cited example of a Silurian placoderm, ''[[Wangolepis]]'' of Silurian China and possibly Vietnam, is known only from a few fragments that currently defy attempts to place them in any of the recognized placoderm orders. So far, only three officially described Silurian placoderms are known from more than scraps:\n* the basal antiarch ''[[Silurolepis]]'', from the [[Ludlow epoch]] of [[Yunnan]], China, known from an almost complete thoracic armor\n* ''[[Entelognathus]]'', a placoderm ''[[incertae sedis]]'' that combines features of primitive arthrodires with jaw anatomy otherwise only seen in [[bony fish]] and [[tetrapod]]s.\n* ''[[Qilinyu]]'', a close relative of ''Entelognathus'' that further links ''Entelognathus'' as a transitional form between placoderms and other stem-gnathostomes and crown-group gnathostomes.\n\nThe first officially described and oldest Silurian placoderm is an antiarch, ''[[Shimenolepis]]'', which is known from distinctively ornamented plates from the late Llandovery of [[Hunan]], China. ''Shimenolepis'' plates are very similar to the early Devonian [[Yunnanolepiformes|yunnanolepid]] ''[[Zhanjilepis]]'', also known from distinctively ornamented plates.<ref name=\"BurrowTurner\" /><ref name=\"WangJ\">{{cite journal | url=http://article.geobiology.cn/lunwen/%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%B3%BB/014/%E6%B9%98%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%BA%AA%E8%83%B4%E7%94%B2%E9%B1%BC%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3.pdf | title=The Antiarchi from Early Silurian Hunan | author=Wang Junqing | journal=Vertebrata PalAsiatica | year=1991 | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=240\u2013244 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212161921/http://article.geobiology.cn/lunwen/%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%B3%BB/014/%E6%B9%98%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%BA%AA%E8%83%B4%E7%94%B2%E9%B1%BC%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3.pdf | archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nPaleontologists and placoderm specialists suspect that the scarcity of placoderms in the Silurian fossil record is due to placoderms' living in environments unconducive to fossil preservation, rather than a genuine scarcity. This hypothesis helps to explain the placoderms' seemingly instantaneous appearance and diversity at the very beginning of the Devonian.\n\nDuring the Devonian, placoderms went on to inhabit and dominate almost all known aquatic ecosystems, both [[freshwater]] and [[seawater|saltwater]].<ref name=PlacodermUCMP>{{cite web|last=Waggoner|first=Ben|title=Introduction to the Placodermi|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfish/placodermi.html|publisher=UCMP|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> But this diversity ultimately suffered many casualties during the extinction event at the [[Frasnian]]\u2013[[Famennian]] boundary, the [[Late Devonian extinction]]s. The remaining species then died out during the Devonian/[[Carboniferous]] extinction event; not a single placoderm species has been confirmed to have survived into the Carboniferous.\n\n===History of study===\nThe earliest studies of placoderms were published by [[Louis Agassiz]], in his five volumes on fossil fishes, 1833\u20131843. In those days, placoderms were thought to be shelled jawless fish akin to [[ostracoderms]]. Some naturalists even suggested that they were shelled invertebrates or even [[turtle]]-like vertebrates.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Dr. [[Erik Stensi\u00f6]], at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] in [[Stockholm]], established the details of placoderm anatomy and identified them as true jawed fishes related to [[shark]]s. He took fossil specimens with well-preserved skulls and ground them away, one tenth of a millimeter at a time. Between each grinding, he made an imprint in [[wax]]. Once the specimens had been completely ground away (and so destroyed), he made enlarged, three-dimensional models of the skulls to examine the anatomical details more thoroughly. Many other placoderm specialists thought that Stensi\u00f6 was trying to shoehorn placoderms into a relationship with [[shark]]s; however, as more fossils were found, placoderms were accepted as a sister group of [[Chondrichthyes|chondrichthyian]]s.\n\nMuch later, the exquisitely preserved placoderm fossils from Gogo reef changed the picture again. They showed that placoderms shared anatomical features not only with chondrichthyians but with other [[gnathostome]] groups as well. For example, Gogo placoderms show separate bones for the nasal capsules as in gnathostomes; in both sharks and bony fish those bones are incorporated into the braincase.<ref>Young, G.C. & Goujet, D. & Lelievre, H. (2001) Extraocular muscles and cranial segmentation in primitive gnathostomes \u2013 fossil evidence. Journal of Morphology. 248:304.</ref><ref>Goujet, Daniel & Young, Gavin (2004). Placoderm anatomy and phylogeny: new insights. (in) Arratia, Wilson and Cloutier (eds) Recent Advances in the Origin and Early Radiation of Vertebrates. Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil, Munchen, Germany.</ref>\n\nPlacoderms also share certain anatomical features only with the jawless [[osteostracan]]s; because of this, the theory that placoderms are the sister group of chondrichthyians has been replaced by the theory that placoderms are a group of stem gnathostomes.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nCurrently, Placodermi are divided into eight recognized [[Order (biology)|orders]]. There are two further controversial orders: One is the [[monotypic]] Stensioellida, containing the enigmatic ''[[Stensioella]]''; the other is the equally enigmatic [[Pseudopetalichthyida]]. These orders are considered to be basal or primitive groups within Placodermi, though their precise placement within the class remains unsure. Fossils of both are currently known only from the [[Hunsruck]] [[lagerstatten]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Placoderm orders\n|-\n! [[Arthrodira]]\n| [[File:Dunkleosteus intermedius.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Dunkleosteus]]''</center>\n| [[File:Coccosteus BW.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''[[Coccosteus]]'']]\n[[File:Titanichthys10.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''[[Titanichthys]]'']]\n[[Arthrodira]] (\"jointed neck\") were the most diverse and numerically successful of the placoderm orders, occupying roles from giant [[apex predator]]s to [[detritus]]-nibbling [[bottom dweller]]s. They had a movable joint between armour surrounding the head and body. As the lower jaw moved down, the head shield moved, allowing for a larger opening. All arthrodires, save for ''Compagopiscis'', lacked teeth, and used instead the sharpened edges of a bony plate, termed a \"tooth plate,\" as a biting surface (''Compagopiscis'' had true teeth in addition to tooth plates). The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some [[ichthyosaurs]]. Early arthrodires, such as the genus ''[[Arctolepis]]'', were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', was a true \"superpredator\" of the latest Devonian period, reaching 3 to as much as 9 metres in length. In contrast, the long-nosed ''[[Rolfosteus]]'' measured just 15&nbsp;cm. Fossils of ''[[Incisoscutum]]'' have been found containing unborn fetuses, indicating that arthrodires gave birth to live young.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080606104814.htm |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |title=Fish 380 Million Years Old Found With Unborn Embryo |date=June 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\n|-\n! [[Antiarchi]]\n| [[File:Bothriolepis canadensis.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Bothriolepis canadensis]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Antiarchi]] (\"opposite anus\") were the second most successful order of placoderms known, after the [[Arthrodira]]. The order's name was coined by [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who, after incorrectly identifying the first fossils as being those of an armored [[tunicate]], mistakenly thought the [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye-hole]] was the mouth, and the opening for the anal siphon was on the other side of the body, as opposed to having both oral and anal siphons together at one end. The front portions of their bodies were heavily armoured, to the point of literally resembling a box with eyes, with the sometimes scaled, sometimes naked rear portions often becoming [[wiktionary:sinuous|sinuous]], particularly with later forms. The pair of [[pectoral fins]] were modified into a pair of [[caliper]]-like, or [[arthropod]]-like limbs. In primitive forms, such as ''[[Yunnanolepis]]'', the limbs were thick and short, while in advanced forms, such as ''[[Bothriolepis]]'', the limbs were long and had elbow-like joints. The function of the limbs is still not perfectly understood, but most hypothesize that they helped their owners pull themselves across the substrate, as well as allowing their owners to bury themselves into the substrate.{{ctn|date=August 2013}}\n|-\n! [[Brindabellaspida]]\n| [[File:Brindabellaspis stensioi.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Brindabellaspis stensioi]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Brindabellaspida]] (\"[[Brindabella Ranges|Brindabella's]] shield\") was a long-snouted placoderm from the [[Early Devonian]]. When it was first discovered in 1980, it was originally regarded as a [[weejasperaspid]] [[acanthothoracid]] due to anatomical similarities with the other species found at the same locality. According to [[Philippe Janvier]], anatomical similarities in the brain of ''[[Brindabellaspis stensioi]]'' and the brain of a [[jawless fish]] suggest it is a basal placoderm closest to the ancestral placoderm. Various Early to Middle Devonian placoderm ''[[incertae sedis]]'' have also been inserted in the order.\n|-\n! [[Phyllolepida]]\n| [[File:Phyllolepis12DB.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Phyllolepis|Phyllolepis orvini]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Phyllolepida]] (\"leaf scales\") were flattened placoderms found throughout the world. Like other flattened placoderms they were bottom-dwelling predators that ambushed prey. Unlike other flattened placoderms, they were freshwater fish. Their armour was made of whole plates, rather than the numerous tubercles and scales of Petalichthyida. The eyes were on the sides of the head, unlike visual bottom-dwelling predators, such as [[Stargazer (fish)|stargazer]]s or [[flatfish]], which have eyes on the top of their head. The orbits for the eyes were extremely small, suggesting the eyes were vestigial and that the phyllolepids may have been blind.\n|-\n! [[Ptyctodontida]]\n| [[File:Rhamphodopsis threiplandi.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Rhamphodopsis|Rhamphodopsis threiplandi]]''</center>\n| [[Ptyctodontida]] (\"folded teeth\") were lightly armoured placoderms with big heads, big eyes and long bodies. They have a strong but superficial resemblance to modern day [[chimaera]]s. Their armour was reduced to a pattern of small plates around the head and neck. Like the extinct and related [[acanthothoracids]], and the living and unrelated holocephalians, most of the ptyctodontids are thought to have lived near the sea bottom and preyed on [[shellfish]]. On account of their lack of armour, some paleontologists have suggested that the Ptyctodontida were not placoderms, but [[holocephalians]] or the ancestors of holocephalians. Anatomical examinations of whole fossil specimens have shown that the similarities between these two groups are superficial. The major differences were that holocephalians have [[shagreen]] on their skin, while ptyctodontids do not; the armoured plates and scales of holocephalians are made of [[dentine]], while those of ptyctodontids are made of bone; the craniums of holocephalians are similar to sharks, while those of ptyctodontids are similar to those of other placoderms; and, most importantly, that holocephalians have true teeth, while ptyctodonts have beak-like tooth plates. Ptyctodontids were [[sexually dimorphic]], with the males having pelvic [[clasper]]s and possibly claspers on the head as well.\n|-\n! [[Rhenanida]]\n| [[File:Asterosteus stenocephalus.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Asterosteus]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Rhenanida]] (\"[[Rhine]] fish\") were flattened, [[Batoidea|ray-like]], bottom-dwelling [[predator]]s with large, upturned mouths that lived in marine environments. The rhenanids were once presumed to be the most primitive, or at least the closest to the ancestral placoderm, as their armour was made of unfused components\u2014a mosaic of tubercles\u2014as opposed to the solidified plates of \"advanced\" placoderms, such as [[antiarch]]s and [[arthrodire]]s. However, through comparisons of skull anatomies, rhenanids are now considered to be the sister group of the antiarchs. When rhenanids die, their \"mosaics\" come apart, and it has been suggested that the rarity of rhenanids in the fossil record reflects postmortem disassociation, and is not an actual rarity of the species.\n|-\n! [[Acanthothoraci]]\n| [[File:Palaeacanthaspis vasta.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Palaeacanthaspis]]''</center>\n| [[Acanthothoraci]] (\"spine chests\") were a group of [[Chimaera|chimaera-like]] placoderms closely related to the rhenanid placoderms. Superficially, acanthoracids resembled scaly [[chimaera]]s or small, scaly arthrodires with blunt [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrums]]. They were distinguished from chimaeras by a pair of large spines that emanate from their chests, the presence of large scales and plates, tooth-like beak plates, and the typical bone-enhanced placoderm eyeball. They were distinguished from other placoderms due to differences in the anatomy of their skulls, and due to patterns on the skull plates and thoracic plates that are unique to this order. From what can be inferred from the mouthplates of fossil specimens, acanthothoracids were shellfish hunters ecologically similar to modern-day chimaeras. Competition with their relatives, the ptyctodont placoderms, may have been one of the main reasons for the acanthothoracids' extinction prior to the mid-Devonian extinction event.\n|-\n! [[Petalichthyida]]\n| [[File:Lunaspis.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Lunaspis]]''</center>\n| [[Petalichthyida]] (\"thin-plated fish\") were small, flattened placoderms, typified by their splayed fins and numerous tubercles that decorated all of the plates and scales of their armour. They reached a peak in diversity during the [[Early Devonian]] and were found throughout the world. The petalichthids ''[[Lunaspis]]'' and ''Wijdeaspis'' are among the best known. There was an independent diversification event that occurred in what is now Southern China, producing a handful of unique genera that were once placed in their own order, \"Quasipetalichthyida\", named after the first discovered species there, ''[[Quasipetalichthys haikouensis]]''. Soon after the petalichthids' diversification, they went into decline. Because they had compressed body forms, it is supposed they were bottom-dwellers that pursued or ambushed smaller fish. Their diet is not clear, as none of the fossil specimens found have preserved mouth parts.\n|-\n! [[Pseudopetalichthyida|Pseudo-<br />petalichthyida]]<br />?\n| [[File:Pseudopetalichthys problematica.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Pseudopetalicthys problematica]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Pseudopetalichthyida]] (\"false petalichthyids\") is a group of elongated, possibly flattened fishes comprising three, poorly preserved and poorly studied genera. It is known only from rare fossils in Lower Devonian strata in [[Hunsr\u00fcck]], Germany. Like ''[[Stensioella heintzi]]'', and the [[Rhenanida]], the pseudopetalichthids had armour made up of a mosaic of tubercles. Like ''[[Stensioella heintzi]]'', the pseudopetalichthids' placement within Placodermi is suspect. The matter is not easy to resolve because there are no complete, undamaged and articulated specimens. The anatomical studies done on the crushed specimens that have been found indicate that if they are placoderms, they may be a group more advanced than the [[ptyctodont]]s. As such, placoderm experts consider [[Pseudopetalichthyida]] to be the sister group of the [[Arthrodires]] + [[Phyllolepida]] + [[Antiarchi]] [[Speciation#Genetics|trichotomy]] and the [[Acanthothoraci]] + [[Rhenanida]] [[dichotomy]].\n|-\n! [[Stensioellida]]<br />?\n| [[File:Stensioella heintzi.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Stensioella heintzi]]''</center>\n| [[Stensioellida]] (\"[Heintz's] little [[Erik Stensio|Stensio]]\") contains another problematic placoderm of uncertain affinity, known only from the [[Lower Devonian]] [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] slates of Germany. ''Stensioella'' was a thin fish that, when alive, looked vaguely like an elongated [[chimaeridae|ratfish]], or a skinny ''[[Gemuendina]]'' with thin, strap-like pectoral fins. Similar to those of the Rhenanida, its armour was a complex mosaic of small, scale-like tubercles. The shoulder joints of its armour are similar to other placoderms, and there are superficial similarities in skull plates, and even more superficial similarities between its tubercles and the tubercles of the [[rhenanids]]. It is tentatively placed within Placodermi as a primitive placoderm, though some paleontologists believe the rationale for the placement is inadequate.

Many, primarily the [[Arthrodira]], were active, [[nekton]]ic predators that dwelled in the middle to upper portions of the water column. A study of the arthrodire ''[[Compagopiscis]]'' published in 2012 concluded that placoderms (at least this particular genus) likely possessed true teeth contrary to some early studies. The teeth had well defined [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavities]] and were made of both bone and [[dentine]]. However, the tooth and jaw development were not as closely integrated as in modern gnathostomes. These teeth were likely homologous to the teeth of other gnathostomes.<ref name=\"Rucklin2012\" />\n\n[[File:Placoderm anatomy.png|thumb|left|400px|{{center|External anatomy of the placoderm ''[[Coccosteus|Coccosteus decipiens]]''}}]]\n\n{{clear left}}\n\nOne of the largest known arthrodires, ''[[Dunkleosteus]] terrelli '', was {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} long,<ref name=Anderson&Westneat2009>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.S.L.|author2=Westneat, M.|title=A biomechanical model of feeding kinematics for Dunkleosteus terrelli (Arthrodira, Placodermi)|journal=Paleobiology|date=2009|volume=35|issue=2|pages=251\u2013269|doi=10.1666/08011.1}}</ref><ref name=\"Carr2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Robert K.|title=Paleoecology of Dunkleosteus terrelli (Placodermi: Arthrodira).|journal=Kirtlandia|date=2010|volume=57|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235924093}}</ref> and is presumed to have had a large distribution, as its remains have been found in Europe, North America and possibly Morocco. Some paleontologists regard it as the world's first [[vertebrate]] \"superpredator\", preying upon other predators. Other, smaller arthrodires, such as ''[[Fallacosteus]]'' and ''[[Rolfosteus]]'', both of the [[Gogo Formation]] of Western Australia, had streamlined, bullet-shaped head armor, strongly supporting the idea that many, if not most, arthrodires were active swimmers, rather than passive [[Ambush predator|ambush-hunters]] whose armor practically anchored them to the sea floor. Some placoderms were herbivorous, such as the Middle to Late Devonian arthrodire ''[[Holonema]]'', and some were planktivores, such as the gigantic, {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} long arthrodire, ''[[Titanichthys]]''.\n\nExtraordinary evidence of internal fertilization in a placoderm was afforded by the discovery in the Gogo Formation, near [[Fitzroy Crossing]], [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]], Western Australia,<ref>Long & Trinajstic 2010</ref> of a small female placoderm, about {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} in length, which died in the process of giving birth to a 6&nbsp;cm ({{frac|2|1|2}}&nbsp;in) offspring and was fossilized with the umbilical cord intact.<ref>Long et al. 2008</ref> The fossil, named ''[[Materpiscis attenboroughi]]'' (after scientist [[David Attenborough]]), had eggs which were fertilized internally, the mother providing nourishment to the embryo and giving birth to live young. With this discovery, the placoderm became the oldest vertebrate known to have given birth to live young (\"[[Viviparity|viviparous]]\"),<ref name=\"BBC\"/> pushing the date of first viviparity back some 200 million years earlier than had been previously known. Specimens of the arthrodire ''[[Incisoscutum]] ritchei'', also from the Gogo Formation, have been found with embryos inside them indicating this group also had live bearing ability.<ref>Long et al. 2009</ref> The males reproduced by inserting a long [[clasper]] into the female. Elongated basipterygia are also found on the phyllolepid placoderms, such as ''[[Austrophyllolepis]]''<ref>Long 1984</ref> and ''[[Cowralepis]]'', both from the Middle Devonian of Australia, suggesting that the basiptergia were used in copulation.\n\nThe placoderm claspers are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the claspers in [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fishes]]. The similarities between the structures has been revealed to be an example of [[convergent evolution]]. While the claspers in cartilaginous fishes are specialized parts of their paired pelvic fins that have been modified for copulation due to changes in the hox genes hoxd13, the origin of the mating organs in placoderms most likely relied on different sets of hox genes and were structures that developed further down the body as an extra and independent pair of appendages, but which during development turned into body parts used for reproduction only. Because they were not attached to the pelvic fins, as are the claspers in fish like sharks, they were much more flexible and could probably be rotated forward.<ref>[https://theconversation.com/the-first-vertebrate-sexual-organs-evolved-as-an-extra-pair-of-legs-27578 The first vertebrate sexual organs evolved as an extra pair of legs]</ref>\n\n==Evolution and extinction==\n[[File:Evolution of placoderms.png|thumb|260px|right|Evolution and extinction of [[placoderms]].

With more accurate summaries of prehistoric organisms, it is now thought that they systematically died out as marine and freshwater ecologies suffered from the environmental catastrophes of the [[End-Devonian extinction|Devonian/Carboniferous extinction events]].\n\n===Fossil record===\nThe earliest identifiable placoderm fossils are from China and date to the early [[Silurian]]. At that time, they were already differentiated into [[Antiarchi|antiarchs]] and [[Arthrodira|arthrodires]], as well as other, more primitive, groups. Earlier fossils of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Placodermi have not yet been discovered.\n\nThe Silurian fossil record of the placoderms is both literally and figuratively fragmented. Until the discovery of ''[[Silurolepis]]'' (and then, the discoveries of ''[[Entelognathus]]'' and ''[[Qilinyu]]''), Silurian-aged placoderm specimens consisted of fragments. Some of them have been tentatively identified as antiarch or arthrodire due to histological similarities; and many of them have not yet been formally described or even named. The most commonly cited example of a Silurian placoderm, ''[[Wangolepis]]'' of Silurian China and possibly Vietnam, is known only from a few fragments that currently defy attempts to place them in any of the recognized placoderm orders. So far, only three officially described Silurian placoderms are known from more than scraps:\n* the basal antiarch ''[[Silurolepis]]'', from the [[Ludlow epoch]] of [[Yunnan]], China, known from an almost complete thoracic armor\n* ''[[Entelognathus]]'', a placoderm ''[[incertae sedis]]'' that combines features of primitive arthrodires with jaw anatomy otherwise only seen in [[bony fish]] and [[tetrapod]]s.\n* ''[[Qilinyu]]'', a close relative of ''Entelognathus'' that further links ''Entelognathus'' as a transitional form between placoderms and other stem-gnathostomes and crown-group gnathostomes.\n\nThe first officially described and oldest Silurian placoderm is an antiarch, ''[[Shimenolepis]]'', which is known from distinctively ornamented plates from the late Llandovery of [[Hunan]], China. ''Shimenolepis'' plates are very similar to the early Devonian [[Yunnanolepiformes|yunnanolepid]] ''[[Zhanjilepis]]'', also known from distinctively ornamented plates.<ref name=\"BurrowTurner\" /><ref name=\"WangJ\">{{cite journal | url=http://article.geobiology.cn/lunwen/%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%B3%BB/014/%E6%B9%98%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%BA%AA%E8%83%B4%E7%94%B2%E9%B1%BC%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3.pdf | title=The Antiarchi from Early Silurian Hunan | author=Wang Junqing | journal=Vertebrata PalAsiatica | year=1991 | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=240\u2013244 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212161921/http://article.geobiology.cn/lunwen/%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%B3%BB/014/%E6%B9%98%E8%A5%BF%E5%8C%97%E5%BF%97%E7%95%99%E7%BA%AA%E8%83%B4%E7%94%B2%E9%B1%BC%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3.pdf | archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nPaleontologists and placoderm specialists suspect that the scarcity of placoderms in the Silurian fossil record is due to placoderms' living in environments unconducive to fossil preservation, rather than a genuine scarcity. This hypothesis helps to explain the placoderms' seemingly instantaneous appearance and diversity at the very beginning of the Devonian.\n\nDuring the Devonian, placoderms went on to inhabit and dominate almost all known aquatic ecosystems, both [[freshwater]] and [[seawater|saltwater]].<ref name=PlacodermUCMP>{{cite web|last=Waggoner|first=Ben|title=Introduction to the Placodermi|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/basalfish/placodermi.html|publisher=UCMP|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> But this diversity ultimately suffered many casualties during the extinction event at the [[Frasnian]]\u2013[[Famennian]] boundary, the [[Late Devonian extinction]]s. The remaining species then died out during the Devonian/[[Carboniferous]] extinction event; not a single placoderm species has been confirmed to have survived into the Carboniferous.\n\n===History of study===\nThe earliest studies of placoderms were published by [[Louis Agassiz]], in his five volumes on fossil fishes, 1833\u20131843. In those days, placoderms were thought to be shelled jawless fish akin to [[ostracoderms]]. Some naturalists even suggested that they were shelled invertebrates or even [[turtle]]-like vertebrates.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Dr. [[Erik Stensi\u00f6]], at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] in [[Stockholm]], established the details of placoderm anatomy and identified them as true jawed fishes related to [[shark]]s. He took fossil specimens with well-preserved skulls and ground them away, one tenth of a millimeter at a time. Between each grinding, he made an imprint in [[wax]]. Once the specimens had been completely ground away (and so destroyed), he made enlarged, three-dimensional models of the skulls to examine the anatomical details more thoroughly. Many other placoderm specialists thought that Stensi\u00f6 was trying to shoehorn placoderms into a relationship with [[shark]]s; however, as more fossils were found, placoderms were accepted as a sister group of [[Chondrichthyes|chondrichthyian]]s.\n\nMuch later, the exquisitely preserved placoderm fossils from Gogo reef changed the picture again. They showed that placoderms shared anatomical features not only with chondrichthyians but with other [[gnathostome]] groups as well. For example, Gogo placoderms show separate bones for the nasal capsules as in gnathostomes; in both sharks and bony fish those bones are incorporated into the braincase.<ref>Young, G.C. & Goujet, D. & Lelievre, H. (2001) Extraocular muscles and cranial segmentation in primitive gnathostomes \u2013 fossil evidence. Journal of Morphology. 248:304.</ref><ref>Goujet, Daniel & Young, Gavin (2004). Placoderm anatomy and phylogeny: new insights. (in) Arratia, Wilson and Cloutier (eds) Recent Advances in the Origin and Early Radiation of Vertebrates. Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil, Munchen, Germany.</ref>\n\nPlacoderms also share certain anatomical features only with the jawless [[osteostracan]]s; because of this, the theory that placoderms are the sister group of chondrichthyians has been replaced by the theory that placoderms are a group of stem gnathostomes.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nCurrently, Placodermi are divided into eight recognized [[Order (biology)|orders]]. There are two further controversial orders: One is the [[monotypic]] Stensioellida, containing the enigmatic ''[[Stensioella]]''; the other is the equally enigmatic [[Pseudopetalichthyida]]. These orders are considered to be basal or primitive groups within Placodermi, though their precise placement within the class remains unsure. Fossils of both are currently known only from the [[Hunsruck]] [[lagerstatten]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Placoderm orders\n|-\n! [[Arthrodira]]\n| [[File:Dunkleosteus intermedius.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Dunkleosteus]]''</center>\n| [[File:Coccosteus BW.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''[[Coccosteus]]'']]\n[[File:Titanichthys10.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''[[Titanichthys]]'']]\n[[Arthrodira]] (\"jointed neck\") were the most diverse and numerically successful of the placoderm orders, occupying roles from giant [[apex predator]]s to [[detritus]]-nibbling [[bottom dweller]]s. They had a movable joint between armour surrounding the head and body. As the lower jaw moved down, the head shield moved, allowing for a larger opening. All arthrodires, save for ''Compagopiscis'', lacked teeth, and used instead the sharpened edges of a bony plate, termed a \"tooth plate,\" as a biting surface (''Compagopiscis'' had true teeth in addition to tooth plates). The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some [[ichthyosaurs]]. Early arthrodires, such as the genus ''[[Arctolepis]]'', were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', was a true \"superpredator\" of the latest Devonian period, reaching 3 to as much as 9 metres in length. In contrast, the long-nosed ''[[Rolfosteus]]'' measured just 15&nbsp;cm. Fossils of ''[[Incisoscutum]]'' have been found containing unborn fetuses, indicating that arthrodires gave birth to live young.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080606104814.htm |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |title=Fish 380 Million Years Old Found With Unborn Embryo |date=June 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\n|-\n! [[Antiarchi]]\n| [[File:Bothriolepis canadensis.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Bothriolepis canadensis]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Antiarchi]] (\"opposite anus\") were the second most successful order of placoderms known, after the [[Arthrodira]]. The order's name was coined by [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who, after incorrectly identifying the first fossils as being those of an armored [[tunicate]], mistakenly thought the [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye-hole]] was the mouth, and the opening for the anal siphon was on the other side of the body, as opposed to having both oral and anal siphons together at one end. The front portions of their bodies were heavily armoured, to the point of literally resembling a box with eyes, with the sometimes scaled, sometimes naked rear portions often becoming [[wiktionary:sinuous|sinuous]], particularly with later forms. The pair of [[pectoral fins]] were modified into a pair of [[caliper]]-like, or [[arthropod]]-like limbs. In primitive forms, such as ''[[Yunnanolepis]]'', the limbs were thick and short, while in advanced forms, such as ''[[Bothriolepis]]'', the limbs were long and had elbow-like joints. The function of the limbs is still not perfectly understood, but most hypothesize that they helped their owners pull themselves across the substrate, as well as allowing their owners to bury themselves into the substrate.{{ctn|date=August 2013}}\n|-\n! [[Brindabellaspida]]\n| [[File:Brindabellaspis stensioi.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Brindabellaspis stensioi]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Brindabellaspida]] (\"[[Brindabella Ranges|Brindabella's]] shield\") was a long-snouted placoderm from the [[Early Devonian]]. When it was first discovered in 1980, it was originally regarded as a [[weejasperaspid]] [[acanthothoracid]] due to anatomical similarities with the other species found at the same locality. According to [[Philippe Janvier]], anatomical similarities in the brain of ''[[Brindabellaspis stensioi]]'' and the brain of a [[jawless fish]] suggest it is a basal placoderm closest to the ancestral placoderm. Various Early to Middle Devonian placoderm ''[[incertae sedis]]'' have also been inserted in the order.\n|-\n! [[Phyllolepida]]\n| [[File:Phyllolepis12DB.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Phyllolepis|Phyllolepis orvini]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Phyllolepida]] (\"leaf scales\") were flattened placoderms found throughout the world. Like other flattened placoderms they were bottom-dwelling predators that ambushed prey. Unlike other flattened placoderms, they were freshwater fish. Their armour was made of whole plates, rather than the numerous tubercles and scales of Petalichthyida. The eyes were on the sides of the head, unlike visual bottom-dwelling predators, such as [[Stargazer (fish)|stargazer]]s or [[flatfish]], which have eyes on the top of their head. The orbits for the eyes were extremely small, suggesting the eyes were vestigial and that the phyllolepids may have been blind.\n|-\n! [[Ptyctodontida]]\n| [[File:Rhamphodopsis threiplandi.jpg|140px]]<center>''[[Rhamphodopsis|Rhamphodopsis threiplandi]]''</center>\n| [[Ptyctodontida]] (\"folded teeth\") were lightly armoured placoderms with big heads, big eyes and long bodies. They have a strong but superficial resemblance to modern day [[chimaera]]s. Their armour was reduced to a pattern of small plates around the head and neck. Like the extinct and related [[acanthothoracids]], and the living and unrelated holocephalians, most of the ptyctodontids are thought to have lived near the sea bottom and preyed on [[shellfish]]. On account of their lack of armour, some paleontologists have suggested that the Ptyctodontida were not placoderms, but [[holocephalians]] or the ancestors of holocephalians. Anatomical examinations of whole fossil specimens have shown that the similarities between these two groups are superficial. The major differences were that holocephalians have [[shagreen]] on their skin, while ptyctodontids do not; the armoured plates and scales of holocephalians are made of [[dentine]], while those of ptyctodontids are made of bone; the craniums of holocephalians are similar to sharks, while those of ptyctodontids are similar to those of other placoderms; and, most importantly, that holocephalians have true teeth, while ptyctodonts have beak-like tooth plates. Ptyctodontids were [[sexually dimorphic]], with the males having pelvic [[clasper]]s and possibly claspers on the head as well.\n|-\n! [[Rhenanida]]\n| [[File:Asterosteus stenocephalus.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Asterosteus]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Rhenanida]] (\"[[Rhine]] fish\") were flattened, [[Batoidea|ray-like]], bottom-dwelling [[predator]]s with large, upturned mouths that lived in marine environments. The rhenanids were once presumed to be the most primitive, or at least the closest to the ancestral placoderm, as their armour was made of unfused components\u2014a mosaic of tubercles\u2014as opposed to the solidified plates of \"advanced\" placoderms, such as [[antiarch]]s and [[arthrodire]]s. However, through comparisons of skull anatomies, rhenanids are now considered to be the sister group of the antiarchs. When rhenanids die, their \"mosaics\" come apart, and it has been suggested that the rarity of rhenanids in the fossil record reflects postmortem disassociation, and is not an actual rarity of the species.\n|-\n! [[Acanthothoraci]]\n| [[File:Palaeacanthaspis vasta.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Palaeacanthaspis]]''</center>\n| [[Acanthothoraci]] (\"spine chests\") were a group of [[Chimaera|chimaera-like]] placoderms closely related to the rhenanid placoderms. Superficially, acanthoracids resembled scaly [[chimaera]]s or small, scaly arthrodires with blunt [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrums]]. They were distinguished from chimaeras by a pair of large spines that emanate from their chests, the presence of large scales and plates, tooth-like beak plates, and the typical bone-enhanced placoderm eyeball. They were distinguished from other placoderms due to differences in the anatomy of their skulls, and due to patterns on the skull plates and thoracic plates that are unique to this order. From what can be inferred from the mouthplates of fossil specimens, acanthothoracids were shellfish hunters ecologically similar to modern-day chimaeras. Competition with their relatives, the ptyctodont placoderms, may have been one of the main reasons for the acanthothoracids' extinction prior to the mid-Devonian extinction event.\n|-\n! [[Petalichthyida]]\n| [[File:Lunaspis.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Lunaspis]]''</center>\n| [[Petalichthyida]] (\"thin-plated fish\") were small, flattened placoderms, typified by their splayed fins and numerous tubercles that decorated all of the plates and scales of their armour. They reached a peak in diversity during the [[Early Devonian]] and were found throughout the world. The petalichthids ''[[Lunaspis]]'' and ''Wijdeaspis'' are among the best known. There was an independent diversification event that occurred in what is now Southern China, producing a handful of unique genera that were once placed in their own order, \"Quasipetalichthyida\", named after the first discovered species there, ''[[Quasipetalichthys haikouensis]]''. Soon after the petalichthids' diversification, they went into decline. Because they had compressed body forms, it is supposed they were bottom-dwellers that pursued or ambushed smaller fish. Their diet is not clear, as none of the fossil specimens found have preserved mouth parts.\n|-\n! [[Pseudopetalichthyida|Pseudo-<br />petalichthyida]]<br />?\n| [[File:Pseudopetalichthys problematica.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Pseudopetalicthys problematica]]''</center>\n| valign=top | [[Pseudopetalichthyida]] (\"false petalichthyids\") is a group of elongated, possibly flattened fishes comprising three, poorly preserved and poorly studied genera. It is known only from rare fossils in Lower Devonian strata in [[Hunsr\u00fcck]], Germany. Like ''[[Stensioella heintzi]]'', and the [[Rhenanida]], the pseudopetalichthids had armour made up of a mosaic of tubercles. Like ''[[Stensioella heintzi]]'', the pseudopetalichthids' placement within Placodermi is suspect. The matter is not easy to resolve because there are no complete, undamaged and articulated specimens. The anatomical studies done on the crushed specimens that have been found indicate that if they are placoderms, they may be a group more advanced than the [[ptyctodont]]s. As such, placoderm experts consider [[Pseudopetalichthyida]] to be the sister group of the [[Arthrodires]] + [[Phyllolepida]] + [[Antiarchi]] [[Speciation#Genetics|trichotomy]] and the [[Acanthothoraci]] + [[Rhenanida]] [[dichotomy]].\n|-\n! [[Stensioellida]]<br />?\n| [[File:Stensioella heintzi.jpg|80px|center]]<center>''[[Stensioella heintzi]]''</center>\n| [[Stensioellida]] (\"[Heintz's] little [[Erik Stensio|Stensio]]\") contains another problematic placoderm of uncertain affinity, known only from the [[Lower Devonian]] [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] slates of Germany. ''Stensioella'' was a thin fish that, when alive, looked vaguely like an elongated [[chimaeridae|ratfish]], or a skinny ''[[Gemuendina]]'' with thin, strap-like pectoral fins. Similar to those of the Rhenanida, its armour was a complex mosaic of small, scale-like tubercles. The shoulder joints of its armour are similar to other placoderms, and there are superficial similarities in skull plates, and even more superficial similarities between its tubercles and the tubercles of the [[rhenanids]]. It is tentatively placed within Placodermi as a primitive placoderm, though some paleontologists believe the rationale for the placement is inadequate. The paleontologist [[Philippe Janvier]] has suggested that ''Stensioella'' is not a placoderm, but instead is a [[holocephali]]an. If this is true, then the holocephalians diverged from sharks before the [[Chondrichthyes|Chondrichthyan]] [[Devonian]] radiation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://tolweb.org/onlinecontributors/app?service=external/ContributorDetailPage&sp=488&sp=X | title=Philippe Janvier Tree of Life Contributor Profile}}</ref> Critics of Janvier's position say that aside from a [[bodyplan]] superficially similar to primitive [[Holocephali|holocephalians]], the two groups have little else in common anatomically.\n|}\n\n==Cladogram==\nThe following [[cladogram]] shows the interrelationships of placoderms according to Carr ''et al.''
