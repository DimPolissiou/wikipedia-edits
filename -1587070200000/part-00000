The Bears entered the season looking to repeat as [[Super Bowl XX|Super Bowl champions]], as they had won in [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]]. Chicago managed to finish 14\u20132, one game off of their 1985 record of 15\u20131. Although the Bears had an equal 14-2 record as the [[1986 New York Giants|New York Giants]] for the league\u2019s best record, the Giants were seeded number one in the NFC for the playoffs due to the Giants having a better conference record (11-1) than that of the Bears (10-2).\n\nAfter winning the [[Super Bowl XX|championship]] in [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]], the Bears seemed like a dynasty in the making. However, quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] showed up to training camp 25 pounds overweight&nbsp;\u2013 the product of the post-Super Bowl partying he\u2019d partaken in. Nonetheless, he was once again named as the starter. Injuries, however, derailed his season. McMahon played in only six of the team\u2019s first 12 games.\n\nAided by a strong [[offensive line]], the Bears were once again led on offense by [[Walter Payton]]. Payton remained his usual stellar self, posting his 10th and final 1,000-yard season. With McMahon\u2019s poor play, as well as the equally poor play of backups [[Mike Tomczak]], [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]] and [[Doug Flutie]], Payton was the sole spark on offense, which ranked 13th in the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\nAs had been the case the year before, the Bears were once again led by their explosive defense. Any shortcomings on the offensive side of the ball were more than made up for on the defensive side. They once again were ranked #1 in the NFL. The Bears\u2019 defense became the third defense in the history of the NFL to lead the league in fewest points allowed and fewest total yards allowed for two consecutive seasons.<ref>''The Best Show

by any team in the 1980s (other than the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]) \u2013 even fewer than the 198 points the Bears allowed in their historic 1985 season.\n\nHowever, the Bears were not able to recapture their magic from the season before and were bounced from the playoffs in their first game by [[1986 Washington Redskins season|the Washington

A holding penalty and a missed field goal by [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] frustrated the Bears in the first quarter. They still, however, managed to take a 13\u20137 lead into halftime. But their usually stout defense fell apart in the second half, allowing the Redskins to score 20 unanswered points.\n\n\u201cMaybe my dreams didn\u2019t come true\u201c, said Chicago Coach [[Mike Ditka]]. \u201cThe defense has to play outstanding and today they were just not up to the way the Redskins were playing.\u201d\n\nDespite injuries to Redskins [[offensive linemen]] [[Joe Jacoby]] and [[Russ Grimm]], the Washington offensive line was able to pick up the Bears patented blitzes. Washington quarterback [[Jay Schroeder]] was sacked only twice. He was also able to use the blitzes to his advantage, completing passes while being chased out of the pocket.\n\nTrailing 14\u201313 in the 4th quarter, the Bears good fortune ran out, when the usually dependable Payton lost a fumble, which led to an 83-yard touchdown drive by the Redskins. The long drive perpetrated against the NFL\u2019s best defense seemed to take the wind out of the Bears' sails. A few minutes later, the Bears muffed a punt return which set up an easy field goal for the Redskins. The Bears lost 27\u201313.\n\n==Standings==\n{{1986 NFC Central standings}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/1986chicagobears.aspx 1986 Chicago Bears Season at www.bearshistory.com]\n\n{{Chicago Bears}}\n{{Chicago Bears seasons}}\n{{1986 NFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1986 Chicago Bears Season}}\n[[Category:NFC Central championship seasons]]\n[[Category:1986 National Football League season by team|Chicago Bears]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears seasons]]\n[[Category:1986 in sports in Illinois|Chicago]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NFL season\n| team = Chicago Bears\n| logo = Chicago Bears logo.svg\n| year = 1986\n| record = 14\u20132\n| division_place = 1st [[NFC Central]]\n| coach = [[Mike Ditka]]<br>''(5th season)''\n| general manager = [[Jerry Vainisi]]<br>''(Since 1983)''\n| owner = [[Virginia Halas McCaskey|The McCaskey Family]]<br>''(Family control since 1921;  Virginia McCaskey since 1983)''\n| stadium = [[Soldier Field]]\n| pro bowlers = {{Collapsible list\n |title = 7<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1986/probowl.htm |title=1986 NFL Pro Bowlers |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n |1 = RB [[Walter Payton]]\n |2 = LT [[Jim Covert|Jimbo Covert]]\n |3 = C [[Jay Hilgenberg]]\n |4 = DT [[Steve McMichael]]\n |5 = LB [[Wilber Marshall]]\n |6 = MLB [[Mike Singletary]]\n |7 = SS [[Dave Duerson]]\n }}\n| AP All-pros =  {{Collapsible list\n |title = 11<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1986/allpro.htm |title=1986 NFL All-Pros |publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n |1 = WR [[Dennis Gentry]]\n |2 = RB [[Walter Payton]]\n |3 = RB [[Neal Anderson]]\n |4 = LT [[Jim Covert|Jimbo Covert]]\n |5 = C [[Jay Hilgenberg]]\n |6 = DE [[Dan Hampton]]\n |7 = DT [[Steve McMichael]]\n |8 = LB [[Wilber Marshall]]\n |9 = MLB [[Mike Singletary]]\n |10 = CB [[Mike Richardson (American football, born 1961)|Mike Richardson]]\n |11 = SS [[Dave Duerson]]\n }}\n| playoffs = Lost [[1986\u201387 NFL playoffs|Divisional Playoffs]] ([[1986 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]]) 27\u201313\n| shortnavlink = Bears seasons\n}}\nThe '''[[1986 NFL season|1986]] [[Chicago Bears]] season''' was their 67th [[Regular Season (NFL)|regular season]] and 17th [[NFL playoffs|post-season]] completed in the [[National Football League]]. The Bears entered the season looking to repeat as [[Super Bowl XX|Super Bowl champions]], as they had won in [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]]. Chicago managed to finish 14\u20132, one game off of their 1985 record of 15\u20131. Although the Bears had an equal 14-2 record as the [[1986 New York Giants|the New York Giants]] for the league\u2019s best record, the Giants were seeded number one in the NFC for the playoffs due to the Giants having a better conference record (11-1) than that of the Bears (10-2).\n\nAfter winning the [[Super Bowl XX|championship]] in [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]], the Bears seemed like a dynasty in the making. However, quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] showed up to training camp 25 pounds overweight&nbsp;\u2013 the product of the post-Super Bowl partying he\u2019d partaken in. Nonetheless, he was once again named as the starter. Injuries, however, derailed his season. McMahon played in only six of the team\u2019s first 12 games.\n\nAided by a strong [[offensive line]], the Bears were once again led on offense by [[Walter Payton]]. Payton remained his usual stellar self, posting his 10th and final 1,000-yard season. With McMahon\u2019s poor play, as well as the equally poor play of backups [[Mike Tomczak]], [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]] and [[Doug Flutie]], Payton was the sole spark on offense, which ranked 13th in the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\nAs had been the case the year before, the Bears were once again led by their explosive defense. Any shortcomings on the offensive side of the ball were more than made up for on the defensive side. They once again were ranked #1 in the NFL. The Bears\u2019 defense became the third defense in the history of the NFL to lead the league in fewest points allowed and fewest total yards allowed for two consecutive seasons.<ref>''The Best Show in Football: The 1946\u20131955 Cleveland Browns'', p. 294, Andy Piascik, Taylor Trade Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58979-360-6}}</ref> The Bears\u2019 187 points allowed is the fewest surrendered by any team in the 1980s (other than the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]]) \u2013 even fewer than the 198 points the Bears allowed in their historic 1985 season.\n\nHowever, the Bears were not able to recapture their magic from the season before and were bounced from the playoffs in their first game by [[1986 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].\n\n==1986 NFL Draft==\n\n{{main article|1986 NFL Draft}}\n{{NFL team draft start\n|teamname=Chicago Bears\n|year=1986\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round = [[List of Chicago Bears

A holding penalty and a missed field goal by [[Kevin Butler (American football)|Kevin Butler]] frustrated the Bears in the first quarter. They still, however, managed to take a 13\u20137 lead into halftime. But their usually stout defense fell apart in the second half, allowing the Redskins to score 20 unanswered points.\n\n\u201cMaybe my dreams didn\u2019t come true\u201c, said Chicago Coach [[Mike Ditka]]. \u201cThe defense has to play outstanding and today they were just not up to the way the Redskins were playing.\u201d\n\nDespite injuries to Redskins [[offensive linemen]] [[Joe Jacoby]] and [[Russ Grimm]], the Washington offensive line was able to pick up the Bears patented blitzes. Washington quarterback [[Jay Schroeder]] was sacked only twice. He was also able to use the blitzes to his advantage, completing passes while being chased out of the pocket.\n\nTrailing 14\u201313 in the 4th quarter, the Bears good fortune ran out, when the usually dependable Payton lost a fumble, which led to an 83-yard touchdown drive by the Redskins. The long drive perpetrated against the NFL\u2019s best defense seemed to take the wind out of the Bears' sails. A few minutes later, the Bears muffed a punt return which set up an easy field goal for the Redskins.

These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex.

These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex.

He played [[college football]] for [[Oklahoma State University]], and was twice recognized as an [[All-American]]. He was drafted by the [[Seattle Seahawks]] with the sixth overall pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]], and has also played for the [[Denver Broncos]] and the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].\n\n==Early years==\nOkung was born in [[Houston, Texas]].  He attended [[George Bush High School]] in Fort Bend, where he was a first-team All-Greater Houston and first-team all-district selection.  He was also one of the state's top performers in the [[discus throw]] (PR of 47.50 meters). Considered a three-star prospect by ''[[Rivals.com]]'',<ref>{{citation |title=Russell Okung Profile |url=https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewprospect.asp?pr_key=40016&sport=1 |work=Rivals.com |accessdate= }}</ref> Okung was listed as the No. 33 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2006.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/viewrank.asp?ra_key=1150 |title=Offensive tackles 2006 |work=Rivals.com |date=January 30, 2006 }}.</ref>  At {{convert|250|lb|kg|0}} coming out of high school, he did not possess the prototypical tackle bulk.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/ncf/recruiting/tracker/player?recruitId=35168 |work=ESPN |title=Russell Okung Recruiting Profile |date=February 1, 2006 }}.</ref>  Okung was recruited by a number of major schools, including [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], and [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln|Nebraska]]. He committed to Oklahoma State in January 2006.\n\n==College career==\nOkung attended [[Oklahoma State University]], where he played for coach [[Mike Gundy]]'s [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football]] team from 2006 to 2009.  As a [[true freshman]], he moved into the starting lineup for the first time against [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] and held the position of right tackle for the rest of the season (eight straight starts). He ended the season by being voted as a member of All-Big 12 freshman team (by ''[[The Sporting News]]'') and was named the Dick Bogert Award winner as Oklahoma State's top freshman.\n\nIn his sophomore season, he started all thirteen games, having been moved permanently to left tackle. The Cowboys\u2019 offensive line gave up just five sacks in eight Big 12 games to lead the league in that category. Okung earned honorable mention all-Big 12 honors (by coaches). He was also named to the ''Rivals.com'' all-bowl team after holding Indiana's [[Greg Middleton]], the NCAA's sack leader, without a tackle in the [[2007 Insight Bowl]] victory.<ref>{{Citation |work=Rivals.com |date=January 9, 2008 |title=Coming up big in the biggest games |url=http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&CID=759478 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520153800/http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&CID=759478 |archivedate=May 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Russel Okung Broncos Practice 2016 - 2.jpg|thumb|left]]\nAs a junior, Okung led Oklahoma State with 71 knockdown blocks, and was named a first-team all-conference selection by the coaches.

games in his first NFL season high-ankle sprains on both ankles, but played well in the remaining 10. He saw limited action in the Seahawks' fourth game of the season in St. Louis against the Rams on October 3, before leaving the game in the first half after re-injuring his ankle.\n\nOkung started the first twelve games in the 2011 regular season for the Seahawks. On December 1, 2011, he suffered a season-ending injury late in Seattle's 31-14 victory over Philadelphia.

He was put on Injury Reserve after the game.\n\nOkung started 15 games in the 2012 regular season for the Seahawks.

There is another short tunnel near the top of Mount Messenger]]\nThe highway leaves SH 1 at Hamilton, and initially heads south through farmland, passing through [[Te Awamutu]]. Sections of this stretch of the road are four-laned, but not divided carriageway. From [[Otorohanga]] it follows the valley of the [[Waipa River]] to [[Te Kuiti]]. The road then turns southwest through sparsely settled farmland, crossing several ridges before following the Awakino gorge to reach the coast, which it follows around the North Taranaki Bight. At the [[Tongaporutu River]] the highway turns inland to avoid coastal cliffs and climbs over Mount Messenger before descending via the [[Mimi River (New Zealand)|Mimi River]] valley to return to the coast near [[Urenui]]. Bypassing [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]], it reaches [[New Plymouth]] then turns inland, passing to the east of [[Mount Taranaki]] via [[Inglewood, New Zealand|Inglewood]], [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] and [[Eltham, New Zealand|Eltham]] to [[Hawera]].\n\nFrom Hawera the highway follows the coast of the South Taranaki Bight southeastwards to [[Patea]] and [[Whanganui]] before meeting SH 1 again at [[Bulls, New Zealand|Bulls]]. SH 1 and 3 share their route for 6&nbsp;km as they cross the [[Rangitikei River]] to [[Sanson, New Zealand|Sanson]], where SH 3 continues southeast towards [[Palmerston North]]. After crossing the [[Manawatu River]], the route follows its south bank through the [[Manawatu Gorge]] to its terminus and junction with [[New Zealand State Highway 2|SH 2]] at [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]] in the [[Tararua District]]\n\nBoth the Awakino and Manawatu gorges are prone to closure by slips and rockslides in heavy rain.\n\n==Route changes==\nConstruction of a bypass of [[Bell Block, Taranaki|Bell Block]], a satellite town of New Plymouth, was completed in 2010.

There is another short tunnel near the top of Mount Messenger]]\nThe highway leaves SH 1 at Hamilton, and initially heads south through farmland, passing through [[Te Awamutu]]. Sections of this stretch of the road are four-laned, but not divided carriageway. From [[Otorohanga]] it follows the valley of the [[Waipa River]] to [[Te Kuiti]]. The road then turns southwest through sparsely settled farmland, crossing several ridges before following the Awakino gorge to reach the coast, which it follows around the North Taranaki Bight. At the [[Tongaporutu River]] the highway turns inland to avoid coastal cliffs and climbs over Mount Messenger before descending via the [[Mimi River (New Zealand)|Mimi River]] valley to return to the coast near [[Urenui]]. Bypassing [[Waitara, New Zealand|Waitara]], it reaches [[New Plymouth]] then turns inland, passing to the east of [[Mount Taranaki]] via [[Inglewood, New Zealand|Inglewood]], [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] and [[Eltham, New Zealand|Eltham]] to [[Hawera]].\n\nFrom Hawera the highway follows the coast of the South Taranaki Bight southeastwards to [[Patea]] and [[Whanganui]] before meeting SH 1 again at [[Bulls, New Zealand|Bulls]]. SH 1 and 3 share their route for 6&nbsp;km as they cross the [[Rangitikei River]] to [[Sanson, New Zealand|Sanson]], where SH 3 continues southeast towards [[Palmerston North]]. After crossing the [[Manawatu River]], the route follows its south bank through the [[Manawatu Gorge]] to its terminus and junction with [[New Zealand State Highway 2|SH 2]] at [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]] in the [[Tararua District]]\n\nBoth the Awakino and Manawatu gorges are prone to closure by slips and rockslides in heavy rain.\n\n==Route changes==\nConstruction of a bypass of [[Bell Block, Taranaki|Bell Block]], a satellite town of New Plymouth, was completed in 2010.

In 1949, Palmer moved with his family from Batley, where he was born, to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Influenced as a child by blues, soul and jazz music on [[American Forces Network|American Forces Radio]], Robert Palmer joined his first band, The Mandrakes, at the age of 15 whilst still at [[Graham School|Scarborough High School for Boys]].

In 1949, Palmer moved with his family from Batley, where he was born, to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Influenced as a child by blues, soul and jazz music on [[American Forces Network|American Forces Radio]], Robert Palmer joined his first band, The Mandrakes, at the age of 15 whilst still at [[Graham School|Scarborough High School for Boys]].

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&pg=PA67&dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun#v=onepage&q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun Lundquist, John M.

There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles.  An ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, [[1 Esdras]], suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:<ref>{{bible|1 Esdras|1:54}}</ref>\n{{quote|And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon}}\n\nIn [[Rabbinic literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.<ref>Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)</ref> This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, state that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.\n\n==Archaeology==\nArchaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at [[Kiriath-Jearim]] in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. [[Thomas R\u00f6mer]] suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of [[King Josiah]].  He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3<ref>{{bible|2 Chronicles|35:3}}</ref> indicates that it was moved during King Josiah's reign.<ref name=David>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/MAGAZINE-the-real-ark-of-the-covenant-may-have-housed-pagan-gods-1.5446116|title=The Real Ark of the Covenant may have Housed Pagan Gods|newspaper=Haaretz|author=Ariel David|date=30 Aug 2017}}</ref> Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century in a text referred to as the \"Ark Narrative\" and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.<ref>K. L. Sparks, \"Ark of the Covenant\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Historical Books'' (InterVarsity Press, 2005), 91.</ref>\n\nThomas R\u00f6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones \"of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins\", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.<ref>Thomas R\u00f6mer, ''The Invention of God'' (Harvard University Press, 2015), 93.</ref> In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices \"remain unconvincing\" in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark's distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests \"contained no box, no lid, and no poles,\" they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have [[kerubim]] figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels. Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|bark]] is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barks had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenental tablets inside the ark.<ref>Scott Noegel, \"The Egyptian Origin of the Ark of the Covenant\" in Thomas E.

Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the [[Great Zimbabwe civilization]].

Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&pg=PA67&dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun#v=onepage&q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun Lundquist, John M.

Knaphus]], located on [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n\nThe '''Mormon pioneers''' were members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), also known as [[Latter Day Saint|Latter-day Saints]], who [[Human migration|migrated]] in the mid-1840s across the [[United States]] from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in what is today the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]]. At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the [[History of Mexico#First Republic|Republic of Mexico]], which soon after went to [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with the United States]] over the annexation of Texas. Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war.\n\nThe journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church's leader [[Joseph Smith]] made it clear that the group could not remain in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]{{mdash}}which the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the [[Missouri Mormon War]], setting off the [[Illinois Mormon War]]. The well-organized [[wagon train]] migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the ''Mormon Exodus'' is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so [[Emigrant Trail|wagon train migrations]] to the [[Western United States|far west]] continued sporadically until the 20th century.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Background of the migration==\n[[File:LDS1846-1869.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS Church between 1846 and 1869. Also shown are a portion of the route followed by the Mormon Battalion and the path followed by the handcart companies to the Mormon Trail.]]\n\nSince its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church were often harshly treated by their neighbors, partially due to their religious beliefs, sometimes as a reaction against the actions and the words of the church leaders and members. These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another\u2014to [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], and then to [[Illinois]], where they built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the First Counselor in the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the [[Salt Sermon]] and the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]].<ref>[[s:Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri]], 1838</ref> These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in [[Liberty Jail]]. Rigdon was released on a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made his way to [[Illinois]], where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], were [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed]] by a mob while in custody in the city of [[Carthage, Illinois]]. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] in [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]].\n\nAccording to church belief, God inspired [[Brigham Young]], (Joseph Smith's successor as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]]), to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then [[Mexico]], though the U.S. Army had already [[Capture of Santa Fe|captured Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the settled parts of [[Alta California]] in late 1846). During the winter of 1846\u201347, Latter-day Saint leaders in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] and [[Iowa]] laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the [[James K. Polk|Polk]] administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]]. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \"American [[Moses]].\"\n\nYoung personally reviewed all available information on the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the [[Great Basin]], consulting with [[mountain man|mountain men]] and [[Trapping (Animal)|trappers]] who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.\n\n==Vanguard company of 1847==\nBrigham Young organized a [[wikt:vanguard#English|vanguard]] company to break the trail west to the [[Rocky Mountains]], gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and native tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] and [[Ferry|ferries]] and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River]] was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, Church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.\n\n[[File:Winter Quarters by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Winter Quarters]]\nIn April 1847, Young consulted with members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] who had recently returned from the British mission. [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Hyde]] brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on [[John C. Fremont]]'s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] danger, a [[militia]] and night guard was formed under the direction of [[Stephen Markham]].\n\n[[File:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska]]\n\nOn April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5&nbsp;km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters ''for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed.'' <ref>May, Dean L. ''Utah: A People's History'' p. 57.

The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nSome camp members were assigned specific tasks. [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]] was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with [[Orson Pratt]], an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the ''roadometer'', is the basis for most modern [[odometer]]s. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The ''roadometer'' showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west.\n\nWomen of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from [[Mississippi]] who merged with the main party at [[Laramie, Wyoming]].\n\n[[File:Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley]]\n\nThe first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to [[Fort Laramie]], took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Also traveling in the new group were Church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming|Ft. Bridger]]. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of [[Thomas Grover]] were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.\n\nDuring the last week of June, [[Sam Brannan]], leader of the Mormon emigrant ship ''Brooklyn'', met the company near [[Green River, Wyoming]]. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today [[San Francisco, California]]. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader's focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.\n\nThe vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner-Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper [[Miles Goodyear]], who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" probably induced by wood [[tick]]s. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.\n\nIn July 1847 the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ''...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view.'' The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19&nbsp;km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.\n\nOn July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \"This is the right place, drive on.\" Today a [[This is the Place Monument|monument]] stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.\n\nOn July 28, Young established a location for the future [[Salt Lake Temple]] and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.<ref>Walker and Dant, p. 318</ref>\n\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.\n\n==Travel conditions==\nThe pioneers traveled to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcarts]], and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.<ref group=notes>According to the American Studies researchers involved with the [[Oregon Trail II]] game, such wagons had a cargo capacity of about 3,000 pounds and weighed another thousand themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}</ref> Their trail along the north bank of the [[Platte River]] and [[North Platte River]] and over the [[continental divide]] climbing up to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] and [[Pacific Springs]] from [[Fort Laramie|Fort John]] along the valley of the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and then down to [[Fort Bridger]] and thence down to the [[Great Salt Lake]] became known as the [[Mormon Trail]].\n\nFinancial resources of the church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|-3}} to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were under supplied.\n\nCovered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the ''[[Nauvoo Neighbor]]'' printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15&nbsp;lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.<ref>Slaughter, William and Landon, Michael. \"Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail\". p. 23, 24. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, 1997.</ref>\n\nSeveral later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to [[wheelbarrow]]s) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.\n\nDue to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April\u2013September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.\n\n==The ship ''Brooklyn''{{anchor|The ship Brooklyn}}==\nIn November 1845 [[Samuel Brannan]], newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]'' (later the ''New York Messenger''), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children\u2014238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship ''Brooklyn''.<ref name=\"Sonne, Conway B. pages 33\">Sonne, Conway B.

The ship ''Brooklyn'' sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around [[Cape Horn]], stopping at the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], then to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] ([[Hawaii]]), finally docking in [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now [[San Francisco]]) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.\n\n[[Augusta Joyce Crocheron]], a passenger on the ship ''Brooklyn'', described the voyage:\n{{quote|As for the pleasure of the trip, we met disappointment, for we once lay becalmed in the tropics, and at another time we were \"hatched below\" during a terrific storm. Women and children were at night lashed to their berths, for in no other way could they keep in. Furniture rolled back and forth endangering limb and life. The waves swept the deck and even reached the staterooms... Children's voices were crying in the darkness, mother's voices soothing or scolding, men's voices rising above the others, all mingled with the distressing groans and cries of the sick for help, and, above all, the roaring of the wind and howling of the tempest made a scene and feeling indescribable.<ref name=\"Sonne, Conway B. pages 33\"/>}}\n\nThe passengers of the ship ''Brooklyn'' left the United States with the hope of finding religious freedom. However, they arrived in Mexican [[Alta California]] just weeks after its occupation by the United States Navy at the outset of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers \"felt more cheerful and secure.\" Mormon historian [[B. H. Roberts]] noted in his work ''A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'':\n\n{{quote|On the announcement of the United States naval officer, who boarded the ''Brooklyn'' as she came to anchor, that the emigrants \"were in the United States of America,\" three hearty cheers were given in reply...

They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Brigham Young sent out scouting parties to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the [[Great Basin]] where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas.  As they encountered local populations, they occupied their land, killed resisters and called on the federal government to remove them from their homes.  Mormons believed that God had given the land to them and were prepared to kill the Native Americans in order to take possession of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-mormons-and-the-indians/|title=Establishing Zion|author=Eugene E.

In 1848, pioneers moved into lands purchased from trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in present-day [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. In 1849, [[Tooele, Utah|Tooele]] and [[Fort Utah]] in modern-day [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] were founded. The settlement of Provo was particularly troubling to the Utes, since it was at the heart of their territory.<ref name=mailed_fist />  [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] chief [[Walkara|Wakara]] suggested the settlers instead move into the Sanpete Valley in central Utah, where the settlers established the community of [[Manti, Utah|Manti]].

In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local native cultures led to outposts in [[Fort Lemhi]] on Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Elk Mountain, Utah|Elk Mountain]] in east-central of present-day Utah.\n\nThe experiences of returning members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. [[Jefferson Hunt]], senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]]. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in [[St. George, Utah]], Las Vegas and [[San Bernardino, California]], as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in [[Mormon colonies in Mexico|northern Mexico]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:BrighamYoungCemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\nThe Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the [[State of Utah]], known as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].

In participating in the trek, the youth dress as pioneers and pack a few things to carry in handcarts. They go on a hike for a couple days so they can experience what the pioneers experienced. During this multi-day event, camp organizers sometimes require youth to avoid the use of technology or anything that the pioneers did not have on their journeys, to enhance the experience.\n\n==Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel Database==\nThe Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers information from journals, church history records, and other materials to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled across the plains to get to Utah.

At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the [[History of Mexico#First Republic|Republic of Mexico]], which soon after went to [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with the United States]] over the annexation of Texas. Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war.\n\nThe journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church's leader [[Joseph Smith]] made it clear that the group could not remain in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]{{mdash}}which the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the [[Missouri Mormon War]], setting off the [[Illinois Mormon War]]. The well-organized [[wagon train]] migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the ''Mormon Exodus'' is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so [[Emigrant Trail|wagon train migrations]] to the [[Western United States|far west]] continued sporadically until the 20th century.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Background of the migration==\n[[File:LDS1846-1869.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS Church between 1846 and 1869. Also shown are a portion of the route followed by the Mormon Battalion and the path followed by the handcart companies to the Mormon Trail.]]\n\nSince its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church were often harshly treated by their neighbors, partially due to their religious beliefs, sometimes as a reaction against the actions and the words of the church leaders and members. These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another\u2014to [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], and then to [[Illinois]], where they built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the First Counselor in the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the [[Salt Sermon]] and the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]].<ref>[[s:Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri]], 1838</ref> These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in [[Liberty Jail]]. Rigdon was released on a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made his way to [[Illinois]], where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], were [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed]] by a mob while in custody in the city of [[Carthage, Illinois]]. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] in [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]].\n\nAccording to church belief, God inspired [[Brigham Young]], (Joseph Smith's successor as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]]), to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then [[Mexico]], though the U.S. Army had already [[Capture of Santa Fe|captured Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the settled parts of [[Alta California]] in late 1846). During the winter of 1846\u201347, Latter-day Saint leaders in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] and [[Iowa]] laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the [[James K. Polk|Polk]] administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]]. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \"American [[Moses]].\"\n\nYoung personally reviewed all available information on the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the [[Great Basin]], consulting with [[mountain man|mountain men]] and [[Trapping (Animal)|trappers]] who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.\n\n==Vanguard company of 1847==\nBrigham Young organized a [[wikt:vanguard#English|vanguard]] company to break the trail west to the [[Rocky Mountains]], gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and native tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] and [[Ferry|ferries]] and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River]] was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, Church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.\n\n[[File:Winter Quarters by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Winter Quarters]]\nIn April 1847, Young consulted with members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] who had recently returned from the British mission. [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Hyde]] brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on [[John C. Fremont]]'s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] danger, a [[militia]] and night guard was formed under the direction of [[Stephen Markham]].\n\n[[File:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska]]\n\nOn April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5&nbsp;km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters ''for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed.'' <ref>May, Dean L. ''Utah: A People's History'' p. 57. Bonneville Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87480-284-9}}.</ref> Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m.. Each day's travel ended at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m.. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nSome camp members were assigned specific tasks. [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]] was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with [[Orson Pratt]], an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the ''roadometer'', is the basis for most modern [[odometer]]s. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The ''roadometer'' showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west.\n\nWomen of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from [[Mississippi]] who merged with the main party at [[Laramie, Wyoming]].\n\n[[File:Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley]]\n\nThe first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to [[Fort Laramie]], took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Also traveling in the new group were Church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming|Ft. Bridger]]. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of [[Thomas Grover]] were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.\n\nDuring the last week of June, [[Sam Brannan]], leader of the Mormon emigrant ship ''Brooklyn'', met the company near [[Green River, Wyoming]]. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today [[San Francisco, California]]. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader's focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.\n\nThe vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner-Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper [[Miles Goodyear]], who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" probably induced by wood [[tick]]s. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.\n\nIn July 1847 the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ''...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view.'' The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19&nbsp;km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.\n\nOn July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \"This is the right place, drive on.\" Today a [[This is the Place Monument|monument]] stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.\n\nOn July 28, Young established a location for the future [[Salt Lake Temple]] and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.<ref>Walker and Dant, p. 318</ref>\n\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.\n\n==Travel conditions==\nThe pioneers traveled to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcarts]], and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.<ref group=notes>According to the American Studies researchers involved with the [[Oregon Trail II]] game, such wagons had a cargo capacity of about 3,000 pounds and weighed another thousand themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}</ref> Their trail along the north bank of the [[Platte River]] and [[North Platte River]] and over the [[continental divide]] climbing up to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] and [[Pacific Springs]] from [[Fort Laramie|Fort John]] along the valley of the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and then down to [[Fort Bridger]] and thence down to the [[Great Salt Lake]] became known as the [[Mormon Trail]].\n\nFinancial resources of the Church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|-3}} to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were under supplied.\n\nCovered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the ''[[Nauvoo Neighbor]]'' printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15&nbsp;lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.<ref>Slaughter, William and Landon, Michael. \"Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail\". p. 23, 24. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, 1997.</ref>\n\nSeveral later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to [[wheelbarrow]]s) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.\n\nDue to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April\u2013September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.\n\n==The ship ''Brooklyn''{{anchor|The ship Brooklyn}}==\nIn November 1845 [[Samuel Brannan]], newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]'' (later the ''New York Messenger''), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children\u2014238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship ''Brooklyn''.<ref name=\"Sonne, Conway B. pages 33\">Sonne, Conway B.

The ship ''Brooklyn'' sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around [[Cape Horn]], stopping at the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], then to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] ([[Hawaii]]), finally docking in [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now [[San Francisco]]) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.\n\n[[Augusta Joyce Crocheron]], a passenger on the ship ''Brooklyn'', described the voyage:\n{{quote|As for the pleasure of the trip, we met disappointment, for we once lay becalmed in the tropics, and at another time we were \"hatched below\" during a terrific storm.

However, they arrived in Mexican [[Alta California]] just weeks after its occupation by the United States Navy at the outset of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers \"felt more cheerful and secure.\" Mormon historian [[B. H. Roberts]] noted in his work ''A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'':\n\n{{quote|On the announcement of the United States naval officer, who boarded the ''Brooklyn'' as she came to anchor, that the emigrants \"were in the United States of America,\" three hearty cheers were given in reply...

They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Brigham Young sent out scouting parties to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the [[Great Basin]] where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas.  As they encountered local populations, they occupied their land, killed resisters and called on the federal government to remove them from their homes.  Mormons believed that God had given the land to them and were prepared to kill the Native Americans in order to take possession of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-mormons-and-the-indians/|title=Establishing Zion|author=Eugene E.

In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local native cultures led to outposts in [[Fort Lemhi]] on Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Elk Mountain, Utah|Elk Mountain]] in east-central of present-day Utah.\n\nThe experiences of returning members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. [[Jefferson Hunt]], senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]]. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in [[St. George, Utah]], Las Vegas and [[San Bernardino, California]], as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in [[Mormon colonies in Mexico|northern Mexico]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:BrighamYoungCemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\nThe Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the [[State of Utah]], known as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].

It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the wagon trains that brought them to Utah.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/overlandtravel/|title=Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel|work=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=LDS Church History\n}}\n{{Portal|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[American pioneer]]\n* [[Come, Come, Ye Saints]] (hymn about pioneer migration)\n* [[Daughters of the Utah Handcart Pioneers]]\n* [[Daughters of Utah Pioneers]]\n* [[Haun's Mill massacre]]\n* [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement]]\n* [[History of Utah]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Mormon handcart pioneers]]\n* [[Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area]]\n* [[Mormon Trail]]\n* [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]\n* [[Pioneer Day (Utah)]]\n* [[Sons of Utah Pioneers]]\n* [[This Is The Place Heritage Park]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Barney, Ronald O., editor.
