{"title_page": "Contact sport", "text_new": "{{see also|combat sport}}\n{{short description|Sport that emphasizes or requires physical contact between players}}\n'''Contact sports''' are [[sport]]s that emphasize or require physical contact between players. Some sports, such as [[mixed martial arts]], are scored on impacting an opponent, while others, including [[rugby football|rugby]],  require [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]] of players. These sports are often known as full-contact, as the sport cannot be undertaken without contact. Other sports have contact, but such events are illegal under the rules of the game or are accidental and do not form part of the sport.\n\nThe contact in contact sports can also include impact via a piece of [[sporting equipment]], such as being struck by a [[hockey stick]] or [[football (ball)|football]]. Non-contact sports are those where participants should have no possible means of touching, such as sprinting, swimming, darts or snooker, where players use separate lanes or take turns of play. Consideration should also be given to other sports such as Moto-cross and Bicycle Moto-cross (BMX) and [[cycling]] which all involve riding/racing in packs of riders.  This often results in brushing and bumping off other riders.\n\n==Terminology in the United States==\nCurrent medical terminology in the United States uses the term '''collision sport''' to refer to sports like [[rugby football|rugby]], [[roller derby]], [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], and [[lacrosse]], the term '''contact sport''' to refer to sports such as [[association football]] and [[basketball]], and the term '''limited-contact sport''' to sports like [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[volleyball]] and [[baseball]].<ref name=\"ncbi-pubmed-18381550\">{{cite journal\n| title=Medical conditions affecting sports participation.\n| author=Rice SG.\n| year=2008\n| pmid=18381550\n| doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0080\n| volume=121\n| issue=4\n| journal=Pediatrics\n| pages=841\u20138}}</ref>\nThe [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] policy statement revised in 2008 included the following definitions:\n\n{{quote|In collision sports (eg, boxing, ice hockey, [American] football, lacrosse, and rodeo), athletes purposely hit or collide with each other or with inanimate objects (including the ground) with great force.

The term \"contact sport\" is used in both team sports and combat activities, medical terminology and television game shows, such as [[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]] and [[Wipeout (2008 American game show)|Wipeout]] , to certain degrees. Contact between players is often classed by different grades ranging from non-contact, where there is no contact between players, to full-contact or collision sports, where the rules allow for significant physical contact.\n\nInformation was pulled from 18 different articles regarding the injury rates in professional rugby league football. The 18 different studies were all over one full year of professional rugby league football. But what classifies an injury?\u00a0 Ten of these studies classify an injury as a player missing a competitive game because of it.  Two different people put these statistics together.  In a total of 121819 hours of competitive games were played, there were 517 total injuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11839082/|title=A Pooled Data Analysis of Injury Incidence in Rugby League Football|last=C|first=Gissane|last2=D|first2=Jennings|date=2002|website=Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)|language=en|pmid=11839082|access-date=2020-04-03|last3=K|first3=Kerr|last4=Ja|first4=White}}</ref> That means per every 1000 hours played, there are 40 injuries<ref name=\":0\" />.\u00a0 Also statistics show that the majority of these injuries were to the lower body (below torso).

It was released as the fourth and final 45 rpm single from the band's album ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' in 1977. It was the record's fourth top-ten hit, as the song peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe song was inspired by an affair McVie had with the band's lighting director, Curry Grant.<ref name=\"Furman\" /> \"To avoid flare-ups\", she told her then-husband [[John McVie]] that the song was about her dog.<ref name=\"Caillat\" /> On the [[American Top 40]] program of November 26, 1977, [[Casey Kasem]] described the song as \"an emotional biography of the love lives of all five members.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nEarly tracking of the song was done, according to McVie, in the absence of [[Lindsey Buckingham]], which gave her the freedom to \"build the song on my own\". The recording sessions were saturated with cocaine use. Buckingham played rhythm guitar on a [[Fender Stratocaster]], and tracking was done with a [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer Electric Piano]], Nicks playing tambourine. John McVie's bass was rerecorded again later, and Christine McVie dubbed [[Clavinet|Hohner Clavinet]] parts.<ref name=\"Caillat\">{{cite book|last1=Caillat|first1=Ken|last2=Stiefel| first2=Steve|title=Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album|url=https://archive.org/details/makingrumoursins00cail|url-access=registration|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118282366|pages=[https://archive.org/details/makingrumoursins00cail/page/101 101], 106\u2013110, 195}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[New York Post]]'' she remarked that she wanted it to be the third US single from the album, but instead \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" was chosen, which boosted the album's commercial success in the US and the UK.<ref name=\"Furman\">{{cite book|last=Furman|first=Leah|title=Rumours Exposed: The Unauthorized Biography of Fleetwood Mac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SW31aVVDc_AC&pg=PA133|year=2003|publisher=Kensington|isbn=9780806524726|pages=105\u2013106, 133\u201334}}</ref> The song also utilizes descending seconds in its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Ken|title=What to Listen for in Rock: A Stylistic Analysis|location=2002|isbn=978-0-300-09239-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/whattolistenfori0000step/page/107 107]|url=https://archive.org/details/whattolistenfori0000step/page/107}}</ref>\n\n\"You Make Loving Fun\" was a concert staple for Fleetwood Mac and was played during every tour involving Christine McVie from 1976 until 1997, a year before McVie's departure from the band and retirement from touring.
