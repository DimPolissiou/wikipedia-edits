Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as \"[[peace lines]]\", erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.<ref name=\"Peacelines\">{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as [[Manchester]] or [[Birmingham]]. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] or the [[Newtownards Road]]) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as \"[[peace lines]]\", erected by the [[British Army]] after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.<ref name=\"Peacelines\">{{Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

V.

Nagam Aiya, during the reign of king Rama Varma besides the troubles caused by confederate chiefs and nobles such as Ettuveetiil Pillas and Madambies, the other petty chieftains were also refracted from contributing to the revenue of the state; and sovereign was unable to defend the atrocities of armed dacoits, as there were not enough money and manpower with the state.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|loc=Chapter VI|p=330}} In Kollavarsham 901 king Rama Varma, headed to Tiruchirappalli and made a pact with the Madurai Nayaks to supply additional forces to Travancore for a fixed annual payment.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|loc=Chapter I|p=109}} T. K. Velu Pillai cites the references of payment to Madurai from Travancore.{{sfnp|Velu Pillai|1940|loc=Modern History|pp=256{{ndash}}259}} In the novel, it is presented that king Rama Varma and Thirumukhathu Pilla proceed to Tiruchirappalli in Kollavarsham 901 to arrange additional forces, which later camps at Boothapandi.\n\n====Lethal attempts on Marthanda Varma====\n\n=====Attempt at a Temple=====\nIn the novel, while Rama Varma and Thirumukhathu Pilla headed to Tiruchirappalli, prince Marthanda Varma and Ananthapadmanabhan were staying at [[Nagercoil]], from where latter among the duo at Nagercoil heads to his mother's house following the news of her illness. While Ananthapadmanabhan was away, the prince was chased away by the men of Padmanabhan Thambi and an attempt on his life was made at Kalliyankattu temple. The incident is further referred as the escape of Marthanda Varma as a Brahmin. Dr. P. Venugopalan cites the references of the incident in the history of Travancore and ''Marthandamahathmyam'' [[Kilippattu]].{{sfnp|''Vy\u0101khy\u0101naku\u1e5fippuka\u1e37''|2009|p=402}} The incident took place at a temple of [[Shiva]] near to [[Kumarakovil]] (2 miles north to [[Thuckalay|Thakkala]]), where Marthanda Varma took shelter while evading the attackers. At the temple Marthanda Varma was aided by the temple priest to escape in the outfit of the latter, and the priest was killed by the attackers as he was in the outfit of the former.{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=26{{ndash}}27|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}}\n\nThere are references in the novel about attempts on the life of Marthanda Varma by his enemies as his successful escapes through the groove at Panathara, the [[Ezhava]] house at Perunkadavila, and the [[Nedumangad]] fort.\n\n=====Escape at an Ezhava house=====\nAccording to the legends, after evading the Ettuveettil Pillas and their men at Dhanuvachapuram,{{refn|name=Dhanuvacharef1|group=upper-alpha|Dhanuvachapuram is a village in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} Eithukondamkani,{{refn|name=Eithukondref1|group=upper-alpha|Eithukondamkani is a locality in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} and Marayamuttom,{{refn|name=Marayamref1|group=upper-alpha|Marayamuttom is a village in [[Neyyattinkara taluk]] of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} when Marthanda Varma was refreshing himself at a river near to Malakulangara{{refn|name=Malakularef1|group=upper-alpha|Malakulangara is a locality in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} he was spotted by the men of Thambi brothers and in urgency to escape from them, he headed into a nearby Ezhava house, Alayil Puthur Veedu at Perumkadavila, where he was aided by the Kalipanikkathi (Lady Kali) to hide under the rattan enclosures. The men of Thambi brothers were unsuccessful in finding the prince.{{sfnp|Naduvattom Gopalakrishnan|2008|loc=\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d30\u0d41\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d1f\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d33 \u0d08\u0d34\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d3f [Ezhava house at Perunkadavila]|pp=61{{ndash}}62}}\n\n=====Aid by a Channan and Hiding inside a tree=====\nIn the novel, while running away from Velu Kuruppu and his men, Marthanda Varma is helped by a mad Channan who hides him in a tree and misdirects his pursuers. According to Dr. P. Venugopalan, the above account of actions is a collaboration of two situations where Marthanda Varma escaped from the enemies.{{sfnp|''Vy\u0101khy\u0101naku\u1e5fippuka\u1e37''|2009|p=402}} Once, when Marthanda Varma was returning after some confidential visits to [[Kanyakumari]] and [[Suchindram]], he was tracked by the men of Ettuveettil Pillas and Thambi brothers. While running away from the chasers, he was suggested by a Channan plougher of the nearby field to hide inside the hollow statue of the elephant at the adjacent temple of [[Ayyappan|Shasthavu]]. When the chasers reached the cultivation field and questioned the plougher, he misdirected them to the southern provinces. In another occasion, when Marthanda Varma was chased by the enemies, he evaded them by hiding inside the big hole within a jack tree at the [[Neyyattinkara Sree Krishna Swami Temple]].{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=26{{ndash}}27|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}} The tree is still preserved at the temple compound and known as Ammaccipl\u0101v\u016d (Mother jack tree).\n\n====Lethal attempt on Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma====\nThe incident is referred as the attempt to murder the little prince, Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma and his mother by Ramanamadathil Pilla along with his men in Kollavarsham 903, while the mother-son duo were heading from Trivandrum to Attingal, but only to evade the attempt with the help of Kilimanoor Koithampuran (Lord of Kilimanoor), who led the duo to a nearby safe village and took their place in the palanquin en route, confronted the attackers and eventually got killed, as described in the ''History of Travancore from the Earliest Times'' by P. Shangoony Menon.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|loc=Chapter I|pp=106, 108, 110}} The above account of incident is in conflict with the version described by [[Vaikkath Pachu Moothathu|Pachumuthathu]] in the ''Tiruvit\u0101\u1e41k\u016b\u1e5f Caritra\u1e41'',{{refn|name=Pachurefn1|group=upper-alpha|First published history of Travancore (in Malayalam) written by Pachu Moothathu in 1867.}} which recounts the same at Budhanoor{{refn|name=Budharef1|group=upper-alpha|Budhanoor is a village in Chengannur taluk of [[Alappuzha district]].}} in the then district of [[Chengannur]], where ruffians from [[Kayamkulam]] did the attack and states that lord of Kilimanoor who defended the attackers was the husband of the Queen. V. Nagam Aiya states the incident inline with the version by P. Shangoony Menon and mentions that lord of Kilimanoor, Kerala Varma Koithampuran as the consort of the Queen.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|loc=Chapter VI|pp=328{{ndash}}330}} T. K. Velu Pillai supports the version of Pachumuthathu and condemns the version by P. Shangoony Menon; which is cited by Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju, who points out the deliberation of T. K. Velu Pillai in supporting the version of Pachumuthathu by purposefully avoiding the references of incident in the British records, ''Letters to Tellicherry''{{refn|name=Telliref1|group=upper-alpha|''Letters to Tellicherry'' are records of [[Madras Presidency]] published as one of the series among ''Records of Fort St. George'' in 12 Volumes by the Superintendent of Government Press, Madras in 1934.}}.{{sfnmp|Velu Pillai|1940|loc=Modern History|1pp=232, 256{{ndash}}261|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|2pp=20{{ndash}}22}}\n\n====Heirship claim by Thambi brothers====\nDr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju refers to the legend that Thambi brothers made a claim to the throne of Venad during the final period of king Rama Varma as they were the linear descendants, which was against the tradition of collateral descent through maternal nephew followed by the Venad kingdom in selecting the heir to the throne.{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=28{{ndash}}29|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}} P. K. Parameswaran Nair claims that there is a legend in which Rama Varma promises to his spouse, Abhirama to let the children she will bear, to ascend to the throne of Venad; however Dr. P. Venugopalan states that the above account of legend is not valid as Rama Varma was neither the king nor the next heir to the throne during the early days of his relationship with his spouse and he ruled the kingdom only in the last five years of his life.{{sfnmp|''C. V. Raman Pilla''|1959|1p=131|''M\u0101\u1e5ftt\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u1e5fmma: Sr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6diyu\u1e41 svar\u016bpavu\u1e41''|2009|2p=87}} P. Shangoony Menon and V.

Nagam Aiya, during the reign of king Rama Varma besides the troubles caused by confederate chiefs and nobles such as Ettuveetiil Pillas and Madambies, the other petty chieftains were also refracted from contributing to the revenue of the state; and sovereign was unable to defend the atrocities of armed dacoits, as there were not enough money and manpower with the state.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|loc=Chapter VI|p=330}} In Kollavarsham 901 king Rama Varma, headed to Tiruchirappalli and made a pact with the Madurai Nayaks to supply additional forces to Travancore for a fixed annual payment.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|loc=Chapter I|p=109}} T.

While Ananthapadmanabhan was away, the prince was chased away by the men of Padmanabhan Thambi and an attempt on his life was made at Kalliyankattu temple. The incident is further referred as the escape of Marthanda Varma as a Brahmin. Dr. P. Venugopalan cites the references of the incident in the history of Travancore and ''Marthandamahathmyam'' [[Kilippattu]].{{sfnp|''Vy\u0101khy\u0101naku\u1e5fippuka\u1e37''|2009|p=402}} The incident took place at a temple of [[Shiva]] near to [[Kumarakovil]] (2 miles north to [[Thuckalay|Thakkala]]), where Marthanda Varma took shelter while evading the attackers. At the temple Marthanda Varma was aided by the temple priest to escape in the outfit of the latter, and the priest was killed by the attackers as he was in the outfit of the former.{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=26{{ndash}}27|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}}\n\nThere are references in the novel about attempts on the life of Marthanda Varma by his enemies as his successful escapes through the groove at Panathara, the [[Ezhava]] house at Perunkadavila, and the [[Nedumangad]] fort.\n\n=====Escape at an Ezhava house=====\nAccording to the legends, after evading the Ettuveettil Pillas and their men at Dhanuvachapuram,{{refn|name=Dhanuvacharef1|group=upper-alpha|Dhanuvachapuram is a village in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} Eithukondamkani,{{refn|name=Eithukondref1|group=upper-alpha|Eithukondamkani is a locality in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} and Marayamuttom,{{refn|name=Marayamref1|group=upper-alpha|Marayamuttom is a village in [[Neyyattinkara taluk]] of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} when Marthanda Varma was refreshing himself at a river near to Malakulangara{{refn|name=Malakularef1|group=upper-alpha|Malakulangara is a locality in Perumkadavila taluk of Thiruvananthapuram district.}} he was spotted by the men of Thambi brothers and in urgency to escape from them, he headed into a nearby Ezhava house, Alayil Puthur Veedu at Perumkadavila, where he was aided by the Kalipanikkathi (Lady Kali) to hide under the rattan enclosures. The men of Thambi brothers were unsuccessful in finding the prince.{{sfnp|Naduvattom Gopalakrishnan|2008|loc=\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d30\u0d41\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d1f\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d33 \u0d08\u0d34\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d3f [Ezhava house at Perunkadavila]|pp=61{{ndash}}62}}\n\n=====Aid by a Channan and Hiding inside a tree=====\nIn the novel, while running away from Velu Kuruppu and his men, Marthanda Varma is helped by a mad Channan who hides him in a tree and misdirects his pursuers. According to Dr. P. Venugopalan, the above account of actions is a collaboration of two situations where Marthanda Varma escaped from the enemies.{{sfnp|''Vy\u0101khy\u0101naku\u1e5fippuka\u1e37''|2009|p=402}} Once, when Marthanda Varma was returning after some confidential visits to [[Kanyakumari]] and [[Suchindram]], he was tracked by the men of Ettuveettil Pillas and Thambi brothers. While running away from the chasers, he was suggested by a Channan plougher of the nearby field to hide inside the hollow statue of the elephant at the adjacent temple of [[Ayyappan|Shasthavu]]. When the chasers reached the cultivation field and questioned the plougher, he misdirected them to the southern provinces. In another occasion, when Marthanda Varma was chased by the enemies, he evaded them by hiding inside the big hole within a jack tree at the [[Neyyattinkara Sree Krishna Swami Temple]].{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=26{{ndash}}27|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}} The tree is still preserved at the temple compound and known as Ammaccipl\u0101v\u016d (Mother jack tree).\n\n====Lethal attempt on Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma====\nThe incident is referred as the attempt to murder the little prince, Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma and his mother by Ramanamadathil Pilla along with his men in Kollavarsham 903, while the mother-son duo were heading from Trivandrum to Attingal, but only to evade the attempt with the help of Kilimanoor Koithampuran (Lord of Kilimanoor), who led the duo to a nearby safe village and took their place in the palanquin en route, confronted the attackers and eventually got killed, as described in the ''History of Travancore from the Earliest Times'' by P. Shangoony Menon.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|loc=Chapter I|pp=106, 108, 110}} The above account of incident is in conflict with the version described by [[Vaikkath Pachu Moothathu|Pachumuthathu]] in the ''Tiruvit\u0101\u1e41k\u016b\u1e5f Caritra\u1e41'',{{refn|name=Pachurefn1|group=upper-alpha|First published history of Travancore (in Malayalam) written by Pachu Moothathu in 1867.}} which recounts the same at Budhanoor{{refn|name=Budharef1|group=upper-alpha|Budhanoor is a village in Chengannur taluk of [[Alappuzha district]].}} in the then district of [[Chengannur]], where ruffians from [[Kayamkulam]] did the attack and states that lord of Kilimanoor who defended the attackers was the husband of the Queen. V. Nagam Aiya states the incident inline with the version by P. Shangoony Menon and mentions that lord of Kilimanoor, Kerala Varma Koithampuran as the consort of the Queen.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|loc=Chapter VI|pp=328{{ndash}}330}} T. K. Velu Pillai supports the version of Pachumuthathu and condemns the version by P. Shangoony Menon; which is cited by Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju, who points out the deliberation of T. K. Velu Pillai in supporting the version of Pachumuthathu by purposefully avoiding the references of incident in the British records, ''Letters to Tellicherry''{{refn|name=Telliref1|group=upper-alpha|''Letters to Tellicherry'' are records of [[Madras Presidency]] published as one of the series among ''Records of Fort St. George'' in 12 Volumes by the Superintendent of Government Press, Madras in 1934.}}.{{sfnmp|Velu Pillai|1940|loc=Modern History|1pp=232, 256{{ndash}}261|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|2pp=20{{ndash}}22}}\n\n====Heirship claim by Thambi brothers====\nDr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju refers to the legend that Thambi brothers made a claim to the throne of Venad during the final period of king Rama Varma as they were the linear descendants, which was against the tradition of collateral descent through maternal nephew followed by the Venad kingdom in selecting the heir to the throne.{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=28{{ndash}}29|loc=\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d7c\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d21\u0d35\u0d7c\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d41\u0d1f\u0d46 \u0d06\u0d26\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d32 \u0d1c\u0d40\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d02 [Early life of Marthanda Varma]}} P. K. Parameswaran Nair claims that there is a legend in which Rama Varma promises to his spouse, Abhirama to let the children she will bear, to ascend to the throne of Venad; however Dr. P. Venugopalan states that the above account of legend is not valid as Rama Varma was neither the king nor the next heir to the throne during the early days of his relationship with his spouse and he ruled the kingdom only in the last five years of his life.{{sfnmp|''C. V. Raman Pilla''|1959|1p=131|''M\u0101\u1e5ftt\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u1e5fmma: Sr\u0325\u1e63\u1e6diyu\u1e41 svar\u016bpavu\u1e41''|2009|2p=87}} P. Shangoony Menon and V. Nagam Aiya state that Thambi brothers were persuaded by feudatory chiefs and nobles, Ettuveettil Pillas and Madambies to make the claim to the throne.{{sfnmp|Shangoony Menon|1879|1pp=116{{ndash}}117|Nagam Aiya|1906|2pp=327, 333{{ndash}}335}} Dewan Nanoo Pillay states that Thambi duo manifested the claim, as they felt degraded from the royal rank after the accession of Marthanda Varma, so Madambies and Ettuveettil Pillas fomented their disaffection.{{sfnp|Nanoo Pillay|1886|pp=126{{ndash}}129}} T. K. Velu Pillai states that Thambi brothers attempted to seize the throne for themselves against the custom of Marumakkatt\u0101ya\u1e41 ([[Collateral descendant|collateral descent through maternal nephews]]).{{sfnp|Velu Pillai|1940|loc=Modern History|pp=271{{ndash}}273}} Even though the above claim and dispute happened after the demise of Rama Varma, in the novel, it is presented that the conspiracy by Thambi brothers were started long before the king was ill and also shows that Padmanabhan Thambi and Sundarayyan lay the plans against Marthanda Varma, to get him deprived from the line of succession. In the novel, it is mentioned that Ettuveettil Pillas gave assurance to Padmanabhan Thambi that they will make him king after the period of king Rama Varma. In the novel, it is also referred that Padmanabhan Thambi did not want to emphasize on Makkatt\u0101ya\u1e41 ([[Lineal descendant|lineal descent through sons]]) by raising the concern to Sundarayyan that such a succession may bring his younger brother Raman Thambi against him.\n\n====Treaty of Thambi brothers with foreign forces====\nThe heirship claim of the Thambi brothers against the then existing custom in Venad led them to seek the aid of foreign forces to confront Marthanda Varma. According to P. Shangoony Menon the elder Thambi brother, Papu Thamby went to Tiruchirapalli in Kollavarsham 905 (1730) to seek aid from [[Pandyan]] governor.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|loc=Chapter II|pp=116{{ndash}}117}} V. Nagam Aiya states that the Thambi brothers went together to Tiruchirapalli in 1729 to seek aid from Pandyan governor.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|loc=Chapter VI|pp=327, 333{{ndash}}335}} According to Dewan Nanoo Pillai, only one of the Thambi brothers proceeded to Tiruchirapalli in Kollavarsham 905 (1729-1730).{{sfnp|Nanoo Pillay|1886|pp=126{{ndash}}129}} T. K. Velu Pillai mentions that the Thambi brothers secured the mercenary services of a foreign contingent in Kollavarsham 905.{{sfnp|Velu Pillai|1940|loc=Modern History|pp=271{{ndash}}273}} In the novel, the younger brother, Raman Thambi goes to Nanjinadu to arrange for additional forces in Kollavarsham 903.\n\n====Council of Ettuveettil Pillas====\nEttuveettil Pillas formed a council at the convention area of an inn at [[Venganoor]], where they held consultation about the plans against the king Marthanda Varma and, the members resolved to assassinate the king on the [[Aaraattu]] festival day during his procession. The decision was scripted as palm leaf notes and hidden in the footwears of messengers.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|pp=120{{ndash}}121}} According to P. Shangoony Menon and V. Nagam Aiya, the conference happened sometime after Kollavarsham 906.{{sfnp|Nagam Aiya|1906|pp=336{{ndash}}339}} Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju states that above event as happened in Kollavarsham 912.{{sfnp|Ibrahim Kunju|1990|pp=31{{ndash}}32}} The messengers with the council notes were later detained by the king's men following the lead by a Pa\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101ra\u1e41 (keeper of the inn), who spied on the council members and eventually the plan was foiled.{{sfnp|Shangoony Menon|1879|pp=120{{ndash}}121}} In the novel, the council of Ettuveettil Pillas is convened at the maternal house of Kudamon Pilla near to Andiyirakkam.
