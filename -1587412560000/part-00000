Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol.

But the adorers of this sign do not consider, as do we, that it is a representation of the devil; on the contrary, for them it is that of the god Pan, the god of our modern schools of philosophy, the god of the Alexandrian theurgic school and of our own mystical Neoplatonists, the god of Lamartine and Victor Cousin, the god of Spinoza and Plato, the god of the primitive Gnostic schools; the Christ also of the dissident priesthood.... The mysteries of the Sabbath have been variously described, but they figure always in grimoires and in magical trials; the revelations made on the subject may be classified under three heads\u20141. those referring to a fantastic and imaginary Sabbath; 2. those which betray the secrets of the occult assemblies of veritable adepts; 3. revelations of foolish and criminal gatherings, having for their object the operations of black magic.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[socialism]], or [[Utopian socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. L\u00e9vi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity.

Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in ''[[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: \"And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mysteries, in His name BAPHOMET.\"<ref>{{Cite web| author = Helena|author2=Tau Apiryon| title = The Invisible Basilica: The Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church: An Examination| accessdate = 2009-08-09| url = http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/creed_egc.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', Crowley asserted that Baphomet was a divine androgyne and \"the hieroglyph of arcane perfection\": seen as that which reflects. \"What occurs above so reflects below, or As above so below,\"\n{{quote|The Devil does not exist.

Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word \u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].''

Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order. This view was also taken by a succession of German scholars, in England by C. G. Addison, and in France by a whole series of conspicuous writers: ''e.g.'' Mignet, Guizot, Renan, Lavocat. Others, like Boutaric, while rejecting the charge of heresy, accepted the evidence for the ''spuitio'' and the indecent kisses, explaining the former as a formula of forgotten meaning and the latter as a sign of ''fraternit\u00e9!''{{-\"}} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911.</ref>\n\nSince 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with the \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by [[\u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi]],<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/><ref name=Waite/> which contains binary elements representing the \"[[Symbol|symbolization]] of the equilibrium of opposites\"<ref name=Strube/> (e.g. [[Human\u2013animal hybrid|half-human and half-animal]], [[Androgyny|male and female]], [[good and evil]], on and off, etc.).<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> On one hand, L\u00e9vi's intention was to symbolize his concept of balance that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light;<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a tradition that should result in a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/>\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Baphomet'' appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the [[Crusades|crusader]] Anselm of Ribemont:\n{|\n|\n{{quote|''Sequenti die aurora apparente, altis vocibus '''Baphometh''' invocaverunt; et nos Deum nostrum in cordibus nostris deprecantes, impetum facientes in eos, de muris civitatis omnes expulimus.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cIUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT142 |title=Godefridi Bullonii epistolae et diplomata; accedunt appendices |first=Godfrey |last=Bullonii (of Bouillon) |date=30 March 2018 |via=Google Books}}</ref>}}\n|\n{{quote|As the next day dawned, they called loudly upon '''Baphometh'''; and we prayed silently in our hearts to God, then we attacked and forced all of them outside the city walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|Bate|2010|p=29}}</ref>}}\n|}\n[[Raymond of Aguilers]], a chronicler of the [[First Crusade]], reports that the [[troubadour]]s used the term ''Bafomet'' for the [[Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and called the [[mosque]]s ''Bafumarias''.<ref>\"Raimundus de Agiles says of the Mahometans: In ecclesiis autem magnis '''Bafumarias''' faciebant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. habebant monticulum ubi du\u00e6 erant '''Bafumari\u00e6'''.

[[British Library]], London.]]\n\nWhen the medieval order of the Knights Templar was suppressed by King [[Philip IV of France]], on Friday 13&nbsp;October 1307, Philip had many French Templars simultaneously arrested, and then tortured into confessions. Over 100&nbsp;different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], [[Homosexuality in medieval Europe|homosexual relations]], spitting and urinating on the cross, and [[sodomy]].<ref name=Stahuljak2/> Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the [[Catharism|Cathars]]<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=204}}</ref> and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and charged him with near identical offenses. Yet [[Malcolm Barber]] observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\".<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=306}}</ref> The \"[[Chinon Parchment]] suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross,\" says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the [[Saracen]]s, where they were taught how to commit [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] \"with the mind only and not with the heart\".<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|2005|p=138}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Haag<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Haag |title=Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's temple to the Freemasons |publisher=Profile Books |year=2009}}</ref> suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation ritual.\n\n{{quote| The indictment (acte d'accusation) published by the court of Rome set forth ... \"that in all the provinces they had idols, that is to say, heads, some of which had three faces, others but one; sometimes, it was a human skull ...

Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity.

Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word \u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series. The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the History of the Knights Templar.\n\nIn the popular [[Personal Computer|PC]] video game ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', in the final mission \"Icon of Sin\", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.\n\nIn July 2015 YouTube star and singer [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]] depicted the deity in the music video for her single \"Lowlife\". Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.\n\nThe 2018 [[Netflix]] series [[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'']] has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. [[The Satanic Temple]] has accused the show of plagiarizing [[Statue of Baphomet|their depiction]] of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2018/11/01/the-satanic-temple-netflixs-sabrina-remake-plagiarized-our-baphomet-statue/|title=The Satanic Temple: Netflix's 'Sabrina' Remake Plagiarized Our Baphomet Statue|last=Atheist|first=Friendly|work=Friendly Atheist|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', in the final mission \"Final Sin\", the Icon of Sin has a resemblance to early depictions of Baphomet.\n\nIannis Stamatakos has pointed out that the name Baphomet, when interpreted through the universal transliteration of the letters with the Greek, is a basic atbash crypt which splits the word in the middle and places the last part to the beginning of the word spelling the word \"Metapho(R)\", with the letter B inserted to add complexity.

At these times the Israelis were advancing towards Suez City with a combined Armor-Infantry force. Tye Egyptian Army HC decided to send the 75th Parachute Battalion to save the city. the Battalion landed at the outskirts of the city at the time when Israeli tanks and troops were advancing towards the city.

The Blue Jays defeated the Phillies, four games to two. With Toronto ahead three games to two in the Series, but trailing Game 6 by a score of 6\u20135 in the bottom of the ninth [[inning]], [[Joe Carter]] hit a [[Walk-off home run|game-winning]] three-run [[home run]] to clinch Toronto's second consecutive championship (the first team to repeat as champions since the [[1977 New York Yankees season|1977]]\u2013[[1978 New York Yankees season|78 Yankees]]). This was only the second Series concluded by such a home run (the first was in the [[1960 World Series]] on a [[Bill Mazeroski]] home run for the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]), and the first such occasion where a come-from-behind walk-off home run won a World Series.

The result was less than a pitcher's duel, however, as both teams scored early and often. The Philles struck first in the top of the first on RBI singles by [[John Kruk]] and [[Darren Daulton]] aided by two walks. In the bottom of the second, after two singles and a wild pitch, [[Paul Molitor]]'s single and [[Tony Fernandez]]'s groundout scored a run each to tie the game. The Phillies took a 3\u20132 lead in the third when [[Mariano Duncan]] hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Kruk's single, but the Blue Jays tied the game in the bottom half when [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] reached third on left fielder's [[Milt Thompson]]'s error and scored on [[Joe Carter]]'s sacrifice fly. The Phillies retook the lead in the fifth inning when Duncan tripled with one out and scored on a wild pitch, but White hit a home run to tie the game in the bottom of the inning. The next inning, [[John Olerud]] hit a home run of his own to put Toronto on top 5\u20134. In the seventh, after two one-out singles, Schilling was relieved by [[David West (baseball)|David West]], who allowed an RBI double to White and two-run double to [[Roberto Alomar]] to pad Toronto's lead to 8\u20134. The Phillies got a run in the ninth when Kruk hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s two-out single, but [[Duane Ward]] got [[Ricky Jordan]] to fly out to end the game as Toronto won 8\u20135. [[Al Leiter]] pitched {{frac|2|2|3}} innings\u2014in relief of an erratic [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzman]], who walked four in just five innings\u2014for his first World Series win.

Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead: in the third inning, After two walks, [[John Kruk]] and [[Dave Hollins]] hit back-to-back RBI singles, then [[Jim Eisenreich]] followed with a three-run home run to deep right-center to put them up 5\u20130. Toronto got on the scoreboard in the fourth inning courtesy of a [[Joe Carter]] two-run home run to left, then cut the Phillies' lead to 5\u20133 in the sixth when [[Roberto Alomar]] singled with two outs and scored on [[Tony Fernandez]]'s double, but the Phillies got that run back in the seventh on [[Lenny Dykstra]]'s home run off of [[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]]. Toronto cut the lead to 6\u20134 in the eighth when [[Paul Molitor]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Roger Mason (baseball)|Roger Mason]], stole third and scored on [[John Olerud]]'s sacrifice fly off of [[Mitch Williams]]. Alomar then walked and stole second, but was caught stealing third to end the inning. Williams then pitched a scoreless ninth as the Phillies won to tie the series. Mulholland pitched {{frac|5|2|3}} innings, allowing three earned runs, for the win.\n\n===Game 3===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Tuesday, October 19, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=[[Veterans Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]\n|Road='''Toronto'''|RoadAbr=TOR\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=1|R4=0|R5=0|R6=1|R7=3|R8=0|R9=2|RR=10|RH=13|RE=1\n|Home=Philadelphia|HomeAbr=PHI\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=1|H8=0|H9=1|HR=3|HH=9|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Pat Hentgen]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Danny Jackson]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Paul Molitor]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Milt Thompson (baseball)|Milt Thompson]] (1)\n|}}\n\nFor Toronto, [[Pat Hentgen]] faced off against Philadelphia starter [[Danny Jackson]], who had pitched in the 1985 and 1990 World Series, in Game 3. Hentgen pitched a strong six innings, allowing just a single run, and the Toronto offense took care of the rest. In Jackson's previous postseason start against the Blue Jays, he had recorded a shutout (in the [[1985 American League Championship Series]]), but he was not nearly as effective in this game. After a leadoff single and walk in the first, [[Paul Molitor]]'s two-run triple and [[Joe Carter]]'s sacrifice fly put Toronto up 3\u20130. Molitor's two-out home run in the third made it 4\u20130 Blue Jays, who then loaded the bases on three straight singles, but Jackson struck out [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]] to end the inning without further damage. In the sixth, [[Roberto Alomar]] hit a leadoff single off of [[Ben Rivera]], stole second and third and scored on [[Tony Fernandez]]'s sacrifice fly. The Phillies got on the board in the bottom of the inning on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s RBI single with two on via two walks. In the top of the seventh, [[Rickey Henderson]] hit a leadoff double, then scored on [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]'s triple. After a walk and strikeout, Alomar's RBI single made it 7\u20131 Toronto. [[Bobby Thigpen]] relieved Rivera and walked Fernandez before Sprague's sacrifice fly made it 8\u20131 Blue Jays. Three straight one-out singles by [[Milt Thompson]], [[Lenny Dykstra]] and [[Mariano Duncan]] off of [[Danny Cox (baseball)|Danny Cox]] in the bottom of the inning made it 8\u20132 Blue Jays.  Molitor hit a leadoff single in the ninth off of [[Larry Andersen]] before Alomar's triple and Fernandez's single scored a run each to make it 10\u20132 Blue Jays. [[Duane Ward]] allowed a leadoff home run in the bottom of the inning to Thompson before retiring the next three hitters to end the game and give the Blue Jays a 2\u20131 series lead.\n\nToronto manager [[Cito Gaston]] was once again faced with an unusual and difficult decision prior to game time. As the Series switched to the [[National League]] ballpark, Gaston could not use his [[designated hitter]], [[Paul Molitor]], unless he played him in the field. This was not unfamiliar to Gaston, as he had to do the same thing [[1992 World Series|one year prior]] to keep [[Dave Winfield]] in his lineup. Molitor's hitting kept him in the lineup over [[John Olerud]] for the games in Philadelphia, where he would play first base. The decision was potentially controversial as Olerud had led the [[American League]] in batting over the season with a .363 average; moreover, Molitor was the less sure-handed fielder. Molitor, however, put these concerns to rest, going 3-for-4, hitting a home run in the third inning and driving in three runs, while playing adequately at first base.\n\n===Game 4===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Wednesday, October 20, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Road='''Toronto'''|RoadAbr=TOR\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=4|R4=0|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=6|R9=0|RR=15|RH=18|RE=0\n|Home=Philadelphia|HomeAbr=PHI\n|H1=4|H2=2|H3=0|H4=1|H5=5|H6=1|H7=1|H8=0|H9=0|HR=14|HH=14|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Duane Ward]] (2)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Lenny Dykstra]] 2 (3), [[Darren Daulton]] (1)\n|}}\n\nIn the fourth game of the Series, Toronto sent [[Todd Stottlemyre]] to the mound while Philadelphia countered with [[Tommy Greene]].  It had been a rainy day in Philadelphia, which water-logged the aging turf at Veterans Stadium, making for particularly slippery conditions.\n\nToronto loaded the bases in the first on double, walk and single. [[Paul Molitor]] walked to force in a run before [[Tony Fernandez]]'s single scored two more. In the bottom half, three walks loaded the bases for the Phillies before [[Jim Eisenreich]] walked to force in a run, then [[Milt Thompson]]'s three-run triple put the Phillies up 4\u20133. [[Lenny Dykstra]]'s two-run home run next inning made it 6\u20133 Phillies. In the top of the third, after a one-out walk and single, consecutive RBI singles by [[Tony Fernandez]] and [[Pat Borders]] cut the lead to 6\u20135. [[Roger Mason (baseball)|Roger Mason]] relieved Greene and after a groundout and walk, [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]'s two-run single put Toronto up 7\u20136, but the Phillies tied the game in the fourth when Dykstra doubled with two outs off of [[Al Leiter]] and scored on [[Mariano Duncan]]'s single. Next inning, after a leadoff single, [[Darren Daulton]]'s two-run home run put the Phillies up 9\u20137. After another single, Thompson's RBI double made it 10\u20137, then Dykstra's second home run of the game made it 12\u20137 Phillies.\n\nIn the sixth, White hit a leadoff double before scoring on [[Roberto Alomar]]'s single off of [[David West (baseball)|David West]]. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Fernandez's RBI groundout cut the Phillies' lead to 12\u20139, but they added a run in the bottom half when [[Dave Hollins]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]] and scored on Thompson's two-out single. Next inning, a hit-by-pitch to Dalton with the bases loaded made it 14\u20139 Phillies. In the eighth, though, after a one-out single and walk off of [[Larry Andersen]], Molitor's RBI double made it 14\u201310 Phillies. Fernandez then hit an RBI single off of [[Mitch Williams]]. A walk loaded the bases, then after a strikeout, [[Rickey Henderson]]'s single and White's triple scored two runs each to put Toronto ahead 15\u201314. [[Duane Ward]] earned the save, retiring the last four Phillies batters.\n\nThree new World Series records were set, including the longest game (4:14), most total runs scored in a single game (29), and most runs scored by a losing team (14). Also, [[Charlie Williams (umpire)|Charlie Williams]] became the first [[African American]] to serve as the home plate umpire for a World Series game.\n\nTwo [[death threat]]s directed towards Mitch Williams were phoned into Veterans Stadium as soon as it became evident that Williams was going to be the losing pitcher of Game 4. Williams was not aware of the death threats until after Game 5.\n\n===Game 5===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Thursday, October 21, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Road=Toronto|RoadAbr=TOR\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=5|RE=1\n|Home='''Philadelphia'''|HomeAbr=PHI\n|H1=1|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=2|HH=5|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Curt Schilling]] (1\u20131)|LP=[[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzm\u00e1n]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe offenses were due for an off-day, and it came in Game 5 courtesy of a [[Curt Schilling]] (Philadelphia) and [[Juan Guzman (pitcher)|Juan Guzman]] (Toronto) pitching duel. Schilling shut down the previously unstoppable Toronto offense, limiting the team to just five hits, no extra-base hits (although catcher [[Pat Borders]] had two hits) and no runs in a complete-game shutout. It was only the second time all season that Toronto had been shut out. Guzman pitched well in a losing effort, allowing only two runs and five hits in seven innings of work.\n\nThe two runs scored as a result of scrappy baserunning play from the Philadelphia offense. In the first inning, [[Lenny Dykstra]] walked, stole second, moved to third on a [[Pat Borders]] throwing error, and scored on a [[John Kruk]] ground out. In the second inning, [[Darren Daulton]] opened with a double, took third on a ground out, and scored on a [[Kevin Stocker]] single.\n\nAs it turned out, it was the final postseason baseball game in [[Veterans Stadium]]. It was demolished after the [[2003 Philadelphia Phillies season|2003 season]].\n\n===Game 6===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Saturday, October 23, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario\n|Road=Philadelphia|RoadAbr=PHI\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=5|R8=0|R9=0|RR=6|RH=7|RE=0\n|Home='''Toronto'''|HomeAbr=TOR\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=1|H5=1|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=3|HR=8|HH=10|HE=2\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Duane Ward]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] (0\u20132)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Lenny Dykstra]] (4)|HomeHR=[[Paul Molitor]] (2), [[Joe Carter]] (2)\n|}}\n\nThe sixth game in the Series was a rematch between Game 2 starters [[Terry Mulholland]] and [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]], who would have similar results. Toronto scored in the bottom of the first with a run-scoring [[Paul Molitor]] triple after a walk, [[Joe Carter]] sacrifice fly to score Molitor, and [[Roberto Alomar]] RBI single after a double. The Phillies got on the board in the fourth when [[Darren Daulton]] doubled with two outs and scored on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s single, but the Blue Jays got that run back in the bottom of the inning on when Alomar hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]]'s sacrifice fly. [[Paul Molitor]] added a home run in the fifth inning while the Toronto fans were chanting \"MVP\" for Paul, bringing the score to 5\u20131 for Toronto. Molitor became the first player in World Series history to have at least two home runs, two doubles, and two triples.\n\nIn the seventh inning, Philadelphia fought back with five runs. After a walk and single, [[Lenny Dykstra]] hit a three-run home run to knock Stewart out of the game. [[Mariano Duncan]] singled off reliever [[Danny Cox (baseball)|Danny Cox]], stole second, and scored on [[Dave Hollins]]'s RBI single to tie the game. A walk and single loaded the bases before [[Pete Incaviglia]] hit a sacrifice fly to put the Phillies up 6\u20135.\n\nThe Blue Jays would try to threaten in the bottom of the eighth.  [[John Olerud]] would draw a one-out walk and the Phillies would bring in [[Larry Andersen]] to face [[Roberto Alomar]].  After Alomar grounded out, Andersen would then hit [[Tony Fernandez]] with a pitch and walk [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]] to load the bases.  Andersen would then get out of the inning by inducing a pop-fly to [[Pat Borders]].  This would become significant in the next inning, with the batting order reset to the top with [[Rickey Henderson]] leading off.\n\nPhiladelphia closer [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] came on to pitch the bottom of the ninth with his team clinging to a 6\u20135 lead. After beginning the inning by walking [[Rickey Henderson]], Williams tried to counter Henderson's speed by using a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to the game, Williams had never used the slide-step delivery in his career, and this may have cut back on his velocity. The walk to Henderson was followed by a [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] fly out and a single by [[Paul Molitor]] that moved Henderson to second.\n\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|thumb|260px|Fireworks in the SkyDome after Carter's home run.]]\n[[Joe Carter]] came up next and, with the count 2\u20132, he hit a three-run home run to win the game and the World Series. Just before the fifth and final pitch to Joe Carter, [[CBS Sports]] announcer [[Tim McCarver]] commented that Carter (relatively unproductive in the Series to date) looked awkward and uncomfortable at the plate. The same pitch allowed Blue Jays radio announcer [[Tom Cheek]] the opportunity to utter his famous \"Touch 'em all, Joe\" quote, when Joe Carter clinched the series. Carter joined [[Bill Mazeroski]] as one of the only two players to win a World Series with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nCarter was actively involved in the final play of the World Series for the second year in a row. In the [[1992 World Series|previous year]], Carter caught the final out as first baseman after relief pitcher [[Mike Timlin]] fielded [[Otis Nixon]]'s bunt. Taking the 1993 ALCS into account (where he caught the final out in the outfield), he had been involved in the final play of three straight postseason series.\n\nAmerican League president [[Bobby Brown (third baseman)|Dr. Bobby Brown]] presented the [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|World Series Trophy]] instead of the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]]; this event also occurred in [[1992 World Series|the year before]].\n\n==Composite box==\n1993 World Series '''(4\u20132): [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (A.L.)''' over [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (N.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[Toronto Blue Jays]]'''\n|R1=9|R2=2|R3=6|R4=3|R5=2|R6=5|R7=6|R8=7|R9=5|RR=45|RH=64|RE=7\n|Home='''[[Philadelphia Phillies]]'''\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=6|H4=2|H5=6|H6=2|H7=8|H8=0|H9=2|HR=36|HH=58|HE=2\n|TotalAttendance=344,394 |AveAttendance=57,399\n|WinPlayerShare=$127,921 |LosePlayerShare=$91,222<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archivedate= May 2, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Blue Jays became the second expansion team to win two World Series championships, following the [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in {{wsy|1986}}.

[[Sean McDonough]] (play-by-play) and [[Tim McCarver]] (color commentary and himself a former [[List of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters|Phillies broadcaster]]) called the action for CBS. The following season, Major League Baseball entered into a revenue sharing [[joint venture]] with [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] called [[The Baseball Network]], but that joint venture was cancelled after two seasons, and by 1996, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] took over the broadcasting rights to MLB games. CBS' [[Andrea Joyce]] became the first woman to co-host (alongside [[Pat O'Brien (radio and television personality)|Pat O'Brien]]) a World Series. Serving as field reporters for CBS were [[Lesley Visser]] (in the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]]' dugout) and [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] (in the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]]' dugout)\n\nThe national radio broadcast was also provided by [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS]], with [[Vin Scully]] and [[Johnny Bench]] on the call. Locally, the Series was called on [[WPHT|WOGL-AM]] in Philadelphia by [[Harry Kalas]], [[Richie Ashburn]], [[Chris Wheeler]], [[Andy Musser]], and [[Garry Maddox]] and on [[CJCL (AM)|CJCL-AM]] in Toronto by [[Jerry Howarth]] and [[Tom Cheek]]. Cheek's famous call of the Carter home run (\"Touch 'em all Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\") lives on in Blue Jays folklore.\n\nThe 1993 series was Richie Ashburn's last as a Phillies broadcaster, as he died in [[1997 Philadelphia Phillies season|1997]]. Andy Musser also called his last World Series as a member of the Phillies' broadcast team; he retired in [[2001 Philadelphia Phillies season|2001]] and died eleven years later. Tom Cheek never called another postseason game in his role as voice of the Blue Jays, from which he retired in [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] prior to his death from [[brain cancer]]. Game 6 also marked Johnny Bench's final broadcast for CBS Radio after nine years (he would be replaced on CBS Radio's World Series broadcasts by [[Jeff Torborg]]), while Harry Kalas would not call another World Series until 2008. Kalas later died in [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] prior to a game at [[Nationals Park]] in Washington, D.C.. Chris Wheeler continued to call games for the Phillies until being released in 2014 and Jerry Howarth continued to call Blue Jays games, moving into the primary play-by-play position following the death of Cheek, until his retirement before the [[2018 Toronto Blue Jays season|2018 season]]. Howarth would return to call postseason games when the Blue Jays qualified in [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|2015]] and [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016]], where they were eliminated in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] both years.\n\n===The Joe Carter home run calls===\n*[[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]], with [[Vin Scully]]:\n\n::''Fastball is hit to left field, down the line, in the corner, home run! Joe Carter who took the 2 and 0 pitch for a strike right down the middle hits the 2 and 1 (sic) pitch over the left field wall and the Toronto Blue Jays come back with 3 in the bottom of the ninth inning to become the World Champions yet again. The final score: Toronto 8, Philadelphia 6.''\n\n*[[CJCL (AM)|CJCL-AM Radio]] in [[List of Toronto Blue Jays broadcasters|Toronto]] by [[Tom Cheek]]:\n\n::''Joe has had his moments. Trying to lay off that ball, low to the outside part of the plate, he just went after one. Two balls and two strikes on him. Here's the pitch on the way. A swing and a belt! Left field, way back, BLUE JAYS WIN IT! The Blue Jays are World Series Champions, as Joe Carter hits a three-run home run in the ninth inning and the Blue Jays have repeated as World Series Champions! Touch 'em all, Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!''\n\n*[[WPHT|WOGL-AM Radio]] in [[List of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters|Philadelphia]] by [[Harry Kalas]]:\n\n::''The 2\u20132 pitch, line drive in deep left, this ball is outta here. Three-run home run, Joe Carter, and the Toronto Blue Jays are the world champions of baseball for the second straight year. A three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth by Joe Carter who's being mobbed at home plate.''\n\n*[[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS Television]]. [[Sean McDonough]]:\n\n::''Now the 2-2. Well-hit down the left-field line! Way back and GONE! Joe Carter with a three-run homer! The winners and still world champions, the Toronto Blue Jays!''\n\n==Music==\n95 South Remixed their local hit \"Whoot There It Is\" turning into a special tribute to the Phillies. It is often confused with \"Whoomp There It Is\" by Tag Team; however, the songs are distinctly different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nToronto rapper [[Choclair]] refers to Joe Carter's walk-off home run in his 1999 song, \"[[Let's Ride (Choclair song)|Let's Ride]]\".\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Toronto rapper [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] released a [[Diss (music)|diss track]] against Philadelphia rapper [[Meek Mill]] entitled \"[[Back to Back (Drake song)|Back to Back]]\".

The Blue Jays defeated the Phillies, four games to two. With Toronto ahead three games to two in the Series, but trailing Game 6 by a score of 6\u20135 in the bottom of the ninth [[inning]], [[Joe Carter]] hit a [[Walk-off home run|game-winning]] three-run [[home run]] to clinch Toronto's second consecutive championship (the first team to repeat as champions since the [[1977 New York Yankees season|1977]]\u2013[[1978 New York Yankees season|78 Yankees]]). This was only the second Series concluded by such a home run (the first was in the [[1960 World Series]] on a [[Bill Mazeroski]] home run for the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]), and the first such occasion where a come-from-behind walk-off home run won a World Series.

The result was less than a pitcher's duel, however, as both teams scored early and often. The Philles struck first in the top of the first on RBI singles by [[John Kruk]] and [[Darren Daulton]] aided by two walks. In the bottom of the second, after two singles and a wild pitch, [[Paul Molitor]]'s single and [[Tony Fernandez]]'s groundout scored a run each to tie the game. The Phillies took a 3\u20132 lead in the third when [[Mariano Duncan]] hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Kruk's single, but the Blue Jays tied the game in the bottom half when [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] reached third on left fielder's [[Milt Thompson]]'s error and scored on [[Joe Carter]]'s sacrifice fly. The Phillies retook the lead in the fifth inning when Duncan tripled with one out and scored on a wild pitch, but White hit a home run to tie the game in the bottom of the inning. The next inning, [[John Olerud]] hit a home run of his own to put Toronto on top 5\u20134. In the seventh, after two one-out singles, Schilling was relieved by [[David West (baseball)|David West]], who allowed an RBI double to White and two-run double to [[Roberto Alomar]] to pad Toronto's lead to 8\u20134. The Phillies got a run in the ninth when Kruk hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s two-out single, but [[Duane Ward]] got [[Ricky Jordan]] to fly out to end the game as Toronto won 8\u20135. [[Al Leiter]] pitched {{frac|2|2|3}} innings\u2014in relief of an erratic [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzman]], who walked four in just five innings\u2014for his first World Series win.

Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead: in the third inning, After two walks, [[John Kruk]] and [[Dave Hollins]] hit back-to-back RBI singles, then [[Jim Eisenreich]] followed with a three-run home run to deep right-center to put them up 5\u20130. Toronto got on the scoreboard in the fourth inning courtesy of a [[Joe Carter]] two-run home run to left, then cut the Phillies' lead to 5\u20133 in the sixth when [[Roberto Alomar]] singled with two outs and scored on [[Tony Fernandez]]'s double, but the Phillies got that run back in the seventh on [[Lenny Dykstra]]'s home run off of [[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]]. Toronto cut the lead to 6\u20134 in the eighth when [[Paul Molitor]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Roger Mason (baseball)|Roger Mason]], stole third and scored on [[John Olerud]]'s sacrifice fly off of [[Mitch Williams]]. Alomar then walked and stole second, but was caught stealing third to end the inning. Williams then pitched a scoreless ninth as the Phillies won to tie the series.

Hentgen pitched a strong six innings, allowing just a single run, and the Toronto offense took care of the rest. In Jackson's previous postseason start against the Blue Jays, he had recorded a shutout (in the [[1985 American League Championship Series]]), but he was not nearly as effective in this game. After a leadoff single and walk in the first, [[Paul Molitor]]'s two-run triple and [[Joe Carter]]'s sacrifice fly put Toronto up 3\u20130. Molitor's two-out home run in the third made it 4\u20130 Blue Jays, who then loaded the bases on three straight singles, but Jackson struck out [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]] to end the inning without further damage. In the sixth, [[Roberto Alomar]] hit a leadoff single off of [[Ben Rivera]], stole second and third and scored on [[Tony Fernandez]]'s sacrifice fly. The Phillies got on the board in the bottom of the inning on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s RBI single with two on via two walks. In the top of the seventh, [[Rickey Henderson]] hit a leadoff double, then scored on [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]'s triple. After a walk and strikeout, Alomar's RBI single made it 7\u20131 Toronto. [[Bobby Thigpen]] relieved Rivera and walked Fernandez before Sprague's sacrifice fly made it 8\u20131 Blue Jays. Three straight one-out singles by [[Milt Thompson]], [[Lenny Dykstra]] and [[Mariano Duncan]] off of [[Danny Cox (baseball)|Danny Cox]] in the bottom of the inning made it 8\u20132 Blue Jays.  Molitor hit a leadoff single in the ninth off of [[Larry Andersen]] before Alomar's triple and Fernandez's single scored a run each to make it 10\u20132 Blue Jays. [[Duane Ward]] allowed a leadoff home run in the bottom of the inning to Thompson before retiring the next three hitters to end the game and give the Blue Jays a 2\u20131 series lead.\n\nToronto manager [[Cito Gaston]] was once again faced with an unusual and difficult decision prior to game time. As the Series switched to the [[National League]] ballpark, Gaston could not use his [[designated hitter]], [[Paul Molitor]], unless he played him in the field. This was not unfamiliar to Gaston, as he had to do the same thing [[1992 World Series|one year prior]] to keep [[Dave Winfield]] in his lineup. Molitor's hitting kept him in the lineup over [[John Olerud]] for the games in Philadelphia, where he would play first base. The decision was potentially controversial as Olerud had led the [[American League]] in batting over the season with a .363 average; moreover, Molitor was the less sure-handed fielder. Molitor, however, put these concerns to rest, going 3-for-4, hitting a home run in the third inning and driving in three runs, while playing adequately at first base.\n\n===Game 4===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Wednesday, October 20, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Road='''Toronto'''|RoadAbr=TOR\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=4|R4=0|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=6|R9=0|RR=15|RH=18|RE=0\n|Home=Philadelphia|HomeAbr=PHI\n|H1=4|H2=2|H3=0|H4=1|H5=5|H6=1|H7=1|H8=0|H9=0|HR=14|HH=14|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Duane Ward]] (2)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Lenny Dykstra]] 2 (3), [[Darren Daulton]] (1)\n|}}\n\nIn the fourth game of the Series, Toronto sent [[Todd Stottlemyre]] to the mound while Philadelphia countered with [[Tommy Greene]].  It had been a rainy day in Philadelphia, which water-logged the aging turf at Veterans Stadium, making for particularly slippery conditions.\n\nToronto loaded the bases in the first on double, walk and single. [[Paul Molitor]] walked to force in a run before [[Tony Fernandez]]'s single scored two more. In the bottom half, three walks loaded the bases for the Phillies before [[Jim Eisenreich]] walked to force in a run, then [[Milt Thompson]]'s three-run triple put the Phillies up 4\u20133. [[Lenny Dykstra]]'s two-run home run next inning made it 6\u20133 Phillies. In the top of the third, after a one-out walk and single, consecutive RBI singles by [[Tony Fernandez]] and [[Pat Borders]] cut the lead to 6\u20135. [[Roger Mason (baseball)|Roger Mason]] relieved Greene and after a groundout and walk, [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]]'s two-run single put Toronto up 7\u20136, but the Phillies tied the game in the fourth when Dykstra doubled with two outs off of [[Al Leiter]] and scored on [[Mariano Duncan]]'s single. Next inning, after a leadoff single, [[Darren Daulton]]'s two-run home run put the Phillies up 9\u20137. After another single, Thompson's RBI double made it 10\u20137, then Dykstra's second home run of the game made it 12\u20137 Phillies.\n\nIn the sixth, White hit a leadoff double before scoring on [[Roberto Alomar]]'s single off of [[David West (baseball)|David West]]. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Fernandez's RBI groundout cut the Phillies' lead to 12\u20139, but they added a run in the bottom half when [[Dave Hollins]] hit a leadoff double off of [[Tony Castillo (pitcher)|Tony Castillo]] and scored on Thompson's two-out single. Next inning, a hit-by-pitch to Dalton with the bases loaded made it 14\u20139 Phillies. In the eighth, though, after a one-out single and walk off of [[Larry Andersen]], Molitor's RBI double made it 14\u201310 Phillies. Fernandez then hit an RBI single off of [[Mitch Williams]]. A walk loaded the bases, then after a strikeout, [[Rickey Henderson]]'s single and White's triple scored two runs each to put Toronto ahead 15\u201314. [[Duane Ward]] earned the save, retiring the last four Phillies batters.\n\nThree new World Series records were set, including the longest game (4:14), most total runs scored in a single game (29), and most runs scored by a losing team (14). Also, [[Charlie Williams (umpire)|Charlie Williams]] became the first [[African American]] to serve as the home plate umpire for a World Series game.\n\nTwo [[death threat]]s directed towards Mitch Williams were phoned into Veterans Stadium as soon as it became evident that Williams was going to be the losing pitcher of Game 4. Williams was not aware of the death threats until after Game 5.\n\n===Game 5===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Thursday, October 21, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Road=Toronto|RoadAbr=TOR\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=5|RE=1\n|Home='''Philadelphia'''|HomeAbr=PHI\n|H1=1|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=2|HH=5|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Curt Schilling]] (1\u20131)|LP=[[Juan Guzm\u00e1n (baseball)|Juan Guzm\u00e1n]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe offenses were due for an off-day, and it came in Game 5 courtesy of a [[Curt Schilling]] (Philadelphia) and [[Juan Guzman (pitcher)|Juan Guzman]] (Toronto) pitching duel. Schilling shut down the previously unstoppable Toronto offense, limiting the team to just five hits, no extra-base hits (although catcher [[Pat Borders]] had two hits) and no runs in a complete-game shutout. It was only the second time all season that Toronto had been shut out. Guzman pitched well in a losing effort, allowing only two runs and five hits in seven innings of work.\n\nThe two runs scored as a result of scrappy baserunning play from the Philadelphia offense. In the first inning, [[Lenny Dykstra]] walked, stole second, moved to third on a [[Pat Borders]] throwing error, and scored on a [[John Kruk]] ground out. In the second inning, [[Darren Daulton]] opened with a double, took third on a ground out, and scored on a [[Kevin Stocker]] single.\n\nAs it turned out, it was the final postseason baseball game in [[Veterans Stadium]]. It was demolished after the [[2003 Philadelphia Phillies season|2003 season]].\n\n===Game 6===\n{{Linescore|\n|Date=Saturday, October 23, 1993\n|Time=8:12{{nbsp}}pm (EDT)\n|Location=SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario\n|Road=Philadelphia|RoadAbr=PHI\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=5|R8=0|R9=0|RR=6|RH=7|RE=0\n|Home='''Toronto'''|HomeAbr=TOR\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=0|H4=1|H5=1|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=3|HR=8|HH=10|HE=2\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Duane Ward]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] (0\u20132)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Lenny Dykstra]] (4)|HomeHR=[[Paul Molitor]] (2), [[Joe Carter]] (2)\n|}}\n\nThe sixth game in the Series was a rematch between Game 2 starters [[Terry Mulholland]] and [[Dave Stewart (baseball)|Dave Stewart]], who would have similar results. Toronto scored in the bottom of the first with a run-scoring [[Paul Molitor]] triple after a walk, [[Joe Carter]] sacrifice fly to score Molitor, and [[Roberto Alomar]] RBI single after a double. The Phillies got on the board in the fourth when [[Darren Daulton]] doubled with two outs and scored on [[Jim Eisenreich]]'s single, but the Blue Jays got that run back in the bottom of the inning on when Alomar hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]]'s sacrifice fly. [[Paul Molitor]] added a home run in the fifth inning while the Toronto fans were chanting \"MVP\" for Paul, bringing the score to 5\u20131 for Toronto. Molitor became the first player in World Series history to have at least two home runs, two doubles, and two triples.\n\nIn the seventh inning, Philadelphia fought back with five runs. After a walk and single, [[Lenny Dykstra]] hit a three-run home run to knock Stewart out of the game. [[Mariano Duncan]] singled off reliever [[Danny Cox (baseball)|Danny Cox]], stole second, and scored on [[Dave Hollins]]'s RBI single to tie the game. A walk and single loaded the bases before [[Pete Incaviglia]] hit a sacrifice fly to put the Phillies up 6\u20135.\n\nThe Blue Jays would try to threaten in the bottom of the eighth.  [[John Olerud]] would draw a one-out walk and the Phillies would bring in [[Larry Andersen]] to face [[Roberto Alomar]].  After Alomar grounded out, Andersen would then hit [[Tony Fernandez]] with a pitch and walk [[Ed Sprague, Jr.|Ed Sprague]] to load the bases.  Andersen would then get out of the inning by inducing a pop-fly to [[Pat Borders]].  This would become significant in the next inning, with the batting order reset to the top with [[Rickey Henderson]] leading off.\n\nPhiladelphia closer [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] came on to pitch the bottom of the ninth with his team clinging to a 6\u20135 lead. After beginning the inning by walking [[Rickey Henderson]], Williams tried to counter Henderson's speed by using a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to the game, Williams had never used the slide-step delivery in his career, and this may have cut back on his velocity. The walk to Henderson was followed by a [[Devon White (baseball)|Devon White]] fly out and a single by [[Paul Molitor]] that moved Henderson to second.\n\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|thumb|260px|Fireworks in the SkyDome after Carter's home run.]]\n[[Joe Carter]] came up next and, with the count 2\u20132, he hit a three-run home run to win the game and the World Series. Just before the fifth and final pitch to Joe Carter, [[CBS Sports]] announcer [[Tim McCarver]] commented that Carter (relatively unproductive in the Series to date) looked awkward and uncomfortable at the plate. The same pitch allowed Blue Jays radio announcer [[Tom Cheek]] the opportunity to utter his famous \"Touch 'em all, Joe\" quote, when Joe Carter clinched the series. Carter joined [[Bill Mazeroski]] as one of the only two players to win a World Series with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\nCarter was actively involved in the final play of the World Series for the second year in a row. In the [[1992 World Series|previous year]], Carter caught the final out as first baseman after relief pitcher [[Mike Timlin]] fielded [[Otis Nixon]]'s bunt. Taking the 1993 ALCS into account (where he caught the final out in the outfield), he had been involved in the final play of three straight postseason series.\n\nAmerican League president [[Bobby Brown (third baseman)|Dr. Bobby Brown]] presented the [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|World Series Trophy]] instead of the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]]; this event also occurred in [[1992 World Series|the year before]].\n\n==Composite box==\n1993 World Series '''(4\u20132): [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (A.L.)''' over [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (N.L.)\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[Toronto Blue Jays]]'''\n|R1=9|R2=2|R3=6|R4=3|R5=2|R6=5|R7=6|R8=7|R9=5|RR=45|RH=64|RE=7\n|Home='''[[Philadelphia Phillies]]'''\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=6|H4=2|H5=6|H6=2|H7=8|H8=0|H9=2|HR=36|HH=58|HE=2\n|TotalAttendance=344,394 |AveAttendance=57,399\n|WinPlayerShare=$127,921 |LosePlayerShare=$91,222<ref name=\"wsshares\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml|title=World Series Gate Receipts and Player Shares|accessdate=June 14, 2009|publisher=Baseball Almanac| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090502011628/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wsshares.shtml| archivedate= May 2, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Blue Jays became the second expansion team to win two World Series championships, following the [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in {{wsy|1986}}.

The Blue Jays did not qualify for the playoffs again until the [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|2015 season]]. This was the last time a team from Toronto made it to a championship round of one of the four major sports and the last professional sports championship in the four major sports  for the city of Toronto until the [[2018-19 Toronto Raptors season|Toronto Raptors]] made it to the [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] 26 years later in 2019 and won.\n\nBy accumulating 45 runs over the course of the series, the Blue Jays scored the highest number of runs of any one ''series-winning'' team in World Series history.  Only the series-losing [[1960 World Series|1960 New York Yankees]] accumulated more runs, 55, in a series. Coincidentally, that series also ended on a walk off home run.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nGame 6 (October 23) is to date, the last Major League Baseball game to be televised on [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]]. [[Sean McDonough]] (play-by-play) and [[Tim McCarver]] (color commentary and himself a former [[List of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters|Phillies broadcaster]]) called the action for CBS. The following season, Major League Baseball entered into a revenue sharing [[joint venture]] with [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] called [[The Baseball Network]], but that joint venture was cancelled after two seasons, and by 1996, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] took over the broadcasting rights to MLB games. CBS' [[Andrea Joyce]] became the first woman to co-host (alongside [[Pat O'Brien (radio and television personality)|Pat O'Brien]]) a World Series. Serving as field reporters for CBS were [[Lesley Visser]] (in the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]]' dugout) and [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] (in the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]]' dugout)\n\nThe national radio broadcast was also provided by [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS]], with [[Vin Scully]] and [[Johnny Bench]] on the call. Locally, the Series was called on [[WPHT|WOGL-AM]] in Philadelphia by [[Harry Kalas]], [[Richie Ashburn]], [[Chris Wheeler]], [[Andy Musser]], and [[Garry Maddox]] and on [[CJCL (AM)|CJCL-AM]] in Toronto by [[Jerry Howarth]] and [[Tom Cheek]]. Cheek's famous call of the Carter home run (\"Touch 'em all Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\") lives on in Blue Jays folklore.\n\nThe 1993 series was Richie Ashburn's last as a Phillies broadcaster, as he died in [[1997 Philadelphia Phillies season|1997]]. Andy Musser also called his last World Series as a member of the Phillies' broadcast team; he retired in [[2001 Philadelphia Phillies season|2001]] and died eleven years later. Tom Cheek never called another postseason game in his role as voice of the Blue Jays, from which he retired in [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] prior to his death from [[brain cancer]]. Game 6 also marked Johnny Bench's final broadcast for CBS Radio after nine years (he would be replaced on CBS Radio's World Series broadcasts by [[Jeff Torborg]]), while Harry Kalas would not call another World Series until 2008. Kalas later died in [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|2009]] prior to a game at [[Nationals Park]] in Washington, D.C.. Chris Wheeler continued to call games for the Phillies until being released in 2014 and Jerry Howarth continued to call Blue Jays games, moving into the primary play-by-play position following the death of Cheek, until his retirement before the [[2018 Toronto Blue Jays season|2018 season]]. Howarth would return to call postseason games when the Blue Jays qualified in [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|2015]] and [[2016 Toronto Blue Jays season|2016]], where they were eliminated in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] both years.\n\n===The Joe Carter home run calls===\n*[[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]], with [[Vin Scully]]:\n\n::''Fastball is hit to left field, down the line, in the corner, home run! Joe Carter who took the 2 and 0 pitch for a strike right down the middle hits the 2 and 1 (sic) pitch over the left field wall and the Toronto Blue Jays come back with 3 in the bottom of the ninth inning to become the World Champions yet again. The final score: Toronto 8, Philadelphia 6.''\n\n*[[CJCL (AM)|CJCL-AM Radio]] in [[List of Toronto Blue Jays broadcasters|Toronto]] by [[Tom Cheek]]:\n\n::''Joe has had his moments. Trying to lay off that ball, low to the outside part of the plate, he just went after one. Two balls and two strikes on him. Here's the pitch on the way. A swing and a belt! Left field, way back, BLUE JAYS WIN IT! The Blue Jays are World Series Champions, as Joe Carter hits a three-run home run in the ninth inning and the Blue Jays have repeated as World Series Champions! Touch 'em all, Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!''\n\n*[[WPHT|WOGL-AM Radio]] in [[List of Philadelphia Phillies broadcasters|Philadelphia]] by [[Harry Kalas]]:\n\n::''The 2\u20132 pitch, line drive in deep left, this ball is outta here.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Three other airlines took legal action to try to prevent the company from its planned strategy of undercutting their prices by flying only within Texas and thus being exempt from various regulations. The lawsuits were resolved in 1970, and in 1971 the airline began operating regularly scheduled flights between [[Dallas Love Field]] and [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston]] and between Love Field and [[San Antonio International Airport|San Antonio]], and adopted the name Southwest Airlines Co.

On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls \"Ronnie\" urf Ranveer Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the restaurant Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers. \n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronny remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronny and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it. \n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter. \n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronny meets an anonymous man who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD, and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist. \n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronny leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies. \n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realises that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence. \n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie\u2019s illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship. \n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn\u2019t his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and sweet memories of Neha. \n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tiger Shroff]] as Captain Ranveer Pratap Singh (Ronnie) (Neha's former boyfriend and Rhea's father)\n* [[Disha Patani]] as Neha Salgaonkar n\u00e9e Rawat (Ronnie's former girlfriend, Rhea's mother and Shekhar's wife)<ref name=HT2122018>{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/baaghi-2-trailer-tiger-shroff-our-desi-rambo-returns-there-is-an-army-of-villains-to-keep-him-busy/story-5hzeQNEoVuFBIYNzBRUIaM.html|title=Baaghi 2 trailer: Aditya, our desi Rambo, returns.

On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers. \n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronny remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronny and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it. \n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter. \n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronny meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD, and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist. \n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronny leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies. \n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realises that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence. \n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie\u2019s illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago.
