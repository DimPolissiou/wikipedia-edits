In the Bible, it often appears in reference to the fate of the unfaithful. Brimstone, an archaic term synonymous with [[sulfur]],<ref>{{Wiktionary-inline|brimstone}}</ref> evokes the acrid odor of sulphur dioxide given off by [[lightning]] strikes.<ref>Gerald Kutney, ''Sulfur: History, Technology, Applications & Industry''. ChemTec Publishing, 2007. pp. 5</ref> Lightning was understood as divine punishment by many ancient religions; the association of sulfur with divine retribution is common in the Bible. \n\nThe idiomatic English translation of \"fire and brimstone\" is found in the Christian [[King James Version]] translation of the Hebrew Bible and was also later used in the [[Jewish_English_Bible_translations#Old_JPS_(1917)|1917 translation of the Jewish Publication Society]]. The [[Jewish_English_Bible_translations#Isaac_Leeser_translation|1857 Leeser translation of the Tanakh]] inconsistently uses both \"sulfur\" and \"brimstone\" to translate \u05d2\u05c7\u05bc\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05a3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u0591\u05e9\u05c1. The translation used by the [[Jewish_English_Bible_translations#New_JPS_(1985)|1985 New JPS]] is \"sulfurous fire\" while the 1978 Christian [[New International Version]] translation uses \"burning sulfur.\" \n\nUsed as an adjective, fire-and-brimstone often refers to a style of Christian [[sermon|preaching]] that uses vivid descriptions of judgment and eternal [[damnation]] to encourage [[repentance]] especially popular during historical periods of [[Great Awakening]].<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\n==Biblical references==\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] both uses the phrase \"fire and brimstone\" in the context of divine punishment. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19, [[God]] destroys [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] with a rain of fire and brimstone ({{Lang-he|\u05d2\u05c7\u05bc\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05a3\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u0591\u05e9\u05c1}}), and in [[Deuteronomy]] 29, the Israelites are warned that the same punishment would fall upon them should they abandon their covenant with God.
