Moritz]] and written by [[Rich Wilkes]]. The first installment in the [[XXX (film series)|''XXX'' film series]], the film stars [[Vin Diesel]] as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking [[extreme sport]]s enthusiast, [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] and rebellious athlete-turned reluctant spy for the [[National Security Agency]]. Cage is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars [[Asia Argento]], [[Marton Csokas]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Cohen, Moritz and Diesel had previously worked on ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001) as director, producer and cast member respectively.\n\nThe film grossed $277.4 million worldwide<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web |title =XXX (2002) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=xxx.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate = August 6, 2011 }}</ref> and was followed by two sequels, ''[[XXX: State of the Union|State of the Union]]'' and ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage|Return of Xander Cage]]'', released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nA biochemical weapon, \"Silent Night,\" presumed missing since [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union]], is obtained by Anarchy 99, a Russian terrorist group with formal military training. The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] send an undercover agent to recover the weapon, but Anarchy 99's skills easily see through the deception and assassinate him.\n\nNSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests that they need to send someone who [[Black operation|lacks ties to the US government]]. Gibbons identifies Xander Cage, an extreme sports professional known as \"XXX (Triple X)\" but also wanted by the FBI for his acts of protest against a leading senator. Gibbons's team abducts Cage, and puts him through two field tests, stopping a staged diner robbery, and escaping from a Colombian cartel's plantation in the midst of an army raid. Cage passes, and Gibbons offers him the job, promising to wipe his criminal records clean or otherwise sending him to prison. Cage reluctantly accepts the job.\n\nCage is sent to [[Prague]] to meet with the NSA support team, which includes Czech agent Milan Sova. Sova has been tasked to watch Cage and deport him back to America should he fall out of line, quickly riling Cage. During their first task, scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely identifies Sova as a police officer to Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi, earning him favor with the group, which is enhanced when Yorgi's brother Kolya reveals he is a fan of Cage. Cage tells Yorgi that he is in the club to make a deal with Yorgi about high end sports cars. Cage hands him the list and Yorgi immediately identifies that the tenth car on the list, a [[Pontiac GTO#1967|1967 Pontiac GTO]] would be hard to find in Europe. When he hands the list to Yelena, his girlfriend and lieutenant, she and Cage have an argument about the price of the deal. At the end of their argument, Cage asks her about an account number and is provided with one.\n\nThe next morning, Gibbons calls Cage about changes to the list of cars, but is impressed when Cage gives them loads of information on Anarchy 99, thanks to Kolya eagerly providing to please his idol. Impressed by his work, Gibbons sends tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers, who provides Cage with a special revolver, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages. Later, Cage attends the car deal he made earlier with Yorgi in a warehouse which Sova attempts to intercede. Cage appears to shoot Sova with his special field revolver and kill him. Thus earning him Yorgi's trust and in return, Yorgi makes Cage a member of Anarchy 99; in reality, Cage was able to use fake blood splatter darts to fake Sova's death.\n\nYorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena attempting to investigate Yorgi's secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter, and reveals his true identity. Meanwhile, Sova betrays Cage and reveals his true identity to Yorgi on  the phone. Furious, Yorgi sends his trusted sniper Kirill to take Cage out after tracing his location. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena contacts her to tell her that they already know of Cage's identity, making him a liability to their group. Cage and Yelena stage a fight to escape, but the NSA suddenly appears to capture Cage, while Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.\n\nCage meets with Gibbons in an opera house who demands that he return to America now that his cover is blown, and that special forces are planning to siege the castle to recover the weapon. Cage refuses, fearing for Yelena's life by stating that he sent her back to retrieve more information for Gibbons and his group, as well as being bitter that Sova purposely blew his cover. Later that night, he sneaks into Yorgi's castle to know more about Yorgi's plans. He follows Yorgi into a secret underground lab in the castle overhearing Yorgi's plan to launch \"Silent Night\" from a water-borne drone named Ahab into several major cities after witnessing Yorgi killing all of the scientists that worked to create the drone and the bio agent by detonating a loaded missile through his special binoculars, Cage flees the area after killing Yorgi's brother Kolya with a special bandage bomb. He goes to back to his hideout where he finds Sova waiting for him. He explains that he switched sides because Yorgi offered him more payment than the US Government. Just as he is about to shoot Cage, he is killed from inbound gunfire from the door. Yelena arrives with two men, the Ivans whom Cage had met earlier. She explains that she is an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] agent that started to get close to Yorgi two years before, but her handlers abandoned her. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA on the condition that the US Government give Yelena asylum in the country, who prepare a coordinated attack on the castle. Going against orders to leave, Cage gives his car to Shavers and tells him to load it up with as much weaponry as he can. Cage then paratroops from a plane on a snowboard in a snowy region of Czech Republic where the communication tower of Anarchy 99 is located. Upon chase by the members of the group, he starts an avalanche and in turn destroys the tower used by Anarachy 99 in order to aid the NSA. However, he is captured by Yorgi, who already knew of Yelena's true identity. Just as Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces launch their attack. Cage and Yelena free their restraints and Cage kills Yorgi, but not before he launches Ahab, armed with \"Silent Night,\" towards the center of Prague.\n\nCage contacts Gibbons, who notifies the Czech military to prepare to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, even though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his car, now heavily modified by Agent Shavers, to race alongside the river to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons the drone and crosses over to it, and is able to disable the weapon moments before it goes off. Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises to Cage as well as providing Yelena with American citizenship. Later, Cage and Yelena are relaxing in [[Bora Bora]] when Gibbons contacts Cage to offer him another mission. Cage ignores him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Xander Cage (also known by his nickname \"Triple X\"): A [[thrill seeking]] [[United States|American]] [[extreme sports]] enthusiast, [[stuntman]] and [[anti-establishment]] activist. Idolized in some sub-cultures, xXx is also hunted by the authorities and he is offered a deal to become a [[spy]] for the [[National Security Agency]] in exchange for leniency, the agency requiring an agent who can do the current job without the military professional training that Anarchy 99's background will allow them to recognise.\n* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as Augustus Gibbons: A high-ranking official in the [[National Security Agency]] who has the power to give xXx a pardon for his crimes.

Moritz]] and written by [[Rich Wilkes]]. The first installment in the [[XXX (film series)|''XXX'' film series]], the film stars [[Vin Diesel]] as Xander Cage, a thrill-seeking [[extreme sport]]s enthusiast, [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] and rebellious athlete-turned reluctant spy for the [[National Security Agency]]. Cage is sent on a dangerous mission to infiltrate a group of potential Russian terrorists in Central Europe. The film also stars [[Asia Argento]], [[Marton Csokas]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Cohen, Moritz and Diesel had previously worked on ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001) as director, producer and cast member respectively.\n\nThe film grossed $277.4 million worldwide<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web |title =XXX (2002) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=xxx.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate = August 6, 2011 }}</ref> and was followed by two sequels, ''[[XXX: State of the Union|State of the Union]]'' and ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage|Return of Xander Cage]]'', released in 2005 and 2017, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nA biochemical weapon, \"Silent Night,\" presumed missing since [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union]], is obtained by Anarchy 99, a Russian terrorist group with formal military training. The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] send an undercover agent to recover the weapon, but Anarchy 99's skills easily see through the deception and assassinate him.\n\nNSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests that they need to send someone who [[Black operation|lacks ties to the US government]]. Gibbons identifies Xander Cage, an extreme sports professional known as \"XXX (Triple X)\" but also wanted by the FBI for his acts of protest against a leading senator. Gibbons's team abducts Cage, and puts him through two field tests, stopping a staged diner robbery, and escaping from a Colombian cartel's plantation in the midst of an army raid. Cage passes, and Gibbons offers him the job, promising to wipe his criminal records clean or otherwise sending him to prison. Cage reluctantly accepts the job.\n\nCage is sent to [[Prague]] to meet with the NSA support team, which includes Czech agent Milan Sova. Sova has been tasked to watch Cage and deport him back to America should he fall out of line, quickly riling Cage. During their first task, scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage purposely identifies Sova as a police officer to Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi, earning him favor with the group, which is enhanced when Yorgi's brother Kolya reveals he is a fan of Cage. Cage tells Yorgi that he is in the club to make a deal with Yorgi about high end sports cars. Cage hands him the list and Yorgi immediately identifies that the tenth car on the list, a [[Pontiac GTO#1967|1967 Pontiac GTO]] would be hard to find in Europe. When he hands the list to Yelena, his girlfriend and lieutenant, she and Cage have an argument about the price of the deal. At the end of their argument, Cage asks her about an account number and is provided with one.\n\nThe next morning, Gibbons calls Cage about changes to the list of cars, but is impressed when Cage gives them loads of information on Anarchy 99, thanks to Kolya eagerly providing to please his idol. Impressed by his work, Gibbons sends tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers, who provides Cage with a special revolver, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages. Later, Cage attends the car deal he made earlier with Yorgi in a warehouse which Sova attempts to intercede. Cage appears to shoot Sova with his special field revolver and kill him. Thus earning him Yorgi's trust and in return, Yorgi makes Cage a member of Anarchy 99; in reality, Cage was able to use fake blood splatter darts to fake Sova's death.\n\nYorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena attempting to investigate Yorgi's secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter, and reveals his true identity. Meanwhile, Sova betrays Cage and reveals his true identity to Yorgi on  the phone. Furious, Yorgi sends his trusted sniper Kirill to take Cage out after tracing his location. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena contacts her to tell her that they already know of Cage's identity, making him a liability to their group. Cage and Yelena stage a fight to escape, but the NSA suddenly appears to capture Cage, while Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99.\n\nCage meets with Gibbons in an opera house who demands that he return to America now that his cover is blown, and that special forces are planning to siege the castle to recover the weapon. Cage refuses, fearing for Yelena's life by stating that he sent her back to retrieve more information for Gibbons and his group, as well as being bitter that Sova purposely blew his cover. Later that night, he sneaks into Yorgi's castle to know more about Yorgi's plans. He follows Yorgi into a secret underground lab in the castle overhearing Yorgi's plan to launch \"Silent Night\" from a water-borne drone named Ahab into several major cities after witnessing Yorgi killing all of the scientists that worked to create the drone and the bio agent by detonating a loaded missile through his special binoculars, Cage flees the area after killing Yorgi's brother Kolya with a special bandage bomb. He goes to back to his hideout where he finds Sova waiting for him. He explains that he switched sides because Yorgi offered him more payment than the US Government. Just as he is about to shoot Cage, he is killed from inbound gunfire from the door. Yelena arrives with two men, the Ivans whom Cage had met earlier. She explains that she is an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] agent that started to get close to Yorgi two years before, but her handlers abandoned her. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA on the condition that the US Government give Yelena asylum in the country, who prepare a coordinated attack on the castle. Going against orders to leave, Cage gives his car to Shavers and tells him to load it up with as much weaponry as he can. Cage then paratroops from a plane on a snowboard in a snowy region of Czech Republic where the communication tower of Anarchy 99 is located. Upon chase by the members of the group, he starts an avalanche and in turn destroys the tower used by Anarachy 99 in order to aid the NSA. However, he is captured by Yorgi, who already knew of Yelena's true identity. Just as Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces launch their attack. Cage and Yelena free their restraints and Cage kills Yorgi, but not before he launches Ahab, armed with \"Silent Night,\" towards the center of Prague.\n\nCage contacts Gibbons, who notifies the Czech military to prepare to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, even though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his car, now heavily modified by Agent Shavers, to race alongside the river to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons the drone and crosses over to it, and is able to disable the weapon moments before it goes off. Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises to Cage as well as providing Yelena with American citizenship. Later, Cage and Yelena are relaxing in [[Bora Bora]] when Gibbons contacts Cage to offer him another mission. Cage ignores him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Xander Cage (also known by his nickname \"Triple X\"): A [[thrill seeking]] [[United States|American]] [[extreme sports]] enthusiast, [[stuntman]] and [[anti-establishment]] activist.

The city is surrounded by the [[County of Grande Prairie No. 1]].\n\nGrande Prairie was the [[List of cities in Alberta|seventh-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,166,<ref name=2016censusABmunis/> and was one of Canada's fastest growing cities between 2001 and 2006.<ref name=2006highest>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-550/Index.cfm?TPL=P1C&Page=RETR&LANG=Eng&T=307&SR=1&S=5&O=D |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population, 2006 and 2001 censuses - 100% data |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe city adopted the [[trumpeter swan]] as an official symbol due to its proximity to the migration route and summer nesting grounds of this bird. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\". The dinosaur has emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of the Grande Prairie.\n\n== History ==\n\nGrande Prairie was named for the large prairie which lies to the north, east, and west of it. In the 18th century, the prairie was occupied by bands of the [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver) peoples, who began trading with the [[North West Company]] at [[Dunvegan, Alberta|Dunvegan]] in the early 19th century. The earliest recorded reference to the prairie was by trader [[Samuel Black]] in 1824. In 1880, a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post called La Grande Prairie was established by George Kennedy {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the present city. In the late 19th century, the prairie was settled by [[Cree]] and [[Iroquois]] from around [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and [[Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)|Lac Ste. Anne]]. When 17 [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were surveyed for homesteading in 1909, a land rush soon followed, with many settlers arriving over the Edson Trail. In 1910, the Grande Prairie Townsite was sub-divided. By 1912, it included a bank, hotel, post office, and land office, making it a district metropolis. In 1916, it became the terminus of the [[Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe Edson Trail from [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]] to Grande Prairie was opened in 1911 as a means for settlers to reach the Grande Prairie area. It was basically nothing more than a tract of clear cut bush and forest, and thus was a very difficult route for many settlers, especially during wet weather. Because of this, large scale settlement came late compared to other major farming regions further south in Canada. Grande Prairie was incorporated as a village by the Province of Alberta in 1914. It was not until the arrival of the railway in 1916 that farmland quickly expanded as waves of settlers came into the Peace region. This drove up Grande Prairie's population past the 1,000 mark, allowing it to incorporate as a town on March 27, 1919. A local [[Depression of 1920\u201321|recession in the 1920s]] caused a temporary depopulation of Grande Prairie. But the population rebounded afterwards by the 1930s, by which time the population had reached 1,464. Settlement continued unabated even into the 1930s during the [[Dust Bowl]] era because the Peace Region was able to escape the severe drought conditions that plagued the [[Canadian Prairies]] further south at the time.<ref>David W.

Although Dawson Creek was chosen as the major starting point of the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]], Grande Prairie was a major stopover point for military aircraft during the war, and benefited economically from this.\n\nAlthough Grande Prairie was well located in the southern edge of the Peace Country, it was competing with the towns of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] and Dawson Creek for the title of the most important centre of commerce and agriculture in the region until the late 1950s, when its population growth began to outstrip these towns as oil and natural gas exploration was underway in the Peace Region, especially since the first major discovery of oil further south in [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]] near Edmonton in 1947 and the construction of a large pulp mill in the early 1970s.\n\nThe construction and paving of [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] (originally sections of Highways 2, 34, and 43 from the BC border to the Yellowhead Highway just west of Edmonton) in 1956 cut down on the travel time by road significantly, further enhancing Grande Prairie's accessibility and economic status. The town was incorporated as a city in 1958. At that time, its population was approximately 7,600.\n\nThe opening of the [[Procter & Gamble]] kraft [[pulp mill]] in 1972 and the discovery of the [[Elmworth]] deep basin gas field spurred an economic boom. Grande Prairie's population went from just over 12,000 in the early 1970s to over 24,000 by the time the oil boom went bust in 1981.\n\nA [[tornado]] struck the downtown area and east side of Grande Prairie on July 8, 2004. Although the tornado was considered a very weak one (F0-F1 on the [[Fujita scale]]) and the weather was not severe at the time, it was still strong enough to damage houses and flip vehicles. There were no casualties or deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta cleaning up from tornado |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/09/tornado_alberta040709.html |work=CBC News |date=July 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Village of Grande Prairie, Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|A view of downtown Grande Prairie, circa 1914]]\nGrande Prairie is located just north of the [[55th parallel north]], and is {{convert|465|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of {{convert|669|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The city is surrounded by farmland to the north, east, and west. To the south lies a vast [[Taiga|boreal forest]] with aspen, tamarack, lodgepole pine, jack pine, and black spruce extending well into the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]] south and southwest of the city.\n\nBear Creek goes through the city from the northwest to the south end and is a tributary of the [[Wapiti River]] to the south. The Bear Creek Reservoir is the small body of water by [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] in the northwest part of the city, and is ringed by marshy wetland. The terrain immediately surrounding Grande Prairie is largely flat to gently rolling, but rises gradually to hilly terrain closer to the foothills to the south and southwest. On clear days, some peaks in the Rockies are visible to the southwest from Grande Prairie.\n\nThe city lies on the southern edge of [[aspen parkland]], which is a [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between boreal forest and [[prairie]]. The [[Peace River Country]] contains the northernmost area of aspen parkland in North America. However, much of the aspen parkland in the region has long since been destroyed by extensive farming and oil/gas drilling activity.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGrande Prairie has a northern continental climate typical of northwestern [[Alberta]] and northeastern [[British Columbia]], classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb''), bordering closely on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') with old data under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are generally very cold with some mild spells. Summers are often fairly cool to pleasantly warm in the daytime, but nights can be cool despite the long summer days typical for its latitude. Hot days over {{convert|30|C}} are rare, occurring on average only two to three days a year, which is not unexpected this far north. Winter conditions can vary tremendously from year to year. Winters have been known to be mild enough to produce \"brown Christmas\" conditions, where little or no snow may fall until after Christmas due to unusually mild early winter conditions.\n\nThe average January temperature is {{convert|\u221213.6|C|1}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|16.2|C|1}}. However, temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221252.2|C|0}} and as high as {{convert|35.6|C|0}}<ref name=\"CCN\"/> have been recorded; the extreme [[humidex]] and [[wind chill]] readings are {{convert|40.8|and|\u221263.0|C|0}}, respectively. The city receives {{convert|445|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, including {{convert|322|mm|abbr=on}} of rain and {{convert|154|cm|abbr=on}} of snow. Snowfall amounts, however, vary greatly from year to year. Being fairly close to the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]], it can get quite windy in Grande Prairie, especially in the spring and fall. [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]] may occur in and bring winter thaws to the Grande Prairie area.\nGrande Prairie has 314 days with measureable sunshine per year on average, and just above 2,200 hours of bright sunshine or about 46.1% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 31.2% in November to a high of 59.1% in July.<ref name = climate/>\n\nSummers can bring thunderstorms, although they are not as frequent nor as severe as those further south in [[Central Alberta]]. Rainfall can vary from year to year, but the Peace Region is noted for never{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} having experienced truly severe drought conditions more typical of [[Southern Alberta]] and neighbouring [[Saskatchewan]]. Tornadoes are rare but not unheard of in the Peace Region and, as noted above, a weak tornado actually struck the core of the city in 2004.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Grande Prairie Airport]],

Major industries include oil and gas, agriculture, forestry, and food services.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/cityofgp/docs/city_of_grande_prairie_economic_pro_17dcdbee1af8ec/1?ff=true&e=2784359/47593705 |title=2017 Economic Profile |publisher=Department of Economic Development: City of Grande Prairie |type=PDF |pages=33-39 (PDF pages 33-39) |date=March 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAgriculture was the first economic mainstay of Grande Prairie since settlement began in the early 20th century. It remains part of the local economy today. A variety of crops such as [[barley]], [[wheat]], [[canola]], and [[oat]]s are grown in the area. [[Livestock]] such as [[cattle]] and [[bison|buffalo (bison)]] are also raised in the area. Despite being north of the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]], the climate is mild enough to allow for farming on a large scale to prosper. Longer daylight hours during the summer at this latitude aid in crop production. The Peace Country is the northernmost major farming region in [[North America]]. Land within the region is still being cleared for new farmland.\n\nAlthough some oil and gas drilling has been ongoing in the area since the 1950s, oil and gas exploration did not begin to occur on a large scale until the late 1970s. It was in the mid to late-1970s that the Elmworth gas field was discovered and developed, causing the city to grow rapidly until the oil boom ended in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=667&from=mm |title=History of Grande Prairie |publisher= City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=2014-11-23}}</ref> Today Grande Prairie's location atop both the [[Montney Formation|Montney]] and [[Duvernay Formation|Duvernay]] geological formations have seen local extraction activities focused on [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[shale gas]]. As a result of this focus the region has maintained relatively high levels of activity<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/deep-in-the-montney-grande-prairie-is-first-to-emerge-from-albertas-brutal-recession|title=Deep in the Montney, Grande Prairie first to emerge from brutal recession {{!}} Financial Post|last=Commodities|last2=Energy|date=2017-07-20|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> when compared to areas where conventional resources, shallow gas or heavy oil are the primary resources. \n\nForestry is a major part of Grande Prairie's economy, for large tracts of forest lie to the south in the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]]. [[International Paper]] (formerly [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Canada]]) [[Kraft process|kraft]] pulp mill, opened in 1972 by [[Procter & Gamble]], is one of Grande Prairie's largest employers. [[Canfor]] runs a sawmill and lumber yard operation on the west side of the city. [[Norbord]] (formerly Ainsworth) [[oriented strand board]] plant opened in late 1995.\n\nGrande Prairie serves as the economic and transportation hub for a trading area of nearly 250,000 people.

It is a {{convert|41,000|sqft|abbr=on}}. building with many exhibits, a National Geographic Theatre, classrooms, a Paleontology Lab, a gift shop and a restaurant. The museum is named after [[Philip J. Currie]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dinomuseum.ca/visit/about-the-museum/ |title=About The Museum |publisher=Phillip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum |accessdate=2017-11-23}}</ref> from the [[University of Alberta]], who has contributed to the understanding of the link between dinosaurs and birds.\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\nIn 1995, the city hosted the [[Canada Games]]. The event was televised nationally on [[CBC Television]]. Hundreds of performers competed in the events and the city gained status and recognition as a result. The city played host to the [[2010 Arctic Winter Games]] from March 6\u201313, 2010.\n\nThere are a number of parks in Grande Prairie, including the large Muskoseepi Park in the Bear Creek valley which winds its way throughout the city. Muskoseepi Park has excellent bike trails extending nearly the entire length of Bear Creek, from the northwest to the southeast of the city. The park also contains the Ernie Radbourne Pavilion, the outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool and the outdoor Muskoseepi Park Pond which converts into a skating rink in the winter.\n\nCrystal Lake in the northeast part of the city also has parkland, preserved wetlands (great for birdwatching), and walking/bike paths around its entire circumference.\n\nNestled within spruce and pine trees, on the south east side of the city, just a couple of minutes from downtown, is Evergreen Park. The park and facilities are home to the annual [[Grande Prairie Stompede]] event, which draws upwards of 30,000 people annually. The park is the largest full featured exhibition facility north of Edmonton, and can cater to upwards of 10,000 people at a time. It has a restaurant (open daily) and a lounge, and hosts events such as agricultural shows, rodeos, chuckwagon races, horse racing, sportsman and RV shows. A variety of halls, convention spaces and conference facilities all with paved parking are available. The largest building, the Entrec Centre has {{convert|105,000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space, with a {{convert|46,000|sqft|abbr=on}} main hall, and has hosted many concerts and trade shows in the past. Evergreen Park also has a 76 spot RV and Marine Campground which is open in the summer from May to October, as well as an archery centre, an equestrian facility, and 12 baseball diamonds.\n\nGrande Prairie has three 18-hole golf courses, The Dunes Golf and Winter Club, the Bear Creek Golf Club, and the Grande Prairie Golf and Country Club. A fourth golf course, Grovedale Golf Course, is also located approximately {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} to the southwest of the city.<ref name=golfcourses>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverthepeacecountry.com/htmlpages/golf.html |title=Grande Prairie \u2013 Golf |publisher=Discover the Peace Country Visitors Guide |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 2017, a new nine hole course, ''The Bear Paw Golf Course'', with a par level of 3 opened up in the ''South Bear Creek Recreation Area.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=506 |title=Bear Paw Par |publisher=City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Alpine skiing|Downhill skiing]] is popular in Grande Prairie,{{fact|date=April 2019}} which has a local ski hill called Nitehawk and is located south of the city on the south bank of the Wapiti River. Aside from skiing, Nitehawk also has the only North American natural luge track certified for international events,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and over the summer months freestyle ski jumpers practice using the Northern Extreme water ramp facility.{{fact|date=April 2019}} It is also active in [[luge]] as a [[refrigeration|naturally refrigerated]] venue, hosting the [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships]] in [[FIL World Luge Natural Track Championships 2007|2007]].\n\nCross-country skiing is also common during the winter. The Wapiti Nordic Ski Club is one of Canada's premier cross country skiing and biathlon facilities,{{fact|date=April 2019}} and is just south of the city. There are over {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} of both classical and skate skiing trails, as well as {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} of nightly lit trails. There are also snowshoe trails as well as dog friendly trails. In the summer, the trails are used for hiking, mountain biking, and running.\n\nThe foothills south of Grande Prairie and around [[Grande Cache]] are visited year-round for hiking in the summer and for snowmobiling and other winter sports in the winter. [[Kakwa Wildland Park]] on the Alberta-BC border, about {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} south of the city, is a mountainous natural area and is known for the Kakwa Falls.\n\nOn the South side of the city, off of Resources Road, is the Wapiti Shooters Club. The club was founded in 1949, and due to the many upgrades over the years is considered one of the finest shooting clubs in Alberta. It offers Shotgun (Trap, Sporting Clays, and Skeet), Handgun (outdoor 12 lanes, indoor 6 lanes), and a {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} outdoor covered rifle range. The club is also used for business functions, birthday parties, RCMP, Sheriff, and Safety training. Over the years many top level coaches and athletes from all over Canada have trained or entered into events at the club. In addition, the club is currently developing a long ({{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}) rifle range suitable for high power rifles, north of the city.\n\nGrande Prairie also has a new and modern, $110 million, {{convert|450,000|sqft|abbr=on}} health and fitness facility known as the Eastlink Centre, (previously known as the Multiplex). It is a large indoor fitness facility that has two indoor pools (a 50-meter Olympic sized pool, and a 25-meter, wheelchair accessible, higher temperature, Program Pool), a splash park, a lazy river, waterslides, and a surf simulator. It also includes a large weight room, squash and racquetball courts, fitness classes, a daycare service, a multi-use basketball court, a summer outdoor 5,000 sq. ft. concrete skateboard park,  and additional other amenities and classes. The Eastlink Centre is located in southwest Grande Prairie and connects St. Joseph High School, the Grande Prairie Gymnastics Centre, and the Coca-Cola Centre.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Facility|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/about/about-the-facility|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> In March 2012 the Eastlink Centre received an award for its exceptional accessibility features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastlink Centre Honoured For Accessibility Features|url=http://www.eastlinkcentre.ca/images/stories/pdf/media/news_release_eastlink%20centre%20award.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Outdoor Bear Creek Swimming Pool, in Muskoseepi Park, was reopened in the summer of 2019, after extensive modifications.  The new renovations include a Tots Pool, a Zero Beach, Spanish Steps, Lily Islands, a Games Area, and a Waterslide.\n\nThe Leisure Centre (previously known as the Rec-Plex) is located in northwest Grande Prairie near the Bear Creek Reservoir. In December 2011, after the Eastlink Centre opened, the majority of the Leisure Centre was closed, with unrealized plans to reopen in the second half of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Leisure Centre|url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=157|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Currently the swimming pool and gym remain closed, but the indoor soccer pitch is open for a variety of sports.\n\nOver the years Grande Prairie has played host to many tournaments including:\n*[[2004 Royal Bank Cup]]\n*[[2006 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]]\n*[[2009 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2010 Arctic Winter Games]]\n*[[2011 Players' Championship]]\n*[[2012 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]] ([[Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]])\n*[[2013 Pomeroy Inn & Suites Prairie Showdown]]\n*[[2015 Canada Cup of Curling]]\n*[[2016 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]]\n\n\nThe city also has the following ice hockey teams:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ <!-- initially sorted by date established -->\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Club\n! scope=\"col\" |League\n! scope=\"col\" |Sport\n! scope=\"col\" |Venue\n! scope=\"col\" |Established\n! scope=\"col\" |Championships\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Storm]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Alberta Junior Hockey League|AJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n|[[Revolution Place]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1966 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Kings]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North West Junior Hockey League|NWJHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1994 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\" |[[Grande Prairie Athletics]]\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[North Peace Hockey League|NPHL]]\n|[[Ice hockey]]\n| Crosslink County Sportsplex\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1960 <br/> <small></small>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|}\n\n== Transportation ==\n====Air====\nThe [[Grande Prairie Airport]] is located at the west end of the city and serves the region with daily scheduled flights to [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]]. Two airlines, [[Air Canada Express]] and [[WestJet Encore]], offer service to the airport. The airport has seen growth in both passenger and aircraft traffic in recent years, and now serves just under a half a million passengers annually. The Grande Prairie Airport was originally developed in the 1930s as a grass only strip at its present site. In 1941 in support of the war effort, and the building of the Alaska Highway, the facility was expanded for utilization by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. In 1950 the airport came under the authority of the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] until February 1, 1997, at which time it was transferred to the City of Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Grande Prairie Airport|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information-101/history-2/|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe terminal, built in 1981, was renovated in 2009 making it twice its original size. In 2014, one of the two asphalt runways was extended from {{convert|6501|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8502|ft|abbr=on}} (the other is {{convert|6200|ft|abbr=on}}). Forthcoming expansions include an upgrade to the parking system. Currently the airport has no customs capabilities (although a temporary customs facility was set up for the 2010 Arctic Winter Games). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information/media-publications/most-new-airport-measures-wont-impact-grande-prairie/|title=March 8 2010 Most new airport measures won't impact Grande Prairie {{!}} Grande Prairie Airport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Swanberg Air]] formerly operated out of the airport until they ceased operations in 2011. They flew cargo, scheduled, and charter passenger services in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.\n\n====City public transit====\n[[Grande Prairie Transit]] is a small public transit system with modern buses and a route system integrated throughout the city.\n\n====Intercity bus====\n[[Greyhound Canada]] offered scheduled bus service from its Grande Prairie terminal to Edmonton and [[Dawson Creek]]. This service was terminated in October 2018. [[Pacific Western Transportation#Red Arrow Motorcoach|Red Arrow]] now connects Grande Prairie to Edmonton.\n\n====Highways and roads====\n[[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] is the main highway through the city providing eventual connection to British Columbia to the west and Edmonton to the southeast. Highway 43 meets [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] a few kilometres north of the city at an intersection known locally as Four Mile Corner, then continues south into the city. It travels through the city via a northwest bypass and exits the city on the west end near the airport.\n\nThe stretch of [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] extending north from Grande Prairie to Four Mile Corner and west to the Alberta/BC border was renumbered to Highway 43 in the late 1990s to link with the rest of Highway 43 from Four Mile Corner to the [[Yellowhead Highway]] just west of Edmonton. This explains why newer maps no longer show that stretch west and a few&nbsp;km north of the city as Highway 2. The renumbering was also partly due to Highway 43 now being a part of the CANAMEX trade route and also due to it being widened to a four-lane divided highway for most of its length, the remaining two-lane undivided portion beginning 1.6 km east of the Highway 723 junction. [[Alberta Highway 40|Highway 40]] is the primary access road into Grande Prairie from the south.\n\nConstruction of a new [[Alberta Highway 43#Grande Prairie bypass|Highway 43X]] bypass will skirt the northwest side of the city from Four Mile Corner to Highway 43 just west of where the airport was begun in August 2007<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gov.ab.ca/acn/200708/21983B2544DD5-0D52-9623-579D3412290C6789.html |title= Construction starts on long-awaited Grande Prairie bypass|author= Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation |accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref> (\"Four Mile Corner\" is not an actual settlement - it is an intersection so-named because it is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north of the intersection of Clairmont Road (100th Street) and Richmond Avenue (100th Avenue)). The construction is in two phases, with the first phase under construction and the second currently in the design stage. The first phase extends west to Range Road 63 (116 Street within city limits), while the second phase runs west from Range Road 63 south to Highway 43 west of the airport. This future bypass is intended to replace the current one. The current bypass, which was built in the late 1960s, is no longer functioning well, due to high traffic volumes and new intersections. The rapid population growth of Grande Prairie is contributing to such a high increase in vehicle traffic that traffic jams are now relatively common during peak hours.\n\nGrande Prairie sees many vacationers heading to the [[Alaska Highway]] by road during the summer because Highway 43 leads towards [[Dawson Creek]], BC, which is the \"Mile 0\" of the Alaska Highway.\n\n====Rail====\nThe City of Grande Prairie has rail freight service provided by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Trackage runs south from Grande Prairie to [[Grande Cache]] and [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], where it joins CN's main transcontinental line. CN also operates local freight service out of Grande Prairie on former [[Northern Alberta Railways]] tracks - north to [[Sexsmith, Alberta|Sexsmith]] and [[Rycroft, Alberta|Rycroft]], and west to [[Beaverlodge]] and [[Hythe, Alberta|Hythe]].\n\n[[Savage Alberta Railway]], which operated from 1999 to 2006, was owned by [[North American RailNet]] and had its headquarters in the city prior to being purchased by CN.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Elementary and secondary schools ===\nFour school districts operate schools within Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|url=

It is located at the intersection of [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] (part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]) and [[Alberta Highway 40|Highway 40]] (the Bighorn Highway), approximately {{convert|456|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Edmonton]]. The city is surrounded by the [[County of Grande Prairie No. 1]].\n\nGrande Prairie was the [[List of cities in Alberta|seventh-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,166,<ref name=2016censusABmunis/> and was one of Canada's fastest growing cities between 2001 and 2006.<ref name=2006highest>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-550/Index.cfm?TPL=P1C&Page=RETR&LANG=Eng&T=307&SR=1&S=5&O=D |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population, 2006 and 2001 censuses - 100% data |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe city adopted the [[trumpeter swan]] as an official symbol due to its proximity to the migration route and summer nesting grounds of this bird. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\". The dinosaur has emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of the Grande Prairie.\n\n== History ==\n\nGrande Prairie was named for the large prairie which lies to the north, east, and west of it. In the 18th century, the prairie was occupied by bands of the [[Dane-zaa]] (Beaver) peoples, who began trading with the [[North West Company]] at [[Dunvegan, Alberta|Dunvegan]] in the early 19th century. The earliest recorded reference to the prairie was by trader [[Samuel Black]] in 1824. In 1880, a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] post called La Grande Prairie was established by George Kennedy {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of the present city. In the late 19th century, the prairie was settled by [[Cree]] and [[Iroquois]] from around [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and [[Lac Ste. Anne (Alberta)|Lac Ste. Anne]]. When 17 [[Township (Canada)|townships]] were surveyed for homesteading in 1909, a land rush soon followed, with many settlers arriving over the Edson Trail. In 1910, the Grande Prairie Townsite was sub-divided. By 1912, it included a bank, hotel, post office, and land office, making it a district metropolis. In 1916, it became the terminus of the [[Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway]] from Edmonton.\n\nThe Edson Trail from [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]] to Grande Prairie was opened in 1911 as a means for settlers to reach the Grande Prairie area. It was basically nothing more than a tract of clear cut bush and forest, and thus was a very difficult route for many settlers, especially during wet weather. Because of this, large scale settlement came late compared to other major farming regions further south in Canada. Grande Prairie was incorporated as a village by the Province of Alberta in 1914. It was not until the arrival of the railway in 1916 that farmland quickly expanded as waves of settlers came into the Peace region. This drove up Grande Prairie's population past the 1,000 mark, allowing it to incorporate as a town on March 27, 1919. A local [[Depression of 1920\u201321|recession in the 1920s]] caused a temporary depopulation of Grande Prairie. But the population rebounded afterwards by the 1930s, by which time the population had reached 1,464. Settlement continued unabated even into the 1930s during the [[Dust Bowl]] era because the Peace Region was able to escape the severe drought conditions that plagued the [[Canadian Prairies]] further south at the time.<ref>David W.

Although Dawson Creek was chosen as the major starting point of the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]], Grande Prairie was a major stopover point for military aircraft during the war, and benefited economically from this.\n\nAlthough Grande Prairie was well located in the southern edge of the Peace Country, it was competing with the towns of [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] and Dawson Creek for the title of the most important centre of commerce and agriculture in the region until the late 1950s, when its population growth began to outstrip these towns as oil and natural gas exploration was underway in the Peace Region, especially since the first major discovery of oil further south in [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]] near Edmonton in 1947 and the construction of a large pulp mill in the early 1970s.\n\nThe construction and paving of [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] (originally sections of Highways 2, 34, and 43 from the BC border to the Yellowhead Highway just west of Edmonton) in 1956 cut down on the travel time by road significantly, further enhancing Grande Prairie's accessibility and economic status. The town was incorporated as a city in 1958. At that time, its population was approximately 7,600.\n\nThe opening of the [[Procter & Gamble]] kraft [[pulp mill]] in 1972 and the discovery of the [[Elmworth]] deep basin gas field spurred an economic boom. Grande Prairie's population went from just over 12,000 in the early 1970s to over 24,000 by the time the oil boom went bust in 1981.\n\nA [[tornado]] struck the downtown area and east side of Grande Prairie on July 8, 2004. Although the tornado was considered a very weak one (F0-F1 on the [[Fujita scale]]) and the weather was not severe at the time, it was still strong enough to damage houses and flip vehicles. There were no casualties or deaths.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta cleaning up from tornado |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/09/tornado_alberta040709.html |work=CBC News |date=July 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Village of Grande Prairie, Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|A view of downtown Grande Prairie, circa 1914]]\nGrande Prairie is located just north of the [[55th parallel north]], and is {{convert|465|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Edmonton, lying at an elevation of {{convert|669|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The city is surrounded by farmland to the north, east, and west. To the south lies a vast [[Taiga|boreal forest]] with aspen, tamarack, lodgepole pine, jack pine, and black spruce extending well into the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]] south and southwest of the city.\n\nBear Creek goes through the city from the northwest to the south end and is a tributary of the [[Wapiti River]] to the south. The Bear Creek Reservoir is the small body of water by [[Grande Prairie Regional College]] in the northwest part of the city, and is ringed by marshy wetland. The terrain immediately surrounding Grande Prairie is largely flat to gently rolling, but rises gradually to hilly terrain closer to the foothills to the south and southwest. On clear days, some peaks in the Rockies are visible to the southwest from Grande Prairie.\n\nThe city lies on the southern edge of [[aspen parkland]], which is a [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between boreal forest and [[prairie]]. The [[Peace River Country]] contains the northernmost area of aspen parkland in North America. However, much of the aspen parkland in the region has long since been destroyed by extensive farming and oil/gas drilling activity.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGrande Prairie has a northern continental climate typical of northwestern [[Alberta]] and northeastern [[British Columbia]], classified as [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb''), bordering closely on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dfc'') with old data under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. Winters are generally very cold with some mild spells. Summers are often fairly cool to pleasantly warm in the daytime, but nights can be cool despite the long summer days typical for its latitude. Hot days over {{convert|30|C}} are rare, occurring on average only two to three days a year, which is not unexpected this far north. Winter conditions can vary tremendously from year to year. Winters have been known to be mild enough to produce \"brown Christmas\" conditions, where little or no snow may fall until after Christmas due to unusually mild early winter conditions.\n\nThe average January temperature is {{convert|\u221213.6|C|1}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|16.2|C|1}}. However, temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221252.2|C|0}} and as high as {{convert|35.6|C|0}}<ref name=\"CCN\"/> have been recorded; the extreme [[humidex]] and [[wind chill]] readings are {{convert|40.8|and|\u221263.0|C|0}}, respectively. The city receives {{convert|445|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, including {{convert|322|mm|abbr=on}} of rain and {{convert|154|cm|abbr=on}} of snow. Snowfall amounts, however, vary greatly from year to year. Being fairly close to the foothills of the [[Canadian Rockies]], it can get quite windy in Grande Prairie, especially in the spring and fall. [[Chinook wind|Chinooks]] may occur in and bring winter thaws to the Grande Prairie area.\nGrande Prairie has 314 days with measureable sunshine per year on average, and just above 2,200 hours of bright sunshine or about 46.1% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 31.2% in November to a high of 59.1% in July.<ref name = climate/>\n\nSummers can bring thunderstorms, although they are not as frequent nor as severe as those further south in [[Central Alberta]]. Rainfall can vary from year to year, but the Peace Region is noted for never{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} having experienced truly severe drought conditions more typical of [[Southern Alberta]] and neighbouring [[Saskatchewan]]. Tornadoes are rare but not unheard of in the Peace Region and, as noted above, a weak tornado actually struck the core of the city in 2004.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Grande Prairie Airport]],

It remains part of the local economy today. A variety of crops such as [[barley]], [[wheat]], [[canola]], and [[oat]]s are grown in the area. [[Livestock]] such as [[cattle]] and [[bison|buffalo (bison)]] are also raised in the area. Despite being north of the [[55th parallel north|55th parallel]], the climate is mild enough to allow for farming on a large scale to prosper. Longer daylight hours during the summer at this latitude aid in crop production. The Peace Country is the northernmost major farming region in [[North America]]. Land within the region is still being cleared for new farmland.\n\nAlthough some oil and gas drilling has been ongoing in the area since the 1950s, oil and gas exploration did not begin to occur on a large scale until the late 1970s. It was in the mid to late-1970s that the Elmworth gas field was discovered and developed, causing the city to grow rapidly until the oil boom ended in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofgp.com/index.aspx?page=667&from=mm |title=History of Grande Prairie |publisher= City of Grande Prairie |accessdate=2014-11-23}}</ref> Today Grande Prairie's location atop both the [[Montney Formation|Montney]] and [[Duvernay Formation|Duvernay]] geological formations have seen local extraction activities focused on [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[shale gas]].

[[International Paper]] (formerly [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Canada]]) [[Kraft process|kraft]] pulp mill, opened in 1972 by [[Procter & Gamble]], is one of Grande Prairie's largest employers. [[Canfor]] runs a sawmill and lumber yard operation on the west side of the city.

Two airlines, [[Air Canada Express]] and [[WestJet Encore]], offer service to the airport. The airport has seen growth in both passenger and aircraft traffic in recent years, and now serves just under a half a million passengers annually. The Grande Prairie Airport was originally developed in the 1930s as a grass only strip at its present site. In 1941 in support of the war effort, and the building of the Alaska Highway, the facility was expanded for utilization by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. In 1950 the airport came under the authority of the [[Government of Canada|Federal Government]] until February 1, 1997, at which time it was transferred to the City of Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Grande Prairie Airport|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information-101/history-2/|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe terminal, built in 1981, was renovated in 2009 making it twice its original size. In 2014, one of the two asphalt runways was extended from {{convert|6501|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8502|ft|abbr=on}} (the other is {{convert|6200|ft|abbr=on}}). Forthcoming expansions include an upgrade to the parking system. Currently the airport has no customs capabilities (although a temporary customs facility was set up for the 2010 Arctic Winter Games). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grandeprairieairport.com/airport-information/media-publications/most-new-airport-measures-wont-impact-grande-prairie/|title=March 8 2010 Most new airport measures won't impact Grande Prairie {{!}} Grande Prairie Airport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Swanberg Air]] formerly operated out of the airport until they ceased operations in 2011. They flew cargo, scheduled, and charter passenger services in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.\n\n====City public transit====\n[[Grande Prairie Transit]] is a small public transit system with modern buses and a route system integrated throughout the city.\n\n====Intercity bus====\n[[Greyhound Canada]] offered scheduled bus service from its Grande Prairie terminal to Edmonton and [[Dawson Creek]]. This service was terminated in October 2018. [[Pacific Western Transportation#Red Arrow Motorcoach|Red Arrow]] now connects Grande Prairie to Edmonton.\n\n====Highways and roads====\n[[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]] is the main highway through the city providing eventual connection to British Columbia to the west and Edmonton to the southeast. Highway 43 meets [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] a few kilometres north of the city at an intersection known locally as Four Mile Corner, then continues south into the city. It travels through the city via a northwest bypass and exits the city on the west end near the airport.\n\nThe stretch of [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] extending north from Grande Prairie to Four Mile Corner and west to the Alberta/BC border was renumbered to Highway 43 in the late 1990s to link with the rest of Highway 43 from Four Mile Corner to the [[Yellowhead Highway]] just west of Edmonton. This explains why newer maps no longer show that stretch west and a few&nbsp;km north of the city as Highway 2. The renumbering was also partly due to Highway 43 now being a part of the CANAMEX trade route and also due to it being widened to a four-lane divided highway for most of its length, the remaining two-lane undivided portion beginning 1.6 km east of the Highway 723 junction. [[Alberta Highway 40|Highway 40]] is the primary access road into Grande Prairie from the south.\n\nConstruction of a new [[Alberta Highway 43#Grande Prairie bypass|Highway 43X]] bypass will skirt the northwest side of the city from Four Mile Corner to Highway 43 just west of where the airport was begun in August 2007<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gov.ab.ca/acn/200708/21983B2544DD5-0D52-9623-579D3412290C6789.html |title= Construction starts on long-awaited Grande Prairie bypass|author= Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation |accessdate= 2007-09-04}}</ref> (\"Four Mile Corner\" is not an actual settlement - it is an intersection so-named because it is {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} north of the intersection of Clairmont Road (100th Street) and Richmond Avenue (100th Avenue)). The construction is in two phases, with the first phase under construction and the second currently in the design stage. The first phase extends west to Range Road 63 (116 Street within city limits), while the second phase runs west from Range Road 63 south to Highway 43 west of the airport. This future bypass is intended to replace the current one. The current bypass, which was built in the late 1960s, is no longer functioning well, due to high traffic volumes and new intersections. The rapid population growth of Grande Prairie is contributing to such a high increase in vehicle traffic that traffic jams are now relatively common during peak hours.\n\nGrande Prairie sees many vacationers heading to the [[Alaska Highway]] by road during the summer because Highway 43 leads towards [[Dawson Creek]], BC, which is the \"Mile 0\" of the Alaska Highway.\n\n====Rail====\nThe City of Grande Prairie has rail freight service provided by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Trackage runs south from Grande Prairie to [[Grande Cache]] and [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], where it joins CN's main transcontinental line. CN also operates local freight service out of Grande Prairie on former [[Northern Alberta Railways]] tracks - north to [[Sexsmith, Alberta|Sexsmith]] and [[Rycroft, Alberta|Rycroft]], and west to [[Beaverlodge]] and [[Hythe, Alberta|Hythe]].\n\n[[Savage Alberta Railway]], which operated from 1999 to 2006, was owned by [[North American RailNet]] and had its headquarters in the city prior to being purchased by CN.\n\n== Education ==\n=== Elementary and secondary schools ===\nFour school districts operate schools within Grande Prairie.<ref>{{cite web|url=

The formal process of doing this process is stated in article XIII of the Treaty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-ECAE8DB0-F591EC88/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm|title=The North Atlantic Treaty, Washington D.C. - 4 April 1949|date=2019-06-14|website=NATO}}</ref> This says that any country that wants to leave must send the United States (as the [[depositary]]) a \u201cnotice of denunciation,\u201d which the U.S. would then pass on to the other countries in the alliance. After a one-year waiting period, the country that wants to leave would be out.\n\nAs of 28 March 2020, no member state has rescinded their membership, although it has been mentioned by a few  countries. Notwithstanding, a number of former [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] of NATO members have never applied for membership subsequent to their becoming independent states.\n\n== Procedure ==\n{{wikisource|North_Atlantic_Treaty#|The Withdrawal Clause}}Article XIII of the North Atlantic Treaty, is the article that member state use on informing other members or parties that it wishes to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It states the following:<blockquote>''After the Treaty has been in force for twenty years, any Party may cease to be a Party one year after its notice of denunciation has been given to the Government of the United States of America, which will inform the Governments of the other Parties of the deposit of each notice of denunciation.''</blockquote>This means that after 20 years since the signing of the treaty which was in 1949, thus 1969, any member state that wishes to leave just has to inform the United States that it wants to leave, and then after a year it formally leaves.\n\n== Contemplated withdrawals ==\n=== France ===\nIn 1966 due to souring relations between Washington and Paris because of the refusal to integrate [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France's nuclear deterrent]] with other North Atlantic powers,  or accept any collective form of control over its armed forces, the French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] downgraded [[France]]'s membership in NATO and withdrew France from the U.S.-led military command to pursue an independent defense system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/11/AR2009031100547.html|title=After 43 Years, France to Rejoin NATO as Full Member|last=Cody|first=Edward|date=12 March 2009|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> However, the twenty-year rule prevented France from completely leaving NATO altogether.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_160672.htm|title=NATO - Declassified: France and NATO|website=NATO|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>  One consequence of this withdrawal was the movement of NATO's [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] from [[Rocquencourt]] (in France) to the city of [[Mons]] in Belgium.

By virtue of this, Algeria was part of NATO since its inception. In fact Article VI clearly states that an armed attack on Algeria would considered an attack on NATO.\n\nWhen Algeria gained its [[Algerian War|independence]] from France in 1962, its membership was ceased and the Article VI cause was removed. Like many [[Maghreb]] and [[Arab world|Arab countries]], it aligned itself with the Soviet Union which it ended for Algeria with the end of the Cold War. Since 2000, Algeria has participated in NATO\u2019s [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] forum.\n\n=== Malta ===\nOn the time of the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, the Mediterranean island of [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]] was a dependent territory in a form of a self-governing [[crown colony]] of the United Kingdom. Dependent territories like Malta had their international memberships of their mother country, so the island was part of NATO. In fact, the headquarters of the [[Allied Forces Mediterranean]] was based in the town of [[Floriana]] between 1952 and 1965.\n\nWhen [[Malta]] gained independence in 1964, the country did not apply to join NATO, due to the relations between NATO and the prime minister [[George Borg Olivier]] at the time, but nevertheless supported the alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00927A004600110002-0.pdf|title=The Outlook for an Independent Malta|last=|first=|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|year=1964|isbn=|location=Library - Reading Room|pages=|url-status=live}}</ref> This changed in 1971, when the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour]]\u2019s [[Dom Mintoff]] was elected as prime minister and stated that Malta is [[Neutral country|neutral]] in its foreign policy,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/17/archives/malta-confirms-break-with-nato-but-mintoff-says-members-can-buy.html|title=MALTA CONFIRMS BREAK WITH NATO|last=|first=|date=August 17, 1971|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref> a position which was later enacted into the country's [[Constitution of Malta|constitution]] in 1974.

However, it withdrew its membership a year later in 1996 by the newly elected Labour government. Maltese foreign policy changed notably in 2004, with the country joining the European Union and it re-joined the PfP program in 2008, pointing to a change in the island\u2019s [[Foreign relations of Malta|foreign relations]].\n\nMembership of NATO is not supported by any of the country\u2019s political parties including current governing Labour and the opposition [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalists]].

As so, [[British Cyprus|Cyprus]] was also a member of the NATO under the British crown.

By virtue of this, Algeria was part of NATO since its inception. In fact Article VI clearly states that an armed attack on Algeria would considered an attack on NATO.\n\nWhen Algeria gained its [[Algerian War|independence]] from France in 1962, its membership was ceased and the Article VI cause was removed.

However, there are instances of disputes among inhabitants, some of which continue for decades. Nuristan has suffered from its inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure.

Schumann's choice of scoring reflected developments in musical performance and instrumental design.\n\nBy midcentury, the [[string quartet]] was regarded as the most prestigious and important chamber music genre, while advances in the design of the [[piano]] had expanded its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann's piano quintet took full advantage of the expressive possibilities of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with passages in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. In Schumann's hands, the piano quintet became a genre \"suspended between private and public spheres\" alternating between \"quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements\"--well suited to an era when chamber music was increasingly being performed in large concert halls rather than at private gatherings in intimate spaces. <ref>John Daverio, 'Robert Schumann: Herald of a \"New Poetic Age.\"' (1997, Oxford), p. 256</ref>\n\nSchumann's quintet helped establish the piano quintet as a significant, and quintessentially Romantic, chamber music genre.<ref name=\"Stowell323-324\">Stowell, Robin ''The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet'', pp. 323\u2013324.</ref>.

The term also refers to the group of musicians that plays a piano quintet. The genre particularly flourished during the nineteenth century.\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, most piano quintets were scored for piano, [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]]. Following the success of [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major, Op. 44]] in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet, composers increasingly adopted Schumann's instrumentation, and it was this form of the piano quintet that dominated during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.\n\nAmong the best known and most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann's, are those by [[Trout quintet|Franz Schubert]], [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Johannes Brahms]], [[Piano_Quintet_(Franck)|C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Dmitri Shostakovich]].<ref name=\"Stowell324\">{{cite book|author1=Robin Stowell|author2=Jonathan Cross|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC&pg=PA324|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0|page=324}}</ref>\n\n==The piano quintet before 1842==\nWhile the related chamber music genres of the [[piano trio]] and [[piano quartet]] were established in the eighteenth century by [[Mozart]] and others, the piano quintet did not come into its own as a genre until the nineteenth century.<ref>The quintets for piano, [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[bassoon]] composed by [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Mozart)|Mozart]] and [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Beethoven)|Beethoven]] are usually described as \"quintets for piano and winds\" so as to distinguish them from compositions for piano and four strings.</ref> Its roots extend into the late [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], when [[piano concertos]] were sometimes transcribed for [[piano]] with [[string quartet]] accompaniment.<ref name=\"Harvard\">{{cite book|author=Willi Apel|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&pg=PA699|date=28 November 2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01163-2|page=699}}</ref> \n\nAlthough [[Luigi Boccherini]] composed quintets for piano and string quartet, before 1842 it was more common for the piano to be joined by violin, viola, cello and double bass.  Perhaps the best known quintets for this combination of instruments are [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Trout Quintet|\"Trout\" Quintet]] in A major (1819) and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]'s Piano Quintet in E-flat minor, Op.87 (1802). Other piano quintets using this instrumentation were composed by [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]] (1799), [[Ferdinand Ries]] (1817),  [[Johann Baptist Cramer]] (1825, 1832), [[Henri Jean Rigel]] (1826), [[Johann Peter Pixis]] (ca.1827), [[Franz Limmer]] (1832), [[Louise Farrenc]] (1839, 1840), and [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]] (1846, 1848, 1849).<ref name=\"Smallman3\">{{cite book|last=Smallman|first=Basil|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA3|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"Smallman26\">{{cite book|author=Basil Smallman|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA26|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=26}}</ref>\n\nMozart (in 1784) and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (in 1796) each composed a quintet for piano and winds, scored for piano, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, that are sometimes referred to as piano quintets.\n\n==Schumann and the Romantic piano quintet==\n[[File:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Schumann]], lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839, three years before the composition of his piano quintet.]]\nIn the middle of the 19th century, [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major]], Op. 44 (1842), composed for piano with string quartet, helped make that combination of instruments the default model for the piano quintet.  Schumann's choice of scoring reflected developments in musical performance and instrumental design.\n\nBy midcentury, the [[string quartet]] was regarded as the most prestigious and important chamber music genre, while advances in the design of the [[piano]] had expanded its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann's piano quintet took full advantage of the expressive possibilities of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with passages in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. In Schumann's hands, the piano quintet became a genre \"suspended between private and public spheres\" alternating between \"quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements\"--well suited to an era when chamber music was increasingly being performed in large concert halls rather than at private gatherings in intimate spaces. <ref>John Daverio, 'Robert Schumann: Herald of a \"New Poetic Age.\"' (1997, Oxford), p. 256</ref>\n\nSchumann's quintet helped establish the piano quintet as a significant, and quintessentially Romantic, chamber music genre.<ref name=\"Stowell323-324\">Stowell, Robin ''The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet'', pp. 323\u2013324.</ref>.

Though he started off with supporting roles in films such as ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', and ''[[Nurse Betty]]'', he went on to star in films like ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]'', and  ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]''.

The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an \"edge\" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''\"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!\"'' During one segment Rock asked, \"Who is this guy?\" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: \"If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!\"). Subsequently, an angry [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, \"In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.\" (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.)

Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] (an [[Italian Americans|Italian]]-ethnic neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has criticized Rock both explicitly\u2014for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] routine\u2014and implicitly, for use of the word \"[[nigger]].\"<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. \"Bill Cosby to Blacks,\" July 2, 2004. \"When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car\u2014those children hear that... That's all [[minstrel show]] stuff. I am tired of it.\"</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects [[Caucasian race|whites]] to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This''; Hyperion, 1997, p. 16.</ref> Often the subject of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], when asked about [[paparazzi]] and the other negative aspects of [[Celebrity|fame]], Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: \"You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Everybody Loves Chris |url=http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200018/http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007  }}</ref>\n\nAt the London [[Live Earth concert, London|Live Earth]] concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the [[BBC]], before introducing the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], Rock called the crowd \"[[motherfucker]]s\" and said \"shit\", after a brief pause he said he was joking.

Some of his 2010s film appearances include ''[[Death at a Funeral (2010 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'', ''[[Grown Ups (2010 film)|Grown Ups]]'', and ''[[2 Days in New York]]''.\n\nRock has also increasingly worked behind the camera, both as a writer and director of ''[[Head of State (2003 film)|Head of State]]'' and ''[[I Think I Love My Wife]]'' (both in which he played the lead role). Additionally, he has done voice work in the ''[[Madagascar (franchise)|Madagascar]]'' animated film franchise, voicing the eccentric zebra [[List of Madagascar characters#Marty|Marty]].\n\nFollowing the release of his first documentary, 2009's ''[[Good Hair (film)|Good Hair]]'', Rock is working on a documentary about debt called ''Credit Is the Devil''.<ref>{{cite news| last = Furey | first = Phil | title = Chris Rock sets comic sights on devilish credit\n|work = Reuters|date = April 16, 2010| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63F5OA20100417|accessdate =May 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nin 2014, Rock wrote, directed and starred in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Top Five]]'', which critics have drawn comparison to [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Stardust Memories]].''

The decision to have Rock host the awards was seen by some as a chance to bring an \"edge\" to the ceremony, and to make it more relevant or appealing to younger audiences. Jokingly, Rock opened by saying ''\"Welcome to the 77th and LAST Academy Awards!\"'' During one segment Rock asked, \"Who is this guy?\" in reference to actor [[Jude Law]] seemingly appearing in every movie Rock had seen that year and implied Law was a low-rent [[Tom Cruise]] (he made a joke about filmmakers rushing production when unable to get the actors they want: \"If you want Tom Cruise and all you can get is Jude Law, wait [to make the film]!\"). Subsequently, an angry [[Sean Penn]] took the stage to present and said, \"In answer to our host's question, Jude Law is one of our finest young actors.\" (At the time, Penn and Law were shooting ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]''.) Law was not the only actor that Rock [[Roast (comedy)|roasted]] that evening, however\u2014he turned the joke on himself at one point, saying, \"If you want [[Denzel Washington|Denzel]] [Washington] and all you can get is me, wait!\" Older Oscar officials were reportedly displeased with Rock's performance, which did not elevate ratings for the ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113094616/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/mar/02/awardsandprizes.oscars2005|url-status=dead|title=Chris Rock effect fails to boost Oscars|date=March 2, 2005|archivedate=November 13, 2012|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Rock was also criticized for referring to the Oscars as \"idiotic\", and asserting that heterosexual men do not watch them, in an interview prior to Oscar night.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/hey-chris-rock-shut-bleep-wbna6849862|title=Hey, Chris Rock: Shut the [bleep] up|date=February 3, 2005|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923063025/http://www.smh.com.au/news/Oscars-2005/Chris-Rock-Oscars-host-slams-Oscars/2005/02/16/1108500124826.html|url-status=dead|title=\"Chris Rock, Oscars host, slams Oscars\"; ''Sydney Morning Herald''/Reuters; February 16, 2005|archivedate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 2015 the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] announced Rock would host the [[88th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34591581|title=Chris Rock to host 2016 Oscars|work=BBC News}}</ref> When the subsequent acting nominations turned out to include no racial minorities, Rock was called upon to join a boycott of the ceremony.

Though not strictly autobiographical, much of his comic standpoint seems rooted in his teenage experience; his strict parents, concerned about the inadequacies of the local school system, arranged to have the adolescent Rock bused to a nearly all-white high school in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] (an [[Italian Americans|Italian]]-ethnic neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] known at the time for poor race relations). In his memoir ''Rock This'', he recalls, \"My parents assumed I'd get a better education in a better neighborhood. What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood. And a whole bunch of ass-whippings.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This'' Hyperion, 1997, p. 46. \"I got bused from Bed-Stuy to a white school in a poor white neighborhood: Gerretson Beach, Brooklyn... What I actually got was a worse education in a worse neighborhood...\"</ref>\n\nThe comedian has also expressed discomfort with the notion that success in stand-up comedy\u2014or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry\u2014should oblige him to serve as a [[role model]]. In this position, he finds himself feuding with one of his comic idols, [[Bill Cosby]]. Cosby has criticized Rock both explicitly\u2014for his [[Niggas vs. Black People]] routine\u2014and implicitly, for use of the word \"[[nigger]].\"<ref>Morano, Marc. CNSNews. \"Bill Cosby to Blacks,\" July 2, 2004. \"When you put on a record, and that record is yelling 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' and cursing all over the thing and you got your little six-year-old and seven-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car\u2014those children hear that... That's all [[minstrel show]] stuff. I am tired of it.\"</ref> Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 ''Roll With The New'' show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: \"Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling [[Jerry Seinfeld]] he's a good role model. Because everyone expects [[Caucasian race|whites]] to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much.\"<ref>Rock, Chris. ''Rock This''; Hyperion, 1997, p. 16.</ref> Often the subject of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]], when asked about [[paparazzi]] and the other negative aspects of [[Celebrity|fame]], Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: \"You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Everybody Loves Chris |url=http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200018/http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647576/everybody_loves_chris.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAt the London [[Live Earth concert, London|Live Earth]] concert on July 7, 2007, which was broadcast live on the [[BBC]], before introducing the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], Rock called the crowd \"[[motherfucker]]s\" and said \"shit\", after a brief pause he said he was joking.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.
