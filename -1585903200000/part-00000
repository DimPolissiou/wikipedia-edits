{"title_page": "Shotgun wedding", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2017}}\n{{other uses}}\nA '''shotgun wedding''' is a [[wedding]] that is arranged to avoid embarrassment due to premarital sex possibly leading to an [[unintended pregnancy]], rather than out of the desire of the participants<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shotgun-wedding|title=the definition of shotgun wedding|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>. The phrase is a primarily American [[colloquialism]], termed as such based on a stereotypical scenario where the father of the pregnant bride-to-be threatens the reluctant groom with a [[shotgun]] to ensure that he follows through with the wedding.\n\n== Rationale ==\nOne purpose of such a wedding can be to get recourse from the man for the act of [[impregnation]]; another reason is trying to ensure that the child is raised by both parents.

The Skyraider had a remarkably long and successful career; it became a [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-powered, [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]]-driven anachronism in the [[Jet Age|jet age]], and was nicknamed \"Spad\", after the [[SPAD S.XIII|French World War I fighter]].<ref>Burgess and Rausa 2009, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIt was operated by the [[United States Navy]] (USN), the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), and also saw service with the British [[Royal Navy]], the [[French Air Force]], the [[South Vietnam Air Force|Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF), and others. It remained in U.S. service until the early 1970s.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe piston-engined Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]], single-seat, long-range, high performance [[dive bomber|dive]]/[[torpedo bomber]], to follow-on from earlier types such as the [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] and [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].<ref>Parker, Dana T.

The XBT2D-1 made its first flight on 18 March 1945 and in April 1945, the USN began evaluation of the aircraft at the [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|Naval Air Test Center]] (NATC).<ref name=\"Swan Navy p176\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 176.</ref> In December 1946, after a designation change to '''AD-1''', delivery of the first production aircraft to a fleet squadron was made to VA-19A.<ref name=\"Swan Navy p177\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe AD-1 was built at Douglas' [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]] plant in Southern California. In his memoir ''The Lonely Sky'', test pilot [[Bill Bridgeman]] describes the routine yet sometimes hazardous work of certifying AD-1s fresh off the assembly line at a rate of two aircraft per day for delivery to the U.S. Navy in 1949 and 1950.<ref>Bridgeman and Hazard 1955, pp. 38\u201340.</ref>\n\n[[File:Douglas XBT2D-1 Skyraider prototype NACA.jpg|thumb|left|A Douglas XBT2D-1 Skyraider prototype]]\nThe low-wing monoplane design started with a [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone]] [[radial engine]] which was later upgraded several times. Its distinctive feature was large straight wings with seven [[hardpoint|hard points]] apiece. The Skyraider possessed excellent low-speed maneuverability and carried a large amount of [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] over a considerable combat radius. Further, it had a long loiter time for its size, compared to much heavier subsonic or supersonic jets. The aircraft was optimized for the ground-attack mission and was armored against ground fire in key locations, unlike faster fighters adapted to carry bombs, such as the [[Vought F4U Corsair]] or [[North American P-51 Mustang]], which were retired by U.S. forces before the 1960s.\n\nShortly after Heinemann began designing the XBT2D-1, a study was issued that showed for every {{cvt|100|lb}} of weight reduction, the takeoff run was decreased by {{cvt|8|ft}}, the combat radius increased by {{cvt|22|mi}} and the rate-of-climb increased by {{cvt|18|ft/min|m/s}}. Heinemann immediately had his design engineers begin a program for finding weight-saving on the XBT2D-1 design, no matter how small. Simplifying the fuel system resulted in a reduction of {{cvt|270|lb}}; {{cvt|200|lb}} by eliminating an internal bomb bay and hanging external stores from the wings or fuselage; {{cvt|70|lb}} by using a fuselage dive brake; and {{cvt|100|lb}} by using an older tailwheel design. In the end, Heinemann and his design engineers achieved more than {{cvt|1800|lb}} of weight reduction on the original XBT2D-1 design.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Headaches of a Jet Designer.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1953, pp. 81\u201385, 248.</ref>\n\nThe Navy AD series was initially painted in ANA 623 Glossy Sea Blue, but during the 1950s following the Korean War, the color scheme was changed to light gull grey ([http://www.fed-std-595.com/FS-595-Paint-Spec.html Fed Std 595 26440]) and white (Fed Std 595 27875). Initially using the gray and white Navy scheme, by 1967 the USAF began to paint its Skyraiders in a camouflaged pattern using two shades of green, and one of tan.\n[[File:AE-1 Skyraider - Chino Airshow (cropped).jpg|thumb|A-1E Skyraider in [[South Vietnam Air Force|RVNAF]] colors during an [[Air show]]]]\n\nUsed by the US Navy over Korea and Vietnam, the A-1 was a primary close air support aircraft for the USAF and RVNAF during the Vietnam War. The A-1 was famous for being able to take hits and keep flying thanks to armor plating around the cockpit area for pilot protection. It was replaced beginning in the mid-1960s by the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] as the Navy's primary medium-attack plane in [[Aircraft carrier#Supercarrier|supercarrier]]-based air wings; however Skyraiders continued to operate from the smaller [[Essex-class aircraft carrier]]s.\n\nThe Skyraider went through seven versions, starting with the '''AD-1''', then '''AD-2''' and '''AD-3''' with various minor improvements, then the '''AD-4''' with a more powerful '''R-3350-26WA''' engine. The '''AD-5''' was significantly widened, allowing two crew to sit side-by-side (this was not the first multiple-crew variant, the '''AD-1Q''' being a two-seater and the '''AD-3N''' a three-seater); it also came in a four-seat night-attack version, the '''AD-5N'''. The '''AD-6''' was an improved AD-4B with improved low-level bombing equipment, and the final production version '''AD-7''' was upgraded to a '''R-3350-26WB''' engine.\n\nFor service in Vietnam, USAF Skyraiders were fitted with the Stanley Yankee extraction system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/yankee.htm|title=The Ejection Site: Stanley YANKEE Extraction System|author=|date=|website=www.ejectionsite.com|access-date=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020110065229/http://www.ejectionsite.com/yankee.htm|archive-date=10 January 2002|df=}}</ref> which acted in a similar manner to an ejection seat, though with twin rockets extracting pilot from the cockpit.\n\nIn addition to serving during Korea and Vietnam as an attack aircraft, the Skyraider was modified to serve as a carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft, replacing the [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM-3W Avenger]]. It fulfilled this function in the USN and [[Royal Navy]], being replaced by the [[Grumman E-1 Tracer]] and [[Fairey Gannet]], respectively, in those services.<ref name=\"avhist\"/>\n\nSkyraider production ended in 1957 with a total of 3,180 having been built. In 1962, the existing Skyraiders were redesignated '''A-1D''' through '''A-1J''' and later used by both the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in the Vietnam War.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:AD Skyraider VA-195 USS Princeton.jpg|thumb|AD-4 Skyraider taking off from {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}} during the Korean War]]\nThe Skyraider was produced too late to take part in World War II, but became the backbone of United States Navy aircraft carrier and United States Marine Corps strike aircraft sorties in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), with the first ADs going into action from {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}} with [[VA-55 (U.S. Navy)|VA-55]] on 3 July 1950.<ref>Mersky 1983, p. 144.</ref> Its weapons load and 10-hour flying time far surpassed the jets that were available at the time.<ref name=\"avhist\">Johnson, E.R. \"Able Dog.\" ''Aviation History'', September 2008.</ref> On 2 May 1951, Skyraiders made the only [[aerial torpedo]] attack of the war, hitting the [[Hwacheon Dam]], then controlled by North Korea.<ref>Faltum 1996, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>\n\nOn 16 June 1953, a USMC AD-4 from [[VMC-1]] piloted by [[Major]] George H.

Most operational losses were due to the tremendous power of the AD. ADs that were \"waved-off\" during carrier recovery operations were prone to performing a fatal torque roll into the sea or the deck of the aircraft carrier if the pilot mistakenly gave the AD too much throttle. The torque of the engine was so great that it would cause the aircraft to rotate about the propeller and slam into the sea or the carrier.\n\n===Cathay Pacific VR-HEU incident===\nOn 26 July 1954, two Douglas Skyraiders from the aircraft carriers {{USS|Philippine Sea|CV-47|6}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}} shot down two [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] Lavochkin fighters<!--The Lavochkin La-7 was a WW2 fighter never used by China, but they used the similar La-9, which has been misidentified in the source.

The AD-4N/NAs were initially acquired in 1956 to replace aging [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s in Algeria.<ref name=\"Francillon Douglas p403\">Francillon 1979, p. 403.</ref>\n\nThe Skyraiders were first ordered in 1956 and the first was handed over to the French Air Force on 6 February 1958 after being overhauled and fitted with some French equipment by Sud-Aviation. The aircraft were used until the end of the [[Algerian war]]. The aircraft were used by the 20e ''Escadre de Chasse'' (EC 1/20 \"Aures Nementcha\", EC 2/20 \"Ouarsenis\" and EC 3/20 \"Oranie\") and EC 21 in the close air support role armed with rockets, bombs and [[napalm]].\n\nThe Skyraiders had only a short career in Algeria, but they nonetheless proved to be the most successful of all the ad hoc COIN aircraft deployed by the French. The Skyraider remained in limited French service until the 1970s.<ref name=\"Francillon Douglas p403\"/> They were heavily involved in the civil war in Chad, at first with the ''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'', and later with a nominally independent [[Chadian Air Force]] staffed by French mercenaries. The aircraft also operated under the French flag in Djibouti and on the island of Madagascar. When France at last relinquished the Skyraiders it passed the survivors on to client states, including Gabon, [[Chad]], [[Cambodia]] and the [[Central African Republic]].<ref name=\"Francillon Douglas p404-4\">Francillon 1979, pp. 403\u2013404.</ref> (Several aircraft from Gabon and Chad have been recovered recently by French warbird enthusiasts and entered on the French civil register).\n\nThe French frequently used the aft station to carry maintenance personnel, spare parts and supplies to forward bases. In Chad they even used the aft station for a \"bombardier\" and his \"special stores\" \u2013 empty beer bottles \u2013 as these were considered as [[non-lethal weapon]]s, thus not breaking the government-imposed rules of engagement, during operations against Libyan-supported rebels in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Douglas XBT2D-1 Skyraider on the ground, circa 1945.jpg|thumb|The XBT2D-1 in 1945]]\n[[File:Douglas AD-1Q Skyraider VC-35.jpg|thumb|VC-35 AD-1Q in the late 1940s]]\n[[File:AD-3Q AD-4N AD-5N VC-33 NAS Atlantic City NAN6-55.jpg|thumb|[[VAQ-33|VC-33]] AD-3Q, AD-4N, and AD-5N in 1955]]\n[[File:Douglas AD-4W Skyraider of VC-12 landing aboard USS Leyte (CVA-32), in 1952.jpg|thumb|AD-4W AEW aircraft landing on {{USS|Leyte|CV-32|6}}]]\n[[File:AD-5 Skyraider VMA-331 1950s.jpg|thumb|[[VMA-331]] AD-5 in flight]]\n[[File:EA-1F VAW-13 1966.jpg|thumb|EA-1F (AD-5Q) ECM aircraft, BuNo 135010, of [[Carrier Air Wing Nine|CVW-9]] in 1966]]\n[[File:AD-5W on deck USS Kearsarge 1957-58.jpg|thumb|VAW-11 AD-5W aboard {{USS|Kearsarge|CV-33|6}}, 1958]]\n[[File:AD-6 Skyraider.jpg|thumb|AD-6s from [[VA-42 (U.S. Navy)|VA-42]]]]\n\n;XBT2D-1: Single-seat dive-bomber, torpedo-bomber prototype for the U.S. Navy.\n;XBT2D-1N: Three-seat night attack prototypes; only three aircraft built.\n;XBT2D-1P: Photographic reconnaissance prototype; only one built.\n;XBT2D-1Q: Two-seat electronics countermeasures prototype; one aircraft only.\n;BT2D-2 (XAD-2): Upgraded attack aircraft; one prototype only.\n;AD-1: The first production model; 242 built.\n;AD-1Q: Two-seat electronic countermeasures version of the AD-1; 35 built.\n;AD-1U: AD-1 with radar countermeasures and tow target equipment, no armament and no [[Water injection (engines)|water injection]] equipment.\n;XAD-1W: Three-seat airborne early warning prototype.

The Skyraider had a remarkably long and successful career; it became a [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-powered, [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]]-driven anachronism in the [[Jet Age|jet age]], and was nicknamed \"Spad\", after the [[SPAD S.XIII|French World War I fighter]].<ref>Burgess and Rausa 2009, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIt was operated by the [[United States Navy]] (USN), the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), and the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), and also saw service with the British [[Royal Navy]], the [[French Air Force]], the [[South Vietnam Air Force|Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF), and others. It remained in U.S. service until the early 1970s.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe piston-engined Skyraider was designed during World War II to meet United States Navy requirements for a [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]], single-seat, long-range, high performance [[dive bomber|dive]]/[[torpedo bomber]], to follow-on from earlier types such as the [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] and [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].<ref>Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 33, Cypress, Calif., 2013. {{ISBN|978-0989790604}}.</ref> Designed by [[Ed Heinemann]] of the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], prototypes were ordered on 6 July 1944 as the '''XBT2D-1'''. The XBT2D-1 made its first flight on 18 March 1945 and in April 1945, the USN began evaluation of the aircraft at the [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|Naval Air Test Center]] (NATC).<ref name=\"Swan Navy p176\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 176.</ref> In December 1946, after a designation change to '''AD-1''', delivery of the first production aircraft to a fleet squadron was made to VA-19A.<ref name=\"Swan Navy p177\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe AD-1 was built at Douglas' [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]] plant in Southern California. In his memoir ''The Lonely Sky'', test pilot [[Bill Bridgeman]] describes the routine yet sometimes hazardous work of certifying AD-1s fresh off the assembly line at a rate of two aircraft per day for delivery to the U.S. Navy in 1949 and 1950.<ref>Bridgeman and Hazard 1955, pp. 38\u201340.</ref>\n\n[[File:Douglas XBT2D-1 Skyraider prototype NACA.jpg|thumb|left|A Douglas XBT2D-1 Skyraider prototype]]\nThe low-wing monoplane design started with a [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone]] [[radial engine]] which was later upgraded several times. Its distinctive feature was large straight wings with seven [[hardpoint|hard points]] apiece. The Skyraider possessed excellent low-speed maneuverability and carried a large amount of [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] over a considerable combat radius. Further, it had a long loiter time for its size, compared to much heavier subsonic or supersonic jets. The aircraft was optimized for the ground-attack mission and was armored against ground fire in key locations, unlike faster fighters adapted to carry bombs, such as the [[Vought F4U Corsair]] or [[North American P-51 Mustang]], which were retired by U.S. forces before the 1960s.\n\nShortly after Heinemann began designing the XBT2D-1, a study was issued that showed for every {{cvt|100|lb}} of weight reduction, the takeoff run was decreased by {{cvt|8|ft}}, the combat radius increased by {{cvt|22|mi}} and the rate-of-climb increased by {{cvt|18|ft/min|m/s}}. Heinemann immediately had his design engineers begin a program for finding weight-saving on the XBT2D-1 design, no matter how small. Simplifying the fuel system resulted in a reduction of {{cvt|270|lb}}; {{cvt|200|lb}} by eliminating an internal bomb bay and hanging external stores from the wings or fuselage; {{cvt|70|lb}} by using a fuselage dive brake; and {{cvt|100|lb}} by using an older tailwheel design. In the end, Heinemann and his design engineers achieved more than {{cvt|1800|lb}} of weight reduction on the original XBT2D-1 design.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true \"Headaches of a Jet Designer.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1953, pp. 81\u201385, 248.</ref>\n\nThe Navy AD series was initially painted in ANA 623 Glossy Sea Blue, but during the 1950s following the Korean War, the color scheme was changed to light gull grey ([http://www.fed-std-595.com/FS-595-Paint-Spec.html Fed Std 595 26440]) and white (Fed Std 595 27875). Initially using the gray and white Navy scheme, by 1967 the USAF began to paint its Skyraiders in a camouflaged pattern using two shades of green, and one of tan.\n[[File:AE-1 Skyraider - Chino Airshow (cropped).jpg|thumb|A-1E Skyraider in [[South Vietnam Air Force|RVNAF]] colors during an [[Air show]]]]\n\nUsed by the US Navy over Korea and Vietnam, the A-1 was a primary close air support aircraft for the USAF and RVNAF during the Vietnam War. The A-1 was famous for being able to take hits and keep flying thanks to armor plating around the cockpit area for pilot protection. It was replaced beginning in the mid-1960s by the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] as the Navy's primary medium-attack plane in [[Aircraft carrier#Supercarrier|supercarrier]]-based air wings; however Skyraiders continued to operate from the smaller [[Essex-class aircraft carrier]]s.\n\nThe Skyraider went through seven versions, starting with the '''AD-1''', then '''AD-2''' and '''AD-3''' with various minor improvements, then the '''AD-4''' with a more powerful '''R-3350-26WA''' engine. The '''AD-5''' was significantly widened, allowing two crew to sit side-by-side (this was not the first multiple-crew variant, the '''AD-1Q''' being a two-seater and the '''AD-3N''' a three-seater); it also came in a four-seat night-attack version, the '''AD-5N'''. The '''AD-6''' was an improved AD-4B with improved low-level bombing equipment, and the final production version '''AD-7''' was upgraded to a '''R-3350-26WB''' engine.\n\nFor service in Vietnam, USAF Skyraiders were fitted with the Stanley Yankee extraction system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/yankee.htm|title=The Ejection Site: Stanley YANKEE Extraction System|author=|date=|website=www.ejectionsite.com|access-date=27 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020110065229/http://www.ejectionsite.com/yankee.htm|archive-date=10 January 2002|df=}}</ref> which acted in a similar manner to an ejection seat, though with twin rockets extracting pilot from the cockpit.\n\nIn addition to serving during Korea and Vietnam as an attack aircraft, the Skyraider was modified to serve as a carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft, replacing the [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM-3W Avenger]]. It fulfilled this function in the USN and [[Royal Navy]], being replaced by the [[Grumman E-1 Tracer]] and [[Fairey Gannet]], respectively, in those services.<ref name=\"avhist\"/>\n\nSkyraider production ended in 1957 with a total of 3,180 having been built. In 1962, the existing Skyraiders were redesignated '''A-1D''' through '''A-1J''' and later used by both the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in the Vietnam War.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:AD Skyraider VA-195 USS Princeton.jpg|thumb|AD-4 Skyraider taking off from {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}} during the Korean War]]\nThe Skyraider was produced too late to take part in World War II, but became the backbone of United States Navy aircraft carrier and United States Marine Corps strike aircraft sorties in the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), with the first ADs going into action from {{USS|Valley Forge|CV-45|2}} with [[VA-55 (U.S. Navy)|VA-55]] on 3 July 1950.<ref>Mersky 1983, p. 144.</ref> Its weapons load and 10-hour flying time far surpassed the jets that were available at the time.<ref name=\"avhist\">Johnson, E.R. \"Able Dog.\" ''Aviation History'', September 2008.</ref> On 2 May 1951, Skyraiders made the only [[aerial torpedo]] attack of the war, hitting the [[Hwacheon Dam]], then controlled by North Korea.<ref>Faltum 1996, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>\n\nOn 16 June 1953, a USMC AD-4 from [[VMC-1]] piloted by [[Major]] George H.

Working as an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[computer scientist]] at the same time, he was one of the very few players who achieved distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive chess. He was also a pioneer of [[computer chess]].\n\nBotvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but the evidence is unclear and some suggest{{who|date=May 2014}} he resisted attempts by Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.\n\nBotvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess, making a significant contribution to the design of the [[World Chess Championship]] system after World War II and becoming a leading member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to dominate top-class chess during that time.

At about the same time, Mikhail started reading newspapers, and became a committed [[Communist]].<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nIn autumn 1923, at the age of twelve,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> Mikhail Botvinnik was taught chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and instantly fell in love with the game.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother's friends, and concluded that for him it was better to think out \"concrete concepts\" and then derive general principles from these \u2013 and went on to beat his brother's friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school's championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the [[Petrograd]] Chess Assembly \u2013 to which the Assembly's President turned a blind eye.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, [[Nikolai Krylenko]], a devoted chess player and leading member of the [[Soviet law|Soviet legal system]] who later organized [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trials]], began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city's Palace of Labor.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nTo test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Krylenko organized the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]]. On a rest day during the event,<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />  world champion [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] gave a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in [[Leningrad]]. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won their game.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> In 1926, he reached the final stage of the Leningrad championship. Later that year, he was selected for Leningrad's team in a match against [[Stockholm]], held in Sweden, and scored +1=1 against the future [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[G\u00f6sta Stoltz]]. On his return, he entertained his schoolmates with a vivid account of the rough sea journey back to Russia. Botvinnik was commissioned to annotate two games from the match, and the fact that his analyses were to be published made him aware of the need for objectivity. In December 1926, he became a candidate member of his school's [[Komsomol]] branch. Around this time his mother became concerned about his poor physique, and as a result he started a program of daily exercise, which he maintained for most of his life.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\n[[File:Botvinnik (1927).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Botvinnik in 1927]]\nWhen Botvinnik finished the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=16\u201322|chapter=The Polytechnic}}</ref> While waiting, he qualified for his first [[USSR Chess Championship|USSR Championship]] final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]] and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the ''Proletstud'', which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\" /> In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the ''Proletstud'', secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where he was one of only four students who entered straight from school.

He remained involved with competitive chess, appearing in several highly rated tournaments and continuing to produce memorable games.\n\nHe retired from competitive play in 1970, aged 59, preferring instead to occupy himself with the development of [[computer chess]] programs and to assist with the training of younger Soviet players, earning him the nickname of \"Patriarch of the Soviet Chess School\" (see below).\n\nBotvinnik's autobiography, ''K Dostizheniyu Tseli'', was published in Russian in 1978, and in English translation as ''Achieving the Aim'' ({{ISBN|0-08-024120-4}}) in 1981. A staunch Communist, he was noticeably shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union and lost some of his standing in Russian chess during the [[Boris Yeltsin]] era.\n\nIn the 1980s Botvinnik proposed a computer program to manage the Soviet economy. However, his proposals did not receive significant attention from the Soviet government.\n\nDuring the last few years of his life he personally financed his economic computer project that he hoped would be used to manage the Russian economy. He kept actively working on the program until his death and financing the work from the money he made for the lectures and seminars he attended, despite prominent health problems.\n\nBotvinnik died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in May 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scr-kuppenheim.de/extra/sosonko.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719083028/http://www.scr-kuppenheim.de/extra/sosonko.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref> According to his daughter, Botvinnik remained active until the last few months of his life, and continued to go to work until March 1995 despite blindness in one of his eyes (and extremely poor vision in the other).\n\n== Political controversies ==\nThe Soviet Union regarded chess as a symbol of Communist superiority, and hence the Soviet chess world was extremely politicized.<ref name=\"Kingston2001BotvinnikKeresRevisited\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles165.pdf\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case Revisited: A Further Survey of the Evidence\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}}</ref><ref name=\"MouleNye2006DidSovietsCollude\">{{cite web \n |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jlbroz/PElunch/sovietchesscartel.pdf \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nXCdC5r8?url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jlbroz/PElunch/sovietchesscartel.pdf \n |archivedate=2010-02-14 \n |title=Did the Soviets Collude?: A Statistical Analysis of Championship Chess 1940\u201364 \n |author1=Moul, C. \n |author2=Nye, J.V.C. \n |publisher=Washington University in St. Louis \n |year=2006 \n |url-status=dead \n }}</ref> As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, everything he said or did (or did not say or do) had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.\n\n[[David Bronstein]] wrote that [[Boris Verlinsky]] had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (as distinct from the then-nonexistent [[FIDE]] grandmaster title).<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nBotvinnik wrote that before the last round of the 1935 Moscow tournament, Soviet Commissar of Justice [[Nikolai Krylenko]], who was also in charge of Soviet chess, proposed that Ilya Rabinovich should deliberately lose to Botvinnik, to ensure that Botvinnik took first place.

Alekhine was of noble background, with a father who was a member of the Fourth Duma. He was one of the top players in the world at the time of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], won the first official Soviet Championship in 1920, then fled Moscow for good shortly afterwards in 1921. This was seen as a shameful repudiation of his homeland, and few crimes were more serious in Soviet eyes at that time. Botvinnik's [[Nottingham]] 1936 victory, the first by a Soviet master outside his homeland, earned him the government's favour.\n\nThe head of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]] in the early-to-mid 1930s was Nikolai Krylenko, also the State prosecutor who had run the infamous [[Show Trials]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s. When Botvinnik lost for the third time (without winning) to [[Fedor Bogatyrchuk]], Krylenko told Bogatyrchuk, \"You will never beat Botvinnik again.\" That proved to be true as the two never played each other again.\n\n[[Boris Verlinsky]] had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (not the same thing as the [[FIDE]] Grandmaster title).<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nBotvinnik did not win the [[AVRO tournament]] of 1938, placing third behind Keres and Fine, yet soon afterwards began angling through the Soviet government channels for a match with Alekhine for the World Championship. Botvinnik did win the 1939 Soviet Championship with a dramatic last-round victory over runner-up [[Alexander Kotov]]. But he played relatively poorly in the very strong 1940 Soviet Championship, finishing in a tie for 5th\u20136th places, with 11.5/19, two full points behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. How would it look for him to be trying for a world title match, yet doing that poorly in his own national championship? With World War II underway by this time, and the strong possibility of little or no chess for some time in the future, Botvinnik seems to have prevailed upon the Soviet chess leadership to hold another tournament \"in order to clarify the situation\".<ref>Egon Varnusz: \"Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games\" (London, Cadogan 1994, translated by Andras Barabas, ISBN 1-85744-064-1), page xi.</ref> This wound up being the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, which featured the top six finishers from the 1940 event, playing each other four times. Botvinnik won this tournament convincingly, to reclaim his prominence.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II with the German invasion in 1941. From 1941 to 1943, Botvinnik gave all of his time to his work as an engineer, visiting and testing power stations, as well as repairing insulations. By the beginning of 1943, he was able to take up chess again on a limited basis, studying and playing two days per week. He won the strong [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] 1943 tournament, and played hors concours in the 1943 Moscow Championship, winning with 13.5/16.\n\nImmediately following the end of the 1946 Groningen tournament, with Alekhine having died earlier that year, and with no set system for choosing the new world champion, Botvinnik personally invited Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Max Euwe, Vasily Smyslov, and Paul Keres to join him in a tournament to decide the new world champion.<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nFIDE, the World Chess Federation, was set to take over the system for choosing the world champion, following Alekhine's death. One proposal then was to either declare former champion Euwe the new champion, or to hold a match between Euwe and Reshevsky, with the winner becoming the new champion.<ref>''Botvinnik's Best Games 1947\u201370'', by Mikhail Botvinnik; introduction by Viktor Baturinsky, page 1.</ref> But at this stage, the Soviet chess organization was not even a member of FIDE, so how could they influence its decisions!? The Soviets joined FIDE in 1947, and their proposal for the new world championship format (the one originally put forth by Botvinnik the year before in an informal fashion at Groningen) was accepted. Fine eventually declined to play, but otherwise, this wound up being the format used in 1948 to select the new champion, who turned out to be Botvinnik.\n\nBronstein, in his book, writing in 1995, argues that certain other exceptionally strong players, who had emerged during the war years, perhaps could have been invited as well to the 1948 World Championship tournament, especially since Fine had withdrawn. He mentions [[Miguel Najdorf]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Gideon Stahlberg]] and himself. Najdorf had defeated Botvinnik quite drastically at their first meeting, Groningen 1946.\n\nBronstein also criticized the timing and sequencing of the two 1948 major events. The World Championship tournament was held early in 1948, beginning in March, and then the [[Interzonal]] tournament (which Bronstein won) was held later the same year. Bronstein suggests that a fairer method would have been to reverse the order, with the top players from the Interzonal, held first, advancing to the World Championship tournament.\n\nBronstein's allegations are difficult to evaluate. Chess historian Taylor Kingston writes,<ref>[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.pdf The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence, Part II], Taylor Kingston, 1998</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''Bronstein in sum paints a very unflattering picture of Botvinnik: a petty, pompous egoist who reveled in his role as a tin god of Socialist Culture, and who had few if any scruples about reaching and maintaining himself on that pedestal. What to make of this? It could be dismissed as the catty cheap shots of a disgruntled has-been, and some of Bronstein's book does smack of sour grapes and fogeyism. Yet Bronstein has always been respected for his integrity, and the accuracy of his memory. Clearly on the Najdorf veto, either he or Botvinnik is wrong or lying... And it is clear that Bronstein and Botvinnik cannot both be taken at face value.''\n</blockquote>\nThe notion that Botvinnik was an orthodox member of the Soviet system is refuted by the fact that he was one of only three grandmasters ([[Bronstein]] and [[Spassky]] were the others) who refused to sign a condemnation of [[Korchnoi]]'s defection to the West.\n-->\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Playing strength and style ===\n{{further|Comparison of top chess players throughout history}}\n[[Reuben Fine]], writing in 1976, observed that Botvinnik was at or near the top of the chess world for thirty years\u2014from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian\u2014\"a feat equaled historically only by [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fine|first=R.|title=The World's Great Chess Games|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1976|edition=2|pages=263|isbn=0-486-24512-8}}</ref> The statistical rating system used in [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]]'s book ''Warriors of the Mind'' concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Bobby Fischer]] but ahead of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Lasker, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"KeeneDivinskyWarriors\">''Warriors of the Mind'', [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]], 1989.</ref> The [[Chessmetrics]] system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players' best individual years (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935\u20131949 in Botvinnik's case).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 1 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155451/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref name=\"chessmetrics15Years\">{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 15 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154756/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref> In 2005, Chessmetrics' creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of \"world number one\" players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2409 | title=The Greatest Chess Player of All Time \u2013 Part IV |author=Sonas, J. | publisher=Chessbase | year=2005}} Part IV gives links to the three earlier parts</ref>  [[FIDE]] did not adopt the [[Elo rating system]] until 1970, by which time Botvinnik's strength had been declining for several years.

But after the FIDE [[World Chess Championship|world championship cycle]] was established in 1948, reigning champions had to play the strongest contender every three years, and successful title defenses became less common than in the pre-World War II years, when the titleholder could select his challenger. Despite this, Botvinnik held the world title for a longer period than any of his successors except [[Garry Kasparov]]. Botvinnik also became world champion at the relatively late age of 37, because World War II brought international competition to a virtual halt for six years; and he was 52 years old when he finally lost his title (only [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and Emanuel Lasker were older when they were defeated).

This was the only feasible approach for the primitive computers available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, which were only capable of searching three or four [[ply (game theory)|half-moves]] deep (i.e. A's move, B's move, A's move, B's move) if they tried to examine every variation. Botvinnik eventually developed an [[algorithm]] that was reasonably good at finding the right move in difficult positions, but it often missed the right move in simple positions, e.g. where it was possible to checkmate in two moves. This \"selective\" approach turned out to be a [[wikt:dead end|dead end]], as computers were powerful enough by the mid-1970s to perform a [[brute-force search]] (checking all possible moves) several moves deep and today's vastly more powerful computers do this well enough to beat human world champions.<ref name=\"Brudno2000Computer Chess\">{{cite web\n |

[[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] for most of 1948 to 1963. Working as an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[computer scientist]] at the same time, he was one of the very few players who achieved distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive chess. He was also a pioneer of [[computer chess]].\n\nBotvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but the evidence is unclear and some suggest{{who|date=May 2014}} he resisted attempts by Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.\n\nBotvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess, making a significant contribution to the design of the [[World Chess Championship]] system after World War II and becoming a leading member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to dominate top-class chess during that time. His pupils include World Champions [[Anatoly Karpov]], [[Garry Kasparov]] and [[Vladimir Kramnik]].\n\n== Early years ==\n<!-- *****\nWhom did B. marry & when?\nhttp://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=946 refers to her as Gannochka\n\"Achieving the aim\" p 192 Gayane Davidnova\n****** -->\nMikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik was born on August 17, 1911,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> in what was then [[Repino, Saint Petersburg|Kuokkala]], [[Vyborg Governorate]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.jewishgen.org/BELARUS/rje_b.htm | accessdate=2009-06-06\n| title=Russian Jewish Encyclopedia | year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=R.|title=Lenin: a biography|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000|pages=180\u2013181|chapter=Russia from Far and Near|isbn=0-674-00828-6|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frDGHIxc4EUC&pg=PA180&dq=kuokkala#PPR8,M1|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> but is now the district of Repino in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=\"Beizer2007SovietMetropolis\">{{cite book|last=Beizer|first=M.|title=Revolution, repression, and revival|editor=Gitelman, Z. |editor2=Ro'i, Y.|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield: the Soviet Jewish Experience|year=2007|pages=113\u2013119|chapter=The Jews of a Soviet Metropolis|isbn=978-0-7425-5817-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd3RM6Emko0C&pg=PA118&dq=kuokkala+repino#PPA118,M1|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> His parents were [[Russian Jews]], his father was a [[dental technician]] and his mother a [[dentist]],<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=1\u201316|chapter=FirstMoves}}</ref> which allowed the family to live outside the [[Pale of Settlement]] to which most Jews in the [[Russian Empire]] were restricted at the time.

At about the same time, Mikhail started reading newspapers, and became a committed [[Communist]].<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nIn autumn 1923, at the age of twelve,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> Mikhail Botvinnik was taught chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and instantly fell in love with the game.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother's friends, and concluded that for him it was better to think out \"concrete concepts\" and then derive general principles from these \u2013 and went on to beat his brother's friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school's championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the [[Petrograd]] Chess Assembly \u2013 to which the Assembly's President turned a blind eye.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, [[Nikolai Krylenko]], a devoted chess player and leading member of the [[Soviet law|Soviet legal system]] who later organized [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trials]], began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city's Palace of Labor.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nTo test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Krylenko organized the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]]. On a rest day during the event,<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />  world champion [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] gave a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in [[Leningrad]]. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won their game.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> In 1926, he reached the final stage of the Leningrad championship. Later that year, he was selected for Leningrad's team in a match against [[Stockholm]], held in Sweden, and scored +1=1 against the future [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[G\u00f6sta Stoltz]]. On his return, he entertained his schoolmates with a vivid account of the rough sea journey back to Russia. Botvinnik was commissioned to annotate two games from the match, and the fact that his analyses were to be published made him aware of the need for objectivity. In December 1926, he became a candidate member of his school's [[Komsomol]] branch. Around this time his mother became concerned about his poor physique, and as a result he started a program of daily exercise, which he maintained for most of his life.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\n[[File:Botvinnik (1927).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Botvinnik in 1927]]\nWhen Botvinnik finished the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=16\u201322|chapter=The Polytechnic}}</ref> While waiting, he qualified for his first [[USSR Chess Championship|USSR Championship]] final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]] and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the ''Proletstud'', which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\" /> In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the ''Proletstud'', secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where he was one of only four students who entered straight from school. As a result, he had to do a whole year's work in five months, and failed one of the examinations.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\" /> Early in the same year he placed joint third in the semi-final stage of the USSR Championship, and thus failed to reach the final stage.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyXXXXX\" />\n\nHis early progress was fairly rapid, mostly under the training of Soviet Master and coach [[Abram Model]], in [[Leningrad]]; Model taught Botvinnik the Winawer Variation of the [[French Defence]], which was then regarded as inferior for Black, but which Model and Botvinnik analyzed more deeply and then played with great success.<ref>''How to Play the French Defence'', by [[Wolfgang Uhlmann]], Mikhail Botvinnik, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], and [[Anatoly Karpov]], RHM Press, 1975, introduction</ref>\n\nBotvinnik won the Leningrad Masters' tournament in 1930 with 6\u00bd/8, following this up the next year by winning the [[Leningrad City Chess Championship|Championship of Leningrad]] by 2\u00bd points over former Soviet champion [[Peter Romanovsky]].<ref>http://www.chessmetrics.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414132700/http://www.chessmetrics.com/ |date=2006-04-14 }}, the Mikhail Botvinnik results file</ref>\n\nBotvinnik married an Armenian woman named Gayane (Ganna) Davidovna, who was the daughter of his algebra and geometry teacher.

However, aided by his old friend [[Viacheslav Ragozin|Ragozin]] and coach Abram Model, he leveled the score in Leningrad and the match was drawn.

Botvinnik advocated a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] event featuring the top five Soviet players and the five strongest non-Soviet players available. Despite politicking over the Soviet choices, both Krylenko and the Central Committee of the [[Komsomol]] quickly authorised the tournament.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPostgradXXXXX\" /> This was played in Moscow in June 1936,<ref name=\"BotvinnikPostgradXXXXX\" />  and Botvinnik finished second, one&nbsp;point behind Capablanca and 2\u00bd ahead of Flohr.<ref name=\"Golombek1959Capas100BestReturn\" /> However, he took consolation from the fact the Soviet Union's best had held their own against top-class competition.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPostgradXXXXX\" />\n\nIn early winter, 1936, Botvinnik was invited to play in a tournament at [[Nottingham]], England.

In December 1943, he won the Moscow Championship, ahead of Smyslov. At the same time, opposition to his plan for a match with Alekhine re-surfaced, on the grounds that Alekhine was a political enemy and the only proper course was to demand that he be stripped of the title.

He remained involved with competitive chess, appearing in several highly rated tournaments and continuing to produce memorable games.\n\nHe retired from competitive play in 1970, aged 59, preferring instead to occupy himself with the development of [[computer chess]] programs and to assist with the training of younger Soviet players, earning him the nickname of \"Patriarch of the Soviet Chess School\" (see below).\n\nBotvinnik's autobiography, ''K Dostizheniyu Tseli'', was published in Russian in 1978, and in English translation as ''Achieving the Aim'' ({{ISBN|0-08-024120-4}}) in 1981.

Alekhine was of noble background, with a father who was a member of the Fourth Duma. He was one of the top players in the world at the time of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], won the first official Soviet Championship in 1920, then fled Moscow for good shortly afterwards in 1921. This was seen as a shameful repudiation of his homeland, and few crimes were more serious in Soviet eyes at that time. Botvinnik's [[Nottingham]] 1936 victory, the first by a Soviet master outside his homeland, earned him the government's favour.\n\nThe head of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]] in the early-to-mid 1930s was Nikolai Krylenko, also the State prosecutor who had run the infamous [[Show Trials]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s. When Botvinnik lost for the third time (without winning) to [[Fedor Bogatyrchuk]], Krylenko told Bogatyrchuk, \"You will never beat Botvinnik again.\" That proved to be true as the two never played each other again.\n\n[[Boris Verlinsky]] had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (not the same thing as the [[FIDE]] Grandmaster title).<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nBotvinnik did not win the [[AVRO tournament]] of 1938, placing third behind Keres and Fine, yet soon afterwards began angling through the Soviet government channels for a match with Alekhine for the World Championship. Botvinnik did win the 1939 Soviet Championship with a dramatic last-round victory over runner-up [[Alexander Kotov]]. But he played relatively poorly in the very strong 1940 Soviet Championship, finishing in a tie for 5th\u20136th places, with 11.5/19, two full points behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. How would it look for him to be trying for a world title match, yet doing that poorly in his own national championship? With World War II underway by this time, and the strong possibility of little or no chess for some time in the future, Botvinnik seems to have prevailed upon the Soviet chess leadership to hold another tournament \"in order to clarify the situation\".<ref>Egon Varnusz: \"Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games\" (London, Cadogan 1994, translated by Andras Barabas, ISBN 1-85744-064-1), page xi.</ref> This wound up being the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, which featured the top six finishers from the 1940 event, playing each other four times. Botvinnik won this tournament convincingly, to reclaim his prominence.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II with the German invasion in 1941. From 1941 to 1943, Botvinnik gave all of his time to his work as an engineer, visiting and testing power stations, as well as repairing insulations. By the beginning of 1943, he was able to take up chess again on a limited basis, studying and playing two days per week. He won the strong [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] 1943 tournament, and played hors concours in the 1943 Moscow Championship, winning with 13.5/16.\n\nImmediately following the end of the 1946 Groningen tournament, with Alekhine having died earlier that year, and with no set system for choosing the new world champion, Botvinnik personally invited Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Max Euwe, Vasily Smyslov, and Paul Keres to join him in a tournament to decide the new world champion.<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nFIDE, the World Chess Federation, was set to take over the system for choosing the world champion, following Alekhine's death. One proposal then was to either declare former champion Euwe the new champion, or to hold a match between Euwe and Reshevsky, with the winner becoming the new champion.<ref>''Botvinnik's Best Games 1947\u201370'', by Mikhail Botvinnik; introduction by Viktor Baturinsky, page 1.</ref> But at this stage, the Soviet chess organization was not even a member of FIDE, so how could they influence its decisions!? The Soviets joined FIDE in 1947, and their proposal for the new world championship format (the one originally put forth by Botvinnik the year before in an informal fashion at Groningen) was accepted. Fine eventually declined to play, but otherwise, this wound up being the format used in 1948 to select the new champion, who turned out to be Botvinnik.\n\nBronstein, in his book, writing in 1995, argues that certain other exceptionally strong players, who had emerged during the war years, perhaps could have been invited as well to the 1948 World Championship tournament, especially since Fine had withdrawn. He mentions [[Miguel Najdorf]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Gideon Stahlberg]] and himself. Najdorf had defeated Botvinnik quite drastically at their first meeting, Groningen 1946.\n\nBronstein also criticized the timing and sequencing of the two 1948 major events. The World Championship tournament was held early in 1948, beginning in March, and then the [[Interzonal]] tournament (which Bronstein won) was held later the same year. Bronstein suggests that a fairer method would have been to reverse the order, with the top players from the Interzonal, held first, advancing to the World Championship tournament.\n\nBronstein's allegations are difficult to evaluate. Chess historian Taylor Kingston writes,<ref>[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.pdf The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence, Part II], Taylor Kingston, 1998</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''Bronstein in sum paints a very unflattering picture of Botvinnik: a petty, pompous egoist who reveled in his role as a tin god of Socialist Culture, and who had few if any scruples about reaching and maintaining himself on that pedestal. What to make of this? It could be dismissed as the catty cheap shots of a disgruntled has-been, and some of Bronstein's book does smack of sour grapes and fogeyism. Yet Bronstein has always been respected for his integrity, and the accuracy of his memory. Clearly on the Najdorf veto, either he or Botvinnik is wrong or lying... And it is clear that Bronstein and Botvinnik cannot both be taken at face value.''\n</blockquote>\nThe notion that Botvinnik was an orthodox member of the Soviet system is refuted by the fact that he was one of only three grandmasters ([[Bronstein]] and [[Spassky]] were the others) who refused to sign a condemnation of [[Korchnoi]]'s defection to the West.\n-->\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Playing strength and style ===\n{{further|Comparison of top chess players throughout history}}\n[[Reuben Fine]], writing in 1976, observed that Botvinnik was at or near the top of the chess world for thirty years\u2014from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian\u2014\"a feat equaled historically only by [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fine|first=R.|title=The World's Great Chess Games|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1976|edition=2|pages=263|isbn=0-486-24512-8}}</ref> The statistical rating system used in [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]]'s book ''Warriors of the Mind'' concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Bobby Fischer]] but ahead of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Lasker, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"KeeneDivinskyWarriors\">''Warriors of the Mind'', [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]], 1989.</ref> The [[Chessmetrics]] system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players' best individual years (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935\u20131949 in Botvinnik's case).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 1 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155451/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref name=\"chessmetrics15Years\">{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 15 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154756/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref> In 2005, Chessmetrics' creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of \"world number one\" players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2409 | title=The Greatest Chess Player of All Time \u2013 Part IV |author=Sonas, J. | publisher=Chessbase | year=2005}} Part IV gives links to the three earlier parts</ref>  [[FIDE]] did not adopt the [[Elo rating system]] until 1970, by which time Botvinnik's strength had been declining for several years.  According to unofficial calculations by [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d Elo]], Botvinnik was the highest-rated player from 1937 to 1954, peaking about 2730 in 1946.<ref>Elo (1978), p. 89</ref>\n\nThis may seem surprising in the light of Botvinnik's results in the 1950s and early 1960s, when he failed to win a world championship match outright (as reigning champion) and his tournament results were patchy. But after the FIDE [[World Chess Championship|world championship cycle]] was established in 1948, reigning champions had to play the strongest contender every three years, and successful title defenses became less common than in the pre-World War II years, when the titleholder could select his challenger.

This was the only feasible approach for the primitive computers available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, which were only capable of searching three or four [[ply (game theory)|half-moves]] deep (i.e. A's move, B's move, A's move, B's move) if they tried to examine every variation. Botvinnik eventually developed an [[algorithm]] that was reasonably good at finding the right move in difficult positions, but it often missed the right move in simple positions, e.g. where it was possible to checkmate in two moves. This \"selective\" approach turned out to be a [[wikt:dead end|dead end]], as computers were powerful enough by the mid-1970s to perform a [[brute-force search]] (checking all possible moves) several moves deep and today's vastly more powerful computers do this well enough to beat human world champions.<ref name=\"Brudno2000Computer Chess\">{{cite web\n |
