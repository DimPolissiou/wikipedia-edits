Aircraft and surface-to-air missiles of the IAF, with elements of the Army and the Navy participating in their specific areas, where required, carry out interceptions. Civil aviation authorities, in conjunction with the IAF, also assist in this process by ensuring regulatory and control measures, such as assignment of Air Defence Clearance (ADC) numbers to aircraft entering or operating in Indian air space and by confirming the ADC of the incoming traffic, where necessary.<ref>http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/integrated-air-defence-for-the-indian-airspace/</ref>\n\n==Bangladesh==\nBangladesh maintains an ADIZ that extends over the adjoining sea to the south as delineated by the following coordinates:\n(1) 210744.80N891356.50E\n(2) 181554.12N892147.56E\n(3) 164328.74N892554.37E\n(4) 201306.30N920007.60E\n(5) 200332.00N915031.80E\n(6) 175234.06N901504.66E\n\nAll flights of aircraft, civil/military, Bangladeshi or foreign, originating within the ADIZ and those penetrating the Bangladesh ADIZ shall obtain prior permission and Air Defence Clearance (ADC).\n\nAmong other procedures, aircraft flying without a valid ADC number or failing to comply with any restriction or deviating from flight plan will be liable to interception by [[Bangladesh Air Force]].<ref>http://www.caab.gov.bd/aip/sup/aipsup01-18.pdf</ref>\n\n== United States and Canada ==\n{{main|Air Defense Identification Zone (North America)|Air Defense Identification Zone (Washington DC)}}\n\nThe United States and Canada jointly operate an ADIZ that encompasses their sovereign airspace in [[North America]]. The United States maintains two zones in North America \u2014 the [[contiguous United States|Contiguous U.S.]] ADIZ and [[Alaska]] ADIZ \u2014 and two more overseas \u2014 [[Hawaii]] ADIZ and [[Guam]] ADIZ.<ref name=Abeyratne /> Canada operates two other sections of the North American ADIZ, one off the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[British Columbia]] and another that encompasses the [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and its [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navcanada.ca/EN/products-and-services/Documents/DAH_Current_EN.pdf|title=Designated Airspace Handbook|date=25 April 2019|publisher=Nav Canada|accessdate=23 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616125805/https://www.navcanada.ca/EN/products-and-services/Documents/DAH_Current_EN.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2019|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnder US law and policy, the zone applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter US airspace.<ref name=Abeyratne />  An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five air defense identification zones around North America.  If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually. The air defense system reached its peak in 1962. With the deployment of the [[R-7 Semyorka|SS-6]] [[ICBM]] in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat. It does apply to aircraft passing through the zone to other countries.\n\n== Japan ==\n[[Japan]] has an ADIZ that covers most of its [[exclusive economic zone]]. Japan's ADIZ was created by the [[United States Armed Forces]] (USAF) after World War II, with the western border at 123\u00b0 degrees east. This resulted in only the eastern half of [[Yonaguni Island]] being part of Japan's ADIZ and the western half being part of Taiwan's ADIZ. On 25 June 2010, Japan extended its ADIZ around Yonaguni 22&nbsp;km westwards. This led to overlapping with sections of Taiwan's ADIZ. However, Taiwanese foreign affairs officials said that it does not make any difference, as an understanding has been reached between the two parties on how to handle it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/06/26/2003476438 |title=Japan extends ADIZ into Taiwan space |date=26 June 2013 |website=taipeitimes.com |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[China Network Television]] on 24 November 2013, China and Russia do not recognize Japan's ADIZ.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/827189.shtml#.UpV7U7VDvC0 |title=Background: Air Defense Identification Zones |publisher=[[China Network Television]] |date=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Taiwan ==\nTaiwan has an ADIZ that covers most of Taiwan Strait, part of East China Sea and adjacent airspace, most ADIZ of Taiwan is built on its [[exclusive economic zone]]. Taiwan's ADIZ was designed and created by the [[United States Armed Forces]] (USAF) after World War II.\n\n==South Korea==\nSouth Korea operates a zone that covers most but not all of its claimed airspace.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> It does not cover some remote spots.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> The zone was established in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], by the [[United States Air Force]] to block [[communist]] forces.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> In 2013, in response to the establishment of a Chinese zone that covers disputed territory, the South Korean government considered expanding their zone to include islands of [[Marado]] and [[Hongdo]], and [[Ieodo]], a submerged rock within the overlapping [[exclusive economic zone]]s of South Korea and China.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 />\n\nWhen part of or the whole flight route of an aircraft enter the KADIZ area, it is required to send a specific flight plan one hour prior to departure. Civilian aircraft with regular routes should submit a repetitive flight plan to the [[air traffic control]]. There is no need for legal action when an aircraft enters KADIZ as long as the aircraft follows its flight plan reported to the South Korean government. If there is a change in the flight passage or an approach without prior notification, the South Korean air force has the right to immediately identify or track down the aircraft and be prepared for interception. However, military force such as shooting down the plane cannot be exercised.\n\nOn December 8, 2013, the Defense Ministry of Republic of Korea announced the expansion of the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ). After South Korea expanded KADIZ and China established their ADIZ in 2013, certain areas overlap with each other. The KADIZ boundary area at northwest Jeju Island (about 2,300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) overlaps with the East Chinese Sea. Also, South Korea's domestic aircraft cannot avoid entering China's ADIZ near Ieodo even if the flight's purpose is for rescue or searching distressed/missing aircraft. More tension is increasing as the area of South Korea, China and Japan's FIR reiterate with each other.<ref>[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/11/24/64/0301000000AEN20131124002800315F.html \"Air defense zones of China, S.

These responses focused on two related aspects: while hitherto zones had only covered territory that was undisputed at the time of their establishment, China's ADIZ in the [[East China Sea]] covers the Japanese-controlled [[Senkaku Islands]] (Diaoyu Islands in the PRC)<ref name=WSJNov13 /> and also includes [[Socotra Rock]], which is claimed by South Korea.  Secondly, China's zone overlaps with other countries' ADIZ and imposes requirements on both civilian and military aircraft regardless of destination.<ref name=GlobSec/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed that the [[Senkaku Islands dispute]] predates Japan's 1969 establishment of its ADIZ over the islands. Japan holds that there is no record of the People's Republic of China announcing a claim to the Senkaku islands in 1969 or before.<ref>[[Bill Gertz]] (15 September 2010), [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/15/inside-the-ring-145889960/ Inside the Ring] ''[[Washington Times]]''</ref> The PRC, on the other hand, holds that the Diaoyu Island has historically been part of China.\n\nThe Chinese government has noted that any established international limits for defining and enforcing an ADIZ are not clearly defined.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  [[Chuck Hagel]], the [[Secretary of Defense|American Secretary of Defense]], while acknowledging there is nothing new or unique in establishing an ADIZ, criticized the manner in which China had acted as \"unilateral\", \"immediate\" and \"without consultation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131204/hagel-says-chinas-way-setting-air-zone-was-not-wise |title=Hagel says China's way of setting up air zone was \"not wise\" |work=GlobalPost |accessdate=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042744/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131204/hagel-says-chinas-way-setting-air-zone-was-not-wise |archivedate=5 February 2015 }}</ref> American Vice-President [[Joe Biden]] made no public mention of the Chinese ADIZ following his meeting with [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping|Xi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/biden-meets-with-chinese-president-no-public-mention-of-adiz/1803237.html|title=Biden Meets With Chinese President, No Public Mention of ADIZ|work=VOA|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> although elsewhere expressed concern that the Chinese move had escalated tensions in the region.\n\nTokyo brought the matter to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], a U.N. agency to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/japan-calls-for-action-of-china-air-zone/story-fn3dxix6-1226772241095 |title=Japan calls for action of China air zone |last1=Nicolaysen |first1=Lars |date=1 December 2013 |website=theaustralian.com.au |publisher=AAP |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> Australia, Britain and the United States supported Japan's proposal, but China reacted sharply against the proposal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131130/japan-seeks-icaos-involvement-tackling-chinas-air-defe |title=Japan seeks ICAO's involvement in tackling China's air defense zone |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715032356/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131130/japan-seeks-icaos-involvement-tackling-chinas-air-defe |archivedate=2014-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nAs of December 4, 2013 some 55 airlines in 19 countries and three regions have complied with China's ADIZ rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90883/8474992.html |title=55 airlines report flight plans to China: FM -

Civil aviation authorities, in conjunction with the IAF, also assist in this process by ensuring regulatory and control measures, such as assignment of Air Defence Clearance (ADC) numbers to aircraft entering or operating in Indian air space and by confirming the ADC of the incoming traffic, where necessary.<ref>http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/integrated-air-defence-for-the-indian-airspace/</ref>\n\n==Bangladesh==\nBangladesh maintains an ADIZ that extends over the adjoining sea to the south as delineated by the following coordinates:\n(1) 210744.80N891356.50E\n(2) 181554.12N892147.56E\n(3) 164328.74N892554.37E\n(4) 201306.30N920007.60E\n(5) 200332.00N915031.80E\n(6) 175234.06N901504.66E\n\nAll flights of aircraft, civil/military, Bangladeshi or foreign, originating within the ADIZ and those penetrating the Bangladesh ADIZ shall obtain prior permission and Air Defence Clearance (ADC).\n\nAmong other procedures, aircraft flying without a valid ADC number or failing to comply with any restriction or deviating from flight plan will be liable to interception by Bangladesh Air Force.<ref>http://www.caab.gov.bd/aip/sup/aipsup01-18.pdf</ref>\n\n== United States and Canada ==\n{{main|Air Defense Identification Zone (North America)|Air Defense Identification Zone (Washington DC)}}\n\nThe United States and Canada jointly operate an ADIZ that encompasses their sovereign airspace in [[North America]]. The United States maintains two zones in North America \u2014 the [[contiguous United States|Contiguous U.S.]] ADIZ and [[Alaska]] ADIZ \u2014 and two more overseas \u2014 [[Hawaii]] ADIZ and [[Guam]] ADIZ.<ref name=Abeyratne /> Canada operates two other sections of the North American ADIZ, one off the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[British Columbia]] and another that encompasses the [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and its [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.navcanada.ca/EN/products-and-services/Documents/DAH_Current_EN.pdf|title=Designated Airspace Handbook|date=25 April 2019|publisher=Nav Canada|accessdate=23 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616125805/https://www.navcanada.ca/EN/products-and-services/Documents/DAH_Current_EN.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2019|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnder US law and policy, the zone applies only to commercial aircraft intending to enter US airspace.<ref name=Abeyratne />  An air defense command and control structure was developed in 1950, creating five air defense identification zones around North America.  If radio interrogation failed to identify an aircraft in the ADIZ, the Air Force launched interceptor aircraft to identify the intruder visually. The air defense system reached its peak in 1962. With the deployment of the [[R-7 Semyorka|SS-6]] [[ICBM]] in the USSR, strategic threats shifted overwhelmingly to ICBM attacks, and bomber intrusions were considered to be less of a threat. It does apply to aircraft passing through the zone to other countries.\n\n== Japan ==\n[[Japan]] has an ADIZ that covers most of its [[exclusive economic zone]]. Japan's ADIZ was created by the [[United States Armed Forces]] (USAF) after World War II, with the western border at 123\u00b0 degrees east. This resulted in only the eastern half of [[Yonaguni Island]] being part of Japan's ADIZ and the western half being part of Taiwan's ADIZ. On 25 June 2010, Japan extended its ADIZ around Yonaguni 22&nbsp;km westwards. This led to overlapping with sections of Taiwan's ADIZ. However, Taiwanese foreign affairs officials said that it does not make any difference, as an understanding has been reached between the two parties on how to handle it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/06/26/2003476438 |title=Japan extends ADIZ into Taiwan space |date=26 June 2013 |website=taipeitimes.com |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[China Network Television]] on 24 November 2013, China and Russia do not recognize Japan's ADIZ.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/827189.shtml#.UpV7U7VDvC0 |title=Background: Air Defense Identification Zones |publisher=[[China Network Television]] |date=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Taiwan ==\nTaiwan has an ADIZ that covers most of Taiwan Strait, part of East China Sea and adjacent airspace, most ADIZ of Taiwan is built on its [[exclusive economic zone]]. Taiwan's ADIZ was designed and created by the [[United States Armed Forces]] (USAF) after World War II.\n\n==South Korea==\nSouth Korea operates a zone that covers most but not all of its claimed airspace.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> It does not cover some remote spots.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> The zone was established in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], by the [[United States Air Force]] to block [[communist]] forces.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 /> In 2013, in response to the establishment of a Chinese zone that covers disputed territory, the South Korean government considered expanding their zone to include islands of [[Marado]] and [[Hongdo]], and [[Ieodo]], a submerged rock within the overlapping [[exclusive economic zone]]s of South Korea and China.<ref name=KoreaHerDec13 />\n\nWhen part of or the whole flight route of an aircraft enter the KADIZ area, it is required to send a specific flight plan one hour prior to departure. Civilian aircraft with regular routes should submit a repetitive flight plan to the [[air traffic control]]. There is no need for legal action when an aircraft enters KADIZ as long as the aircraft follows its flight plan reported to the South Korean government. If there is a change in the flight passage or an approach without prior notification, the South Korean air force has the right to immediately identify or track down the aircraft and be prepared for interception. However, military force such as shooting down the plane cannot be exercised.\n\nOn December 8, 2013, the Defense Ministry of Republic of Korea announced the expansion of the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ). After South Korea expanded KADIZ and China established their ADIZ in 2013, certain areas overlap with each other. The KADIZ boundary area at northwest Jeju Island (about 2,300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) overlaps with the East Chinese Sea. Also, South Korea's domestic aircraft cannot avoid entering China's ADIZ near Ieodo even if the flight's purpose is for rescue or searching distressed/missing aircraft. More tension is increasing as the area of South Korea, China and Japan's FIR reiterate with each other.<ref>[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/11/24/64/0301000000AEN20131124002800315F.html \"Air defense zones of China, S.

These responses focused on two related aspects: while hitherto zones had only covered territory that was undisputed at the time of their establishment, China's ADIZ in the [[East China Sea]] covers the Japanese-controlled [[Senkaku Islands]] (Diaoyu Islands in the PRC)<ref name=WSJNov13 /> and also includes [[Socotra Rock]], which is claimed by South Korea.  Secondly, China's zone overlaps with other countries' ADIZ and imposes requirements on both civilian and military aircraft regardless of destination.<ref name=GlobSec/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIt has been claimed that the [[Senkaku Islands dispute]] predates Japan's 1969 establishment of its ADIZ over the islands. Japan holds that there is no record of the People's Republic of China announcing a claim to the Senkaku islands in 1969 or before.<ref>[[Bill Gertz]] (15 September 2010), [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/15/inside-the-ring-145889960/ Inside the Ring] ''[[Washington Times]]''</ref> The PRC, on the other hand, holds that the Diaoyu Island has historically been part of China.\n\nThe Chinese government has noted that any established international limits for defining and enforcing an ADIZ are not clearly defined.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  [[Chuck Hagel]], the [[Secretary of Defense|American Secretary of Defense]], while acknowledging there is nothing new or unique in establishing an ADIZ, criticized the manner in which China had acted as \"unilateral\", \"immediate\" and \"without consultation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131204/hagel-says-chinas-way-setting-air-zone-was-not-wise |title=Hagel says China's way of setting up air zone was \"not wise\" |work=GlobalPost |accessdate=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205042744/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131204/hagel-says-chinas-way-setting-air-zone-was-not-wise |archivedate=5 February 2015 }}</ref> American Vice-President [[Joe Biden]] made no public mention of the Chinese ADIZ following his meeting with [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping|Xi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/biden-meets-with-chinese-president-no-public-mention-of-adiz/1803237.html|title=Biden Meets With Chinese President, No Public Mention of ADIZ|work=VOA|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> although elsewhere expressed concern that the Chinese move had escalated tensions in the region.\n\nTokyo brought the matter to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], a U.N. agency to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation throughout the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/japan-calls-for-action-of-china-air-zone/story-fn3dxix6-1226772241095 |title=Japan calls for action of China air zone |last1=Nicolaysen |first1=Lars |date=1 December 2013 |website=theaustralian.com.au |publisher=AAP |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> Australia, Britain and the United States supported Japan's proposal, but China reacted sharply against the proposal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131130/japan-seeks-icaos-involvement-tackling-chinas-air-defe |title=Japan seeks ICAO's involvement in tackling China's air defense zone |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715032356/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/131130/japan-seeks-icaos-involvement-tackling-chinas-air-defe |archivedate=2014-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nAs of December 4, 2013 some 55 airlines in 19 countries and three regions have complied with China's ADIZ rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90883/8474992.html |title=55 airlines report flight plans to China: FM - People's Daily Online |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-06}}</ref> After initial indication by South Korea's [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (Korea)|Ministry of Transport]] that South Korean airlines would not recognize the Chinese ADIZ,<ref name=KoreaHerDec13>{{cite web |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20131201000304 |title=Seoul considers southward expansion of air defense zone |website=The Korea Herald |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> South Korea's Asiana Airline and Korean Air later chose to abide by the ADIZ.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/south-koreas-asiana-airlines-korean-air-abide-chinese-air-defense-identification-zone-adiz-1506882 |title=South Korea's Asiana Airlines And Korean Air Abide By Chinese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)|website=International Business Times |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>  Japan said its airlines would not recognize the zone.\n\nIn 2014, China's Foreign Ministry dismissed reports that they were considering a similar ADIZ over the [[South China Sea]], as the countries in [[ASEAN]] were no threat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-02/02/c_126085456.htm |title=China dismisses ADIZ reports, optimistic about South China Sea situation |last1=Xuequan |first1=Mu |date=2 February 2014 |website=xinhuanet.com |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:Air Defense Identification Zone| ]]\n[[Category:Air traffic control]]\n[[Category:Air defense]]\n", "name_user": "Squad 71", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBangladesh", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_defense_identification_zone"}
