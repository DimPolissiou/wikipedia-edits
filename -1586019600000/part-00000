Hagaman]] had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks.  The name \"Concordia\" was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters (\"Cap\" Snyder) had once lived in [[Concordia, Missouri]].\n\nDecember 1869 was the first election for the county seat with Concordia, [[Clyde, Kansas|Clyde]] and the now defunct town [[Sibley, Kansas|Sibley]].  Without a clear majority, a second election was held between Concordia and Sibley on January 4, 1870.  Concordia was declared the winner over Sibley 165 votes to 129.\n\nIt was over a year later when Concordia officially became a town when the Republican Land District Office opened on January 16, 1871.  The Concordia Land Office continued until February 28, 1889 when it was consolidated with the land office in [[Topeka, Kansas]].\n\nAlso in 1871, Concordia elected its first mayor, R. E. Allen.  Under his leadership, Concordia was officially incorporated as a third class city under Kansas law in August 1872.\n\nConcordia was visited in its early years by many traveling shows.  As early as 1876 various traveling entertainers including [[Wild Bill Hickock]], [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], [[Ringling Brothers]], and others came to Concordia.  In 1892, the Ringling train wrecked east of the town killing two men and twenty horses, but the show played the next day to a crowd of 4,000.\n\nThe first schoolteacher to teach inside the city limits was Milo Stevens, who was paid a salary of twenty dollars per month.<ref>[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/cloud/1903/kansas8.shtml#07901 ''Biographical history of Cloud County, Kansas''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231062510/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/cloud/1903/kansas8.shtml#07901 |date=2006-12-31 }} \"First School in Concordia\" by E.F.

In 1996, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and renamed to the current [[BNSF Railway]].  Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\".\n\nIn 1897, [[Pope Leo XIII]] founded the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Concordia, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04206b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Concordia (In America)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref>  The diocese operated until 1947 when it was merged with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina]].

Records are mixed, but the date is placed between 1908 and 1910.  The ''Concordia Blade'' newspaper (now the ''[[Concordia Blade-Empire]]'') reported:\n<blockquote>\n\"Carrie Nation is in town.  That wonderfully brave little woman who started the crusade against Kansas saloons lectured at the M.E. Church this afternoon, and will talk again tonight at the courthouse.  While in this city she is the guest of Mrs. George Mohr.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Us81.jpg|thumb|right|1912 [[Meridian Highway]] Inspection team]]\nA major geographic change in the city and the area occurred on July 9, 1902.  The [[Republican River]] flooded near town and broke a dam.  The flooding resulted in re-routing the river by 1/4 of a mile.<ref>'''A Proud Past... A Pictorial History of Concordia, Kansas''', by Bell, Rachel Lowrey (1998), Marceline, Missouri: D-Books Publishing, p 10-21</ref>\n\nThe year of 1912 brought a major blizzard to Concordia with snow so deep that a Union Pacific train became stuck northeast of town and snowbanks on main street piled as high as peoples' heads.  Also in 1912, the first official inspection team for [[Meridian Highway]] (now [[US-81]]) came through Concordia on their tour from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]].  In 1913, the [[Missouri Pacific Railway]] [[Train station|depot]] was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old building.\n\nAnother flood took place on June 20, 1915.  Damage from the flood was significant but not as wide-sweeping as the flood of 1902.<ref>'''A Proud Past...

Hagaman]] had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks.  The name \"Concordia\" was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters (\"Cap\" Snyder) had once lived in [[Concordia, Missouri]].\n\nDecember 1869 was the first election for the county seat with Concordia, [[Clyde, Kansas|Clyde]] and the now defunct town [[Sibley, Kansas|Sibley]].  Without a clear majority, a second election was held between Concordia and Sibley on January 4, 1870.  Concordia was declared the winner over Sibley 165 votes to 129.\n\nIt was over a year later when Concordia officially became a town when the Republican Land District Office opened on January 16, 1871.  The Concordia Land Office continued until February 28, 1889 when it was consolidated with the land office in [[Topeka, Kansas]].\n\nAlso in 1871, Concordia elected its first mayor, R. E. Allen.  Under his leadership, Concordia was officially incorporated as a third class city under Kansas law in August 1872.\n\nConcordia was visited in its early years by many traveling shows.  As early as 1876 various traveling entertainers including [[Wild Bill Hickock]], [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], [[Ringling Brothers]], and others came to Concordia.  In 1892, the Ringling train wrecked east of the town killing two men and twenty horses, but the show played the next day to a crowd of 4,000.\n\nThe first schoolteacher to teach inside the city limits was Milo Stevens, who was paid a salary of twenty dollars per month.<ref>[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/cloud/1903/kansas8.shtml#07901 ''Biographical history of Cloud County, Kansas''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231062510/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/cloud/1903/kansas8.shtml#07901 |date=2006-12-31 }} \"First School in Concordia\" by E.F.

In 1996, the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] merged with [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and renamed to the current [[BNSF Railway]].  Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\".\n\nIn 1897, [[Pope Leo XIII]] founded the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Concordia, Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04206b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Concordia (In America)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref>  The diocese operated until 1947 when it was merged with the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina]].

Records are mixed, but the date is placed between 1908 and 1910.  The ''Concordia Blade'' newspaper (now the ''[[Concordia Blade-Empire]]'') reported:\n<blockquote>\n\"Carrie Nation is in town.  That wonderfully brave little woman who started the crusade against Kansas saloons lectured at the M.E. Church this afternoon, and will talk again tonight at the courthouse.  While in this city she is the guest of Mrs. George Mohr.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Us81.jpg|thumb|right|1912 [[Meridian Highway]] Inspection team]]\nA major geographic change in the city and the area occurred on July 9, 1902.  The [[Republican River]] flooded near town and broke a dam.  The flooding resulted in re-routing the river by 1/4 of a mile.<ref>'''A Proud Past... A Pictorial History of Concordia, Kansas''', by Bell, Rachel Lowrey (1998), Marceline, Missouri: D-Books Publishing, p 10-21</ref>\n\nThe year of 1912 brought a major blizzard to Concordia with snow so deep that a Union Pacific train became stuck northeast of town and snowbanks on main street piled as high as peoples' heads.  Also in 1912, the first official inspection team for [[Meridian Highway]] (now [[US-81]]) came through Concordia on their tour from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]].  In 1913, the [[Missouri Pacific Railway]] [[Train station|depot]] was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old building.\n\nAnother flood took place on June 20, 1915.  Damage from the flood was significant but not as wide-sweeping as the flood of 1902.<ref>'''A Proud Past...

It was released as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from the record on January 30, and later serviced to US alternative radio stations on February 19, 2019, with both releases occurring through Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]]. Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote the song, with the latter solely producing it. The song was described as [[synth-pop]] and [[electronica]] in press reviews, for which [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] beats, percussion, and a [[synthesizer]] provide [[Minimalism|minimalist]] instrumentation. Within the dark and violent lyrics, Eilish sings from the perspective of a monster under someone's bed. Her vocals are subtle and treated with layers of vocal effects.\n\nUpon release, \"Bury a Friend\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, several of whom praised its dark nature and lyrics. The song was also likened to the music of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Lorde]] and [[Kanye West]]. It attained commercial success, including reaching number one in Sweden and Latvia. The song further peaked within the top ten in several countries, such as New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. [[Music Canada]] awarded it a triple platinum [[Music recording certification|certification]], among others.\n\n[[Michael Chaves (director)|Michael Chaves]] directed the music video for \"Bury a Friend\", which was uploaded to Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the song's first release. The video depicts Eilish involved in several activities, including singing under the bed of British rapper Crooks, who provides uncredited vocals on the song, being pulled by black gloves and walking through a rundown apartment. Critics noted the video's [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. Eilish promoted the song by performing it live at venues in 2019, including [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[Glastonbury Festival]] and during her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]]. It was also included on the setlist of her 2020 [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.<ref name=\"credits\"/>|alt=An image of a blonde-haired man wearing a suit and sunglasses against a purple-red backdrop.]]\nOn January 29, 2019, Billie Eilish formally announced the release of ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' and also revealed that she would release a single the next day at 9 AM ([[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]).

Friend'''\" is a song by American singer [[Billie Eilish]] from her debut studio album, ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' (2019). It was released as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from the record on January 30, and later serviced to US alternative radio stations on February 19, 2019, with both releases occurring through Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]]. Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote the song, with the latter solely producing it. The song was described as [[synth-pop]] and [[electronica]] in press reviews, for which [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] beats, percussion, and a [[synthesizer]] provide [[Minimalism|minimalist]] instrumentation. Within the dark and violent lyrics, Eilish sings from the perspective of a monster under someone's bed. Her vocals are subtle and treated with layers of vocal effects.\n\nUpon release, \"Bury a Friend\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, several of whom praised its dark nature and lyrics. The song was also likened to the music of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Lorde]] and [[Kanye West]]. It attained commercial success, including reaching number one in Sweden and Latvia. The song further peaked within the top ten in several countries, such as New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. [[Music Canada]] awarded it a triple platinum [[Music recording certification|certification]], among others.\n\n[[Michael Chaves (director)|Michael Chaves]] directed the music video for \"Bury a Friend\", which was uploaded to Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the song's first release. The video depicts Eilish involved in several activities, including singing under the bed of British rapper Crooks, who provides uncredited vocals on the song, being pulled by black gloves and walking through a rundown apartment. Critics noted the video's [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. Eilish promoted the song by performing it live at venues in 2019, including [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[Glastonbury Festival]] and during her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]]. It was also included on the setlist of her 2020 [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.<ref name=\"credits\"/>|alt=An image of a blonde-haired man wearing a suit and sunglasses against a purple-red backdrop.]]\nOn January 29, 2019, Billie Eilish formally announced the release of ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' and also revealed that she would release a single the next day at 9 AM ([[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]).

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski\">{{cite book |author=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112\u2013123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=|author-link=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski }}</ref> ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000\u2013600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.\"{{r|Leslie|p=234}} On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.{{r|Leslie|p=234}}\n\n==Relations with other factions==\n\n===Relations with Jews===\n{{see also|Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n\nHome Army members' attitudes toward Jews varied widely from unit to unit, and the topic remains controversial.<ref name=\"Radzilowski\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert D.

[However] to the Home Army, the Jews were not a part of 'our nation' and ... action to defend them was not to be taken if it endangered [the Home Army's] other objectives.\" He continues to observe that \"it is probably unrealistic to have expected the Home Army\u2014which was neither as well armed nor as well organized as its propaganda claimed\u2014to have been able to do much to aid the Jews.

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski\">{{cite book |author=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112\u2013123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=|author-link=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski }}</ref> ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000\u2013600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.\"{{r|Leslie|p=234}} On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.{{r|Leslie|p=234}}\n\n==Relations with other factions==\n\n===Relations with Jews===\n{{see also|Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n\nHome Army members' attitudes toward Jews varied widely from unit to unit, and the topic remains controversial.<ref name=\"Radzilowski\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert D.

[However] to the Home Army, the Jews were not a part of 'our nation' and ... action to defend them was not to be taken if it endangered [the Home Army's] other objectives.\" He continues to observe that \"it is probably unrealistic to have expected the Home Army\u2014which was neither as well armed nor as well organized as its propaganda claimed\u2014to have been able to do much to aid the Jews.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays. In 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him one of [[Time 100|the world\u2019s 100 most influential people]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Chalmers entrance.jpg|thumb|Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology]]\nKjellberg was born on 24 October 1989, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, where he was also raised.<ref name=Expressen1 /><ref name=Leskin2019>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 30-year-old video creator who just returned to YouTube after a 30-day hiatus|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=5 March 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219173542/https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|archive-date=10 September 2019}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 29-year-old who says he's 'definitely' worth more than $20 million (original title)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna ([[n\u00e9e]] Hellstrand, born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his older sister Fanny.<ref name=Rosengren2012/> His mother, a former [[Chief information officer|CIO]], was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.<ref name=Rosengren2012>{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=Lina |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |title=Han hoppade av Chalmers&nbsp;\u2013 blev heltidsk\u00e4ndis p\u00e5 Youtube |work=[[International Data Group|IDG.se]] |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |language=Swedish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121164838/http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}</ref> His father is also a corporate executive.<ref name=Dewey2015/>\n\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], as well as play video games on his [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|title=PewDiePie Biography|author=Biography.com Editors|date=28 November 2017|work=Biography|publisher=[[A&E Networks|A&E Television Networks]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027232032/https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|archive-date=27 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Parker2015/> During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet caf\u00e9 with friends.<ref name=Parker2015/> He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at [[Chalmers University of Technology]], but left the university in 2011.<ref name=Johnsson2014/><ref name=Gallagher2013/> While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,<ref name=Gallagher2013>{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |title=Meet Felix Kjellberg&nbsp;\u2013 the new 'King of the Web' |work=[[The Independent]]|date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122212837/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |archivedate=22 November 2013 }}</ref> in 2017, Kjellberg clarified that he left because of his lack of interest in his course of study.

formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays. In 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him one of [[Time 100|the world\u2019s 100 most influential people]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Chalmers entrance.jpg|thumb|Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology]]\nKjellberg was born on 24 October 1989, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, where he was also raised.<ref name=Expressen1 /><ref name=Leskin2019>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 30-year-old video creator who just returned to YouTube after a 30-day hiatus|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=5 March 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219173542/https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|archive-date=10 September 2019}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 29-year-old who says he's 'definitely' worth more than $20 million (original title)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna ([[n\u00e9e]] Hellstrand, born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his older sister Fanny.<ref name=Rosengren2012/> His mother, a former [[Chief information officer|CIO]], was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.<ref name=Rosengren2012>{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=Lina |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |title=Han hoppade av Chalmers&nbsp;\u2013 blev heltidsk\u00e4ndis p\u00e5 Youtube |work=[[International Data Group|IDG.se]] |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |language=Swedish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121164838/http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}</ref> His father is also a corporate executive.<ref name=Dewey2015/>\n\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], as well as play video games on his [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|title=PewDiePie Biography|author=Biography.com Editors|date=28 November 2017|work=Biography|publisher=[[A&E Networks|A&E Television Networks]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027232032/https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|archive-date=27 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Parker2015/> During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet caf\u00e9 with friends.<ref name=Parker2015/> He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at [[Chalmers University of Technology]], but left the university in 2011.<ref name=Johnsson2014/><ref name=Gallagher2013/> While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,<ref name=Gallagher2013>{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |title=Meet Felix Kjellberg&nbsp;\u2013 the new 'King of the Web' |work=[[The Independent]]|date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122212837/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |archivedate=22 November 2013 }}</ref> in 2017, Kjellberg clarified that he left because of his lack of interest in his course of study.

At that time it was given the name ''Concepci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda Pur\u00edsima del Nuevo Extremo'' (Mary Immaculate Conception of the New End). The new settlement of Concepci\u00f3n was just a few kilometers north of ''[[La Frontera (geographical region)|La Frontera]]'' (The Frontier), the boundary between [[Spain|Spanish]] territory and the land of the [[Mapuche]], an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish arrival to the Concepci\u00f3n area chronicler [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar]] noted local Mapuches wore gold and silver [[bracelet]]s and \"sort of crowns\". This is interpreted either as [[Incas in Central Chile|Incan]] gifts, war spoils from defeated Incas, or adoption of Incan [[metallurgy]].<ref name=Silva1983>{{cite journal |last1=Silva Galdames |first1=Osvaldo |date=1983 |title=\u00bfDetuvo la batalla del Maule la expansi\u00f3n inca hacia el sur de Chile? |url=https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |journal=Cuadernos de Historia |language=Spanish |volume=3 |issue= |pages=7\u201325 |doi= |access-date=January 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013520/https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |archive-date=February 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Concepci\u00f3n was a significant military settlement for the [[Captaincy General of Chile]], it was overrun and destroyed by [[Arauco War|Mapuche armies]] in 1554, and once again after being refounded in 1555. Concepci\u00f3n was restored during the governorship of [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]] when he landed there and built a fort on the Alto de Pinto in 1557. The town was refounded once more on January 6, 1558, by captain Jer\u00f3nimo de Villegas. It became the headquarters of the military forces engaged against the [[Mapuche]] in [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|La Araucan\u00eda]] over the next two centuries, growing to a population of 10,000 despite a [[siege]] in 1564 and other attacks by the Mapuche. Concepci\u00f3n was the home of the [[Audiencia Real|Real Audiencia]] from 1565 to 1575.\n\n[[Earthquakes]] and [[tsunamis]], which razed the town in [[1570 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|1570]], 1657, 1687, 1730 and [[1751 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|1751]], led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the [[Valle de la Mocha]], alongside the [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]]; the old site lay empty until March 29, 1842, when the present town of [[Penco]] was founded.\n\nThe new site for the town of Concepci\u00f3n became the main town of the Intendancy of Concepci\u00f3n, whose jurisdiction extended from the [[Maule River]] to La Frontera. The first Intendant of Concepci\u00f3n was the Irishman [[Ambrose O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno]], who later became [[Royal Governor of Chile]] and [[List of Viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]].\n\nWhen the First National Government Board met in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on September 18, 1810, citizens of Concepci\u00f3n joined up. Concepci\u00f3n was used as the point of entry by the Spanish Army in the attempt by the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] to re-conquer Chile. Concepci\u00f3n politicians and soldiers became a significant political force in the newly independent country.\n\nOn January 1, 1818, Ambrose O'Higgins's son, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], proclaimed and took the oath of the [[Chilean War of Independence]] in the main square of Concepci\u00f3n, which since then has been known as \"Plaza de la Independencia\". On February 20, 1835, the town again was largely destroyed by [[1835 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|an earthquake]] and had to be rebuilt.\n\nBy 1875, a key British community and German colony existed within the province.  By 1895, there was an even larger Spanish presence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmundson |first1=William |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230114838 |pages=126}}</ref>\n\nConcepci\u00f3n is the second largest city of Chile.

In May 24 of 1751 an [[1751 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|earthquake]] followed by a [[tsunami]], ravaged the city causing serious damage, including the destruction of the library of the University and all of its funds. As a product of the fury of the waters, a rich collection of texts of the governance of southern Chile were lost, which resulted in a disaster for the culture and collective memory of the city. Due to the natural disasters, it was decided to relocate the city to the called [[Valle de la Mocha]], location where it is currently situated. Slowly the seminary was revived in the new location, in a period of decline in academic activity in Chilean monastic universities after the creation of the [[Universidad de San Felipe]], yet some degrees continued to be granted before the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1767.\nThe aforementioned University is considered to be the natural and legitimate predecessor of the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]] (UCSC), erected by the Archbishop of Concepci\u00f3n in 1991, from the [[Talcahuano]] Regional Headquarters of the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]].\n\nThe image of the Pontifical University of Concepci\u00f3n Pencopolitana, is still valid, for His Majesty [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in his 1990 speech on the occasion of his inauguration as Doctor Honoris Causa in the [[University of Chile]], in [[Santiago de Chile]], said: \"The work of the Pontifical University Pencopolitana should not be ignored, even before the creation of the University of San Felipe\" (Juan Carlos's account fails to acknowledge the existence of San Felipe's predecessor, the Dominican Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino, from the sixteenth century in Santiago).\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Chile  allowed schools in the city to teach courses in law which allowed men to obtain a law degree. Among itsstudents was Henry Urrutia Manzano, who decades later became president of the Supreme Court of Chile.\n\nThe [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]] was created in 1919 by a group of citizens including [[Enrique Molina Garmendia]], its first rector.\n\nEventually the university began to receive state support, becoming part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities|traditional universities]], becoming one of three most important universities in the country, and the most importance at the regional level.\n\n====Traditional universities====\n* [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Universidad del B\u00edo-B\u00edo]]\n* [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda]]\n\n====Private universities====\n* [[Universidad del Desarrollo]]\n* [[Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello]]\n* [[Universidad de Artes y Ciencias Sociales|Universidad Arcis]]\n* [[Universidad San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\n* [[Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s (Chile)|Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s]]\n* [[University of the Pacific (Chile)]]\n* [[Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas (Chile)|Universidad de Las Am\u00e9ricas]]\n* [[Universidad Bolivariana]]\n* [[Universidad Pedro de Valdivia]]\n* [[Universidad La Rep\u00fablica]]\n* [[Universidad de Aconcagua]]\n* [[:es:Inacap|Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Chile INACAP]]\n\n===Professional institutes===\n* [[Instituto Profesional DuocUC]], of the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Virginio G\u00f3mez]], of the [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n|Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico]], of the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Santo Tom\u00e1s]], of the [[Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s (Chile)|Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional AIEP]], of the [[Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional La Araucana]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Providencia]]\n* [[Instituto de Estudios Bancarios Guillermo Subercaseaux]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Diego Portales]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Crecic]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Placex]]\n* [[:es:Inacap|Instituto Profesional INACAP]]\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n{{expand section|date=April 2015}}\nThe city has a French international school, the ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle (Chile)|Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle]]'' and a German school, the Colegio Alem\u00e1n de Concepci\u00f3n and a British school, Saint John's School, the former located in the city downtown and the latter examples in San Pedro de la Paz. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dsc.cl/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805104650/http://www.dsc.cl/ |archive-date=2018-08-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nThe city is served by [[Carriel Sur International Airport]] in Talcahuano.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Concepci\u00f3n is classified as [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'', with a dry summer nadir in February.

Summer temperatures for the [[36th parallel south|36 degrees latitude]] are rarely as cool as they are in Concepci\u00f3n, and on the Atlantic coast of Argentina, similar or hotter summer temperatures are found much further from the equator. However, this moderation is evident for the entire Chilean Pacific so is not unique for Concepci\u00f3n. Similar cool-summer [[mediterranean climate]] tendencies are found on the West Coast of North America on similar parallels, even though Concepci\u00f3n tends to have slightly wetter winters than [[San Francisco]] for example.\nConversely, record winter nighttime temperatures in Concepcion are significantly more moderate than temperatures recorded on the Argentine Atlantic coast at the same latitude, where temperatures below {{convert|-10|C|F}} have occurred.<ref>[https://www.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207103528/https://www.smn.gob.ar/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-estad%C3%ADsticas-de-largo-plazo |date=2019-02-07 }}{{Servicio Meteorologico Nacional|date=September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location     = Concepci\u00f3n, Chile ([[Carriel Sur International Airport]]) 1981\u20132010, extremes 1966\u2013present\n|metric first = yes\n|single line  = yes\n|Jan record high C = 34.1\n|Feb record high C = 33.2\n|Mar record high C = 30.9\n|Apr record high C = 27.2\n|May record high C = 25.8\n|Jun record high C = 22.0\n|Jul record high C = 21.7\n|Aug record high C = 25.0\n|Sep record high C = 28.8\n|Oct record high C = 27.6\n|Nov record high C = 32.5\n|Dec record high C = 33.4\n|year record high C = 34.1\n|Jan high C = 22.8\n|Feb high C = 22.5\n|Mar high C = 21.0\n|Apr high C = 18.3\n|May high C = 15.4\n|Jun high C = 13.7\n|Jul high C = 13.2\n|Aug high C = 14.0\n|Sep high C = 15.5\n|Oct high C = 17.2\n|Nov high C = 19.4\n|Dec high C = 21.4\n|year high C = 17.9\n|Jan mean C = 16.5\n|Feb mean C = 15.9\n|Mar mean C = 14.5\n|Apr mean C = 12.3\n|May mean C = 10.7\n|Jun mean C = 9.5\n|Jul mean C = 8.8\n|Aug mean C = 9.3\n|Sep mean C = 10.2\n|Oct mean C = 11.9\n|Nov mean C = 13.8\n|Dec mean C = 15.6\n|year mean C = 12.4\n|Jan low C = 10.9\n|Feb low C = 10.6\n|Mar low C = 9.8\n|Apr low C = 8.1\n|May low C = 7.5\n|Jun low C = 6.6\n|Jul low C = 5.8\n|Aug low C = 6.0\n|Sep low C = 6.1\n|Oct low C = 7.4\n|Nov low C = 8.7\n|Dec low C = 10.1\n|year low C = 8.1\n|Jan record low C = 0.9\n|Feb record low C = 3.6\n|Mar record low C = 1.6\n|Apr record low C = -1.0\n|May record low C = -2.1\n|Jun record low C = -2.2\n|Jul record low C = -3.8\n|Aug record low C = -2.5\n|Sep record low C = -1.4\n|Oct record low C = -0.8\n|Nov record low C = 1.0\n|Dec record low C = 3.4\n|year record low C = -3.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 15.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 15.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 25.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 72.4\n|May precipitation mm = 182.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 230.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 198.4\n|Aug precipitation mm = 153.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 84.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 57.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 33.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 21.3\n|year precipitation mm = 1090.3\n|Jan rain days = 2.6\n|Feb rain days = 2.6\n|Mar rain days = 3.7\n|Apr rain days = 7.6\n|May rain days = 14.5\n|Jun rain days = 16.1\n|Jul rain days = 15.3\n|Aug rain days = 13.5\n|Sep rain days = 10.2\n|Oct rain days = 7.6\n|Nov rain days = 4.8\n|Dec rain days = 3.5\n|year rain days = 102.0\n|unit rain days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 77\n|Mar humidity = 80\n|Apr humidity = 83\n|May humidity = 87\n|Jun humidity = 88\n|Jul humidity = 86\n|Aug humidity = 85\n|Sep humidity = 82\n|Oct humidity = 81\n|Nov humidity = 78\n|Dec humidity = 76\n|year humidity = 82\n|Jan sun = 341\n|Feb sun = 278\n|Mar sun = 255\n|Apr sun = 191\n|May sun = 133\n|Jun sun = 114\n|Jul sun = 129\n|Aug sun = 162\n|Sep sun = 197\n|Oct sun = 254\n|Nov sun = 296\n|Dec sun = 331\n|year sun = \n|source 1  = Direcci\u00f3n Meteorol\u00f3gica de Chile (precipitation days and humidity 1970\u20132000)<ref name=climatenormals>{{cite web\n| url = https://climatologia.meteochile.gob.cl/application/index/productos/RE3006\n| title = Datos Normales y Promedios Hist\u00f3ricos Promedios de 30 a\u00f1os o menos\n| publisher = Direcci\u00f3n Meteorol\u00f3gica de Chile\n| language = Spanish\n| accessdate = 10 December 2018\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180917105206/https://climatologia.meteochile.gob.cl/application/index/productos/RE3006\n| archive-date = 17 September 2018\n| url-status = live\n}}</ref><ref name=records>{{cite web\n| url = https://climatologia.meteochile.gob.cl/application/index/productos/RE3002\n| title = Temperatura Hist\u00f3rica de la Estaci\u00f3n Carriel Sur, Concepci\u00f3n.

Vernon, 1969</ref> in 1550 north of the [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]], at the site which is today known as [[Penco]]. At that time it was given the name ''Concepci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda Pur\u00edsima del Nuevo Extremo'' (Mary Immaculate Conception of the New End). The new settlement of Concepci\u00f3n was just a few kilometers north of ''[[La Frontera (geographical region)|La Frontera]]'' (The Frontier), the boundary between [[Spain|Spanish]] territory and the land of the [[Mapuche]], an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish arrival to the Concepci\u00f3n area chronicler [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar]] noted local Mapuches wore gold and silver [[bracelet]]s and \"sort of crowns\". This is interpreted either as [[Incas in Central Chile|Incan]] gifts, war spoils from defeated Incas, or adoption of Incan [[metallurgy]].<ref name=Silva1983>{{cite journal |last1=Silva Galdames |first1=Osvaldo |date=1983 |title=\u00bfDetuvo la batalla del Maule la expansi\u00f3n inca hacia el sur de Chile? |url=https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |journal=Cuadernos de Historia |language=Spanish |volume=3 |issue= |pages=7\u201325 |doi= |access-date=January 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201013520/https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/CDH/article/download/46464/48492 |archive-date=February 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Concepci\u00f3n was a significant military settlement for the [[Captaincy General of Chile]], it was overrun and destroyed by [[Arauco War|Mapuche armies]] in 1554, and once again after being refounded in 1555. Concepci\u00f3n was restored during the governorship of [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]] when he landed there and built a fort on the Alto de Pinto in 1557. The town was refounded once more on January 6, 1558, by captain Jer\u00f3nimo de Villegas. It became the headquarters of the military forces engaged against the [[Mapuche]] in [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|La Araucan\u00eda]] over the next two centuries, growing to a population of 10,000 despite a [[siege]] in 1564 and other attacks by the Mapuche. Concepci\u00f3n was the home of the [[Audiencia Real|Real Audiencia]] from 1565 to 1575.\n\n[[Earthquakes]] and [[tsunamis]], which razed the town in [[1570 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|1570]], 1657, 1687, 1730 and [[1751 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|1751]], led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the [[Valle de la Mocha]], alongside the [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]]; the old site lay empty until March 29, 1842, when the present town of [[Penco]] was founded.\n\nThe new site for the town of Concepci\u00f3n became the main town of the Intendancy of Concepci\u00f3n, whose jurisdiction extended from the [[Maule River]] to La Frontera. The first Intendant of Concepci\u00f3n was the Irishman [[Ambrose O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno]], who later became [[Royal Governor of Chile]] and [[List of Viceroys of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]].\n\nWhen the First National Government Board met in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on September 18, 1810, citizens of Concepci\u00f3n joined up. Concepci\u00f3n was used as the point of entry by the Spanish Army in the attempt by the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] to re-conquer Chile. Concepci\u00f3n politicians and soldiers became a significant political force in the newly independent country.\n\nOn January 1, 1818, Ambrose O'Higgins's son, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], proclaimed and took the oath of the [[Chilean War of Independence]] in the main square of Concepci\u00f3n, which since then has been known as \"Plaza de la Independencia\". On February 20, 1835, the town again was largely destroyed by [[1835 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|an earthquake]] and had to be rebuilt.\n\nBy 1875, a key British community and German colony existed within the province.  By 1895, there was an even larger Spanish presence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmundson |first1=William |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230114838 |pages=126}}</ref>\n\nConcepci\u00f3n is the second largest city of Chile.

In May 24 of 1751 an [[1751 Concepci\u00f3n earthquake|earthquake]] followed by a [[tsunami]], ravaged the city causing serious damage, including the destruction of the library of the University and all of its funds. As a product of the fury of the waters, a rich collection of texts of the governance of southern Chile were lost, which resulted in a disaster for the culture and collective memory of the city. Due to the natural disasters, it was decided to relocate the city to the called [[Valle de la Mocha]], location where it is currently situated. Slowly the seminary was revived in the new location, in a period of decline in academic activity in Chilean monastic universities after the creation of the [[Universidad de San Felipe]], yet some degrees continued to be granted before the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1767.\nThe aforementioned University is considered to be the natural and legitimate predecessor of the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]] (UCSC), erected by the Archbishop of Concepci\u00f3n in 1991, from the [[Talcahuano]] Regional Headquarters of the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]].\n\nThe image of the Pontifical University of Concepci\u00f3n Pencopolitana, is still valid, for His Majesty [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in his 1990 speech on the occasion of his inauguration as Doctor Honoris Causa in the [[University of Chile]], in [[Santiago de Chile]], said: \"The work of the Pontifical University Pencopolitana should not be ignored, even before the creation of the University of San Felipe\" (Juan Carlos's account fails to acknowledge the existence of San Felipe's predecessor, the Dominican Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino, from the sixteenth century in Santiago).\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Chile  allowed schools in the city to teach courses in law which allowed men to obtain a law degree. Among itsstudents was Henry Urrutia Manzano, who decades later became president of the Supreme Court of Chile.\n\nThe [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]] was created in 1919 by a group of citizens including [[Enrique Molina Garmendia]], its first rector.\n\nEventually the university began to receive state support, becoming part of the [[Chilean Traditional Universities|traditional universities]], becoming one of three most important universities in the country, and the most importance at the regional level.\n\n====Traditional universities====\n* [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Universidad del B\u00edo-B\u00edo]]\n* [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda]]\n\n====Private universities====\n* [[Universidad del Desarrollo]]\n* [[Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello]]\n* [[Universidad de Artes y Ciencias Sociales|Universidad Arcis]]\n* [[Universidad San Sebasti\u00e1n]]\n* [[Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s (Chile)|Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s]]\n* [[University of the Pacific (Chile)]]\n* [[Universidad de las Am\u00e9ricas (Chile)|Universidad de Las Am\u00e9ricas]]\n* [[Universidad Bolivariana]]\n* [[Universidad Pedro de Valdivia]]\n* [[Universidad La Rep\u00fablica]]\n* [[Universidad de Aconcagua]]\n* [[:es:Inacap|Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Chile INACAP]]\n\n===Professional institutes===\n* [[Instituto Profesional DuocUC]], of the [[Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Virginio G\u00f3mez]], of the [[Universidad de Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n|Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico]], of the [[Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de la Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Santo Tom\u00e1s]], of the [[Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s (Chile)|Universidad Santo Tom\u00e1s]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional AIEP]], of the [[Universidad Andr\u00e9s Bello]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional La Araucana]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Providencia]]\n* [[Instituto de Estudios Bancarios Guillermo Subercaseaux]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Diego Portales]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Crecic]]\n* [[Instituto Profesional Placex]]\n* [[:es:Inacap|Instituto Profesional INACAP]]\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n{{expand section|date=April 2015}}\nThe city has a French international school, the ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle (Chile)|Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle]]'' and a German school, the Colegio Alem\u00e1n de Concepci\u00f3n and a British school, Saint John\u2019s School, the former located in the city downtown and the latter examples in San Pedro de la Paz. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dsc.cl/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805104650/http://www.dsc.cl/ |archive-date=2018-08-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nThe city is served by [[Carriel Sur International Airport]] in Talcahuano.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Concepci\u00f3n is classified as [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'', with a dry summer nadir in February.
