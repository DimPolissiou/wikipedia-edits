For example, both C++ and C# allow programs to define operators to convert a value from one type to another in a semantically meaningful way. When a C++ compiler encounters such a conversion, it treats the operation just like a function call. In contrast, converting a value to the C type {{mono|void*}} is an unsafe operation that is invisible to the compiler.\n\n=== Pointers ===\nSome programming languages expose [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] as if they were numeric values, and allow users to perform arithmetic on them. These languages are sometimes referred to as \"weakly typed\", since pointer arithmetic can be used to bypass the language's type system.\n\n=== Untagged unions ===\nSome programming languages support [[Union type#C++|untagged unions]], which allow a value of one type to be viewed as if it were a value of another type.\n\n=== Static type-checking ===\nIn [[Luca Cardelli]]'s article [[Typeful programming|Typeful Programming]],<ref>[http://www.lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf  Luca Cardelli, \"Typeful programming\"]</ref><!--ref>ftp://gatekeeper.research.compaq.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/SRC-045.pdf page 3</ref--> a \"strong type system\" is described as one in which there is no possibility of an unchecked runtime type error. In other writing, the absence of unchecked run-time errors is referred to as ''safety'' or ''type safety''; [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]]'s early papers call this property ''security''.<ref>Hoare, C. A. R. 1974. Hints on Programming Language Design. In ''Computer Systems Reliability'', ed. C. Bunyan. Vol. 20 pp. 505\u2013534.</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic type-checking ===\nSome programming languages do not have static type-checking. In many such languages, it is easy to write programs that would be rejected by most static type-checkers. For example, a variable might store either a number or the Boolean value \"false\".\n\n== Variation across programming languages ==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}\n\nNote that some of these definitions are contradictory, others are merely conceptually independent, and still others are special cases (with additional constraints) of other, more \"liberal\" (less strong) definitions. Because of the wide divergence among these definitions, it is possible to defend claims about most programming languages that they are either strongly or weakly typed. For instance:\n\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] require all [[Variable (programming)|variables]] to have a declared type, and support the use of explicit casts of arithmetic values to other arithmetic types. Java, C#, Ada and Pascal are sometimes said to be more strongly typed than C, a claim that is probably based on the fact that C supports more kinds of implicit conversions, and C also allows [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] values to be explicitly cast while Java and Pascal do not. Java itself may be considered more strongly typed than Pascal as manners of evading the static type system in Java are controlled by the [[Java virtual machine]]'s type system. C# and VB.NET are similar to Java in that respect, though they allow disabling of dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments in an \"unsafe context\". Pascal's type system has been described as \"too strong\", because the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks very difficult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=pascal+type+system+%22too+strong%22#v=onepage&q=pascal%20type%20system%20%22too%20strong%22&f=false|title=InfoWorld|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=1983-04-25}}</ref>\n* [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Self (programming language)|Self]] are all \"strongly typed\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime and they do little implicit [[type conversion]], but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules.  The term [[duck typing]] is now used to describe the [[dynamic typing]] paradigm used by the languages in this group.\n* The [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] family of languages are all \"strongly typed\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime. Some Lisp dialects like [[Common Lisp]] or [[Clojure]] do support various forms of type declarations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/04_.htm|title=CLHS: Chapter 4|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> and some compilers ([[CMUCL]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler.html#toc123|title=CMUCL User's Manual: The Compiler|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308055914/https://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler.html#toc123|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and related) use these declarations together with [[type inference]] to enable various optimizations and also limited forms of compile time type checks.\n* [[Standard ML]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[OCaml]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] are statically type-checked, but the compiler automatically infers a precise type for most values.\n* [[Visual Basic]] is a hybrid language. In addition to variables with declared types, it is also possible to declare a variable of \"Variant\" data type that can store data of any type. Its implicit casts are fairly liberal where, for example, one can sum string variants and pass the result into an integer variable. Visual Basic is weakly typed.\n* [[Assembly language]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] can be characterized as ''untyped''. There is no type checking; it is up to the programmer to ensure that data given to functions is of the appropriate type. Any type conversion required is explicit.\n* [[Tcl]] can be characterized as manifestly-typed:  The type of a value is derived exclusively from its representation, the assessment of which is context-dependent.\n<!-- Please do not grow this list without bound. These examples are intended to illustrate the ambiguity of the term -- NOT to advocate a particular language. Unless a language shows a DIFFERENT sort of ambiguity, please don't add it. For instance, Python is much the same as Lisp. -->\n\nFor this reason, writers who wish to write unambiguously about type systems often eschew the term \"strong typing\" in favor of specific expressions such as \"[[type safety]]\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Data type]] includes a more thorough discussion of typing issues\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Latent typing]]\n* [[Memory safety]]\n* [[Design by contract]] (strong typing as implicit contract form)\n* [[Type safety]]\n* [[Type system]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strong and Weak Typing}}\n[[Category:Type systems]]\n", "text_old": "In [[computer programming]], [[programming language]]s are often colloquially classified as to whether the language's [[type system]] makes it '''strongly typed''' or '''weakly typed''' ('''loosely typed'''). \n\nGenerally, a strongly typed language has stricter typing rules at [[compile time]], which implies that errors and exceptions are more likely to happen during compilation.

These languages are sometimes referred to as \"weakly typed\", since pointer arithmetic can be used to bypass the language's type system.\n\n=== Untagged unions ===\nSome programming languages support [[Union type#C++|untagged unions]], which allow a value of one type to be viewed as if it were a value of another type.\n\n=== Static type-checking ===\nIn [[Luca Cardelli]]'s article [[Typeful programming|Typeful Programming]],<ref>[http://www.lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf  Luca Cardelli, \"Typeful programming\"]</ref><!--ref>ftp://gatekeeper.research.compaq.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research-reports/SRC-045.pdf page 3</ref--> a \"strong type system\" is described as one in which there is no possibility of an unchecked runtime type error. In other writing, the absence of unchecked run-time errors is referred to as ''safety'' or ''type safety''; [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]]'s early papers call this property ''security''.<ref>Hoare, C. A. R. 1974. Hints on Programming Language Design. In ''Computer Systems Reliability'', ed. C. Bunyan. Vol. 20 pp. 505\u2013534.</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic type-checking ===\nSome programming languages do not have static type-checking. In many such languages, it is easy to write programs that would be rejected by most static type-checkers. For example, a variable might store either a number or the Boolean value \"false\".\n\n== Variation across programming languages ==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}\n\nNote that some of these definitions are contradictory, others are merely conceptually independent, and still others are special cases (with additional constraints) of other, more \"liberal\" (less strong) definitions. Because of the wide divergence among these definitions, it is possible to defend claims about most programming languages that they are either strongly or weakly typed. For instance:\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] require all [[Variable (programming)|variables]] to have a declared type, and support the use of explicit casts of arithmetic values to other arithmetic types. Java, C#, Ada and Pascal are sometimes said to be more strongly typed than C, a claim that is probably based on the fact that C supports more kinds of implicit conversions, and C also allows [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] values to be explicitly cast while Java and Pascal do not. Java itself may be considered more strongly typed than Pascal as manners of evading the static type system in Java are controlled by the [[Java virtual machine]]'s type system. C# and VB.NET are similar to Java in that respect, though they allow disabling of dynamic type checking by explicitly putting code segments in an \"unsafe context\". Pascal's type system has been described as \"too strong\", because the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks very difficult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7i8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=pascal+type+system+%22too+strong%22#v=onepage&q=pascal%20type%20system%20%22too%20strong%22&f=false|title=InfoWorld|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=1983-04-25}}</ref>\n* [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Self (programming language)|Self]] are all \"strongly typed\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime and they do little implicit [[type conversion]], but these languages make no use of static type checking: the compiler does not check or enforce type constraint rules.  The term [[duck typing]] is now used to describe the [[dynamic typing]] paradigm used by the languages in this group.\n* The [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] family of languages are all \"strongly typed\" in the sense that typing errors are prevented at runtime. Some Lisp dialects like [[Common Lisp]] or [[Clojure]] do support various forms of type declarations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/04_.htm|title=CLHS: Chapter 4|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> and some compilers ([[CMUCL]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler.html#toc123|title=CMUCL User's Manual: The Compiler|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308055914/https://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/compiler.html#toc123|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and related) use these declarations together with [[type inference]] to enable various optimizations and also limited forms of compile time type checks.\n* [[Standard ML]], [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]], [[OCaml]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] are statically type-checked, but the compiler automatically infers a precise type for most values.\n* [[Visual Basic]] is a hybrid language. In addition to variables with declared types, it is also possible to declare a variable of \"Variant\" data type that can store data of any type. Its implicit casts are fairly liberal where, for example, one can sum string variants and pass the result into an integer variable. Visual Basic is weakly typed.\n* [[Assembly language]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] can be characterized as ''untyped''. There is no type checking; it is up to the programmer to ensure that data given to functions is of the appropriate type. Any type conversion required is explicit.\n* [[Tcl]] can be characterized as manifestly-typed:  The type of a value is derived exclusively from its representation, the assessment of which is context-dependent.\n<!-- Please do not grow this list without bound. These examples are intended to illustrate the ambiguity of the term -- NOT to advocate a particular language. Unless a language shows a DIFFERENT sort of ambiguity, please don't add it. For instance, Python is much the same as Lisp. -->\n\nFor this reason, writers who wish to write unambiguously about type systems often eschew the term \"strong typing\" in favor of specific expressions such as \"[[type safety]]\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Data type]] includes a more thorough discussion of typing issues\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Latent typing]]\n* [[Memory safety]]\n* [[Design by contract]] (strong typing as implicit contract form)\n* [[Type safety]]\n* [[Type system]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strong and Weak Typing}}\n[[Category:Type systems]]\n", "name_user": "Comp.arch", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing"}

Tascam is credited as the inventor of the [[Portastudio]], the first cassette-based [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] home studio recorders.  Tascam also introduced the  first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync designed for recording musicians.  Tascam also manufactured [[reel-to-reel]] tape machines and audio mixers for home recordists from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tascam-16Track.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The TASCAM 85 16B analog tape recorder can record 16 tracks of audio on 1-inch (2.54cm) tape.]]\n[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early home multitrack recorder, four tracks on \u00bc inch tape]]\n\nTascam started out as a research and development group to research how to use TEAC's recording technology in musician and recording studio products.  The group was called TASC ('''T'''EAC '''A'''udio '''S'''ystems '''C'''orp).  The founders included Mr. K. Tani, one of the founders of TEAC-Japan and Dr. Abe, a senior TEAC-Japan engineer.  In 1971 TASCAM (TASC '''AM'''erica Corp.) was founded to distribute TASC products in the U.S.  It also conducted additional market research in the US for the Japanese parent company. The company's first headquarters was at 5440 McConnell Avenue, [[Los Angeles]], CA 90066.  In 1974 it moved its headquarters to 7733 Telegraph Road, Montebello, California.\n\nTascam's first products were TEAC brand multitrack recorders.  In 1972 it introduced the first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync:\n\n* The A3340 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A2340 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A3340S 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n* The A2340S 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n\nIn 1973 they introduced the first Tascam-branded products:\n\n* M-10 modular 12x4x2 mixer\n* Series 70H-X MTR\n* Series 70H-8 MTR\n\nOn March 4, 1973 TEAC merged the Tascam Corporation into TEAC Corporation of America (TCA). TEAC-Japan retains the exclusive worldwide rights to the TASCAM brand name for their professional audio related products.<ref name=\"TASCAM Forums &gt; History of TASCAM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tascamforums.com/threads/history-of-tascam.2132/ |title=A Little Tascam History Lesson |publisher=TASCAM Forums |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 [[Gibson|Gibson Brands Inc.]] bought a majority stake in [[TEAC Corporation]], the parent company of TASCAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/29/gibson-teac-purchase-idUST9N0BZ01Q20130329|title=Gibson Guitar to buy TEAC, add|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com}}</ref> In October 2017, TASCAM partnered with Philly punk band the Dead Milkmen and philanthropic record label The Giving Groove to sponsor a remix contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicconnection.com/tascam-giving-groove-milkmen-contest/|title=TASCAM Partners With The Giving Groove, Dead Milkmen for Contest|website=www.musicconnection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Notable and industry-recognized products==\n\n===[[Portastudio]] and pocketstudio===\n\n* 144 -

Tascam is credited as the inventor of the [[Portastudio]], the first cassette-based [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] home studio recorders.  Tascam also introduced the  first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync designed for recording musicians.  Tascam also manufactured [[reel-to-reel]] tape machines and audio mixers for home recordists from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tascam-16Track.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The TASCAM 85 16B analog tape recorder can record 16 tracks of audio on 1-inch (2.54cm) tape.]]\n[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early home multitrack recorder, four tracks on \u00bc inch tape]]\n\nTascam started out as a research and development group to research how to use TEAC's recording technology in musician and recording studio products.  The group was called TASC ('''T'''EAC '''A'''udio '''S'''ystems '''C'''orp).  The founders included Mr. K. Tani, one of the founders of TEAC-Japan and Dr. Abe, a senior TEAC-Japan engineer.  In 1971 TASCAM (TASC '''AM'''erica Corp.) was founded to distribute TASC products in the U.S.  It also conducted additional market research in the US for the Japanese parent company. The company's first headquarters was at 5440 McConnell Avenue, [[Los Angeles]], CA 90066.  In 1974 it moved its headquarters to 7733 Telegraph Road, Montebello, California.\n\nTascam's first products were TEAC brand multitrack recorders.  In 1972 it introduced the first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync:\n\n* The A3340 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A2340 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A3340S 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n* The A2340S 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n\nIn 1973 they introduced the first Tascam-branded products:\n\n* M-10 modular 12x4x2 mixer\n* Series 70H-X MTR\n* Series 70H-8 MTR\n\nOn March 4, 1973 TEAC merged the Tascam Corporation into TEAC Corporation of America (TCA). TEAC-Japan retains the exclusive worldwide rights to the TASCAM brand name for their professional audio related products.<ref name=\"TASCAM Forums &gt; History of TASCAM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tascamforums.com/threads/history-of-tascam.2132/ |title=A Little Tascam History Lesson |publisher=TASCAM Forums |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 [[Gibson|Gibson Brands Inc.]] bought a majority stake in [[TEAC Corporation]], the parent company of TASCAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/29/gibson-teac-purchase-idUST9N0BZ01Q20130329|title=Gibson Guitar to buy TEAC, add|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com}}</ref> In October 2017, TASCAM partnered with Philly punk band the Dead Milkmen and philanthropic record label The Giving Groove to sponsor a remix contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicconnection.com/tascam-giving-groove-milkmen-contest/|title=TASCAM Partners With The Giving Groove, Dead Milkmen for Contest|website=www.musicconnection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Notable and industry-recognized products==\n\n===[[Portastudio]] and pocketstudio===\n\n* 144 -

Griffey was a member of the famed [[Big Red Machine]], and a three-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]]. He is the father of Hall of Fame outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]]\n\n==Early life==\nGriffey was raised by a single mother of six; his father Buddy\u2014a high school teammate of another Hall of Fame outfielder, [[Stan Musial]]\u2014left the family when he was 2 years old. In a 2016 interview with [[ESPN]], he said he did not see his father again until he was 16. His contemporaries in Donora did not think he would become a baseball star; they considered his best sport to be [[American football|football]], where he was a star [[wide receiver]]. Griffey himself considered football to be his best sport, followed by [[basketball]], [[Track and field|track]], and only then baseball. At times, he would even compete in track meets during baseball games, rushing up the hill between Donora High School's baseball field and track between at-bats when it came time for his track events. However, as his high school graduation in 1969 neared, he discovered his girlfriend was pregnant. He would soon be chosen by the Reds in the 1969 draft, signed with the organization, and married his girlfriend. After his first minor-league season, Ken Jr. was born. While Ken Sr. left Donora in 1972 as his professional career advanced, he retains close ties to the town, making frequent visits to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/17121018/hall-fame-donora-pa-home-man-kid |title=Welcome to Donora, Pa.: The unlikely intersection of The Kid and Stan The Man |first=Jim |last=Caple |publisher=ESPN.com |date=July 22, 2016 |accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==MLB career==\nGriffey made his [[Major League Baseball]] debut on August 25, 1973 with the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

In [[1975 in baseball|1975]], Griffey began to break out with a .305 batting average with four home runs and 46 [[RBI]]s. Griffey's best season came in 1976, when he came just short of winning the batting title behind [[Bill Madlock]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]].

Griffey was sent to the [[New York Yankees]], where he played from 1982 to 1986 as a utility player at first base and outfield. Injuries plagued Griffey, who hit .306 with 11 homers and 46 RBIs in his best season with the Yankees. In 1986, Griffey was shipped out mid-season to the [[Atlanta Braves]], where he played for only one full season. Griffey was traded back to Cincinnati in the middle of the 1988 season. He only spent the 1989 season with the Reds, and was then released in the middle of the Reds' championship 1990 season, signing with the [[Seattle Mariners]] to conclude the season. Griffey didn't play in the 1990 World Series \u2013 but he got a ring anyway. He spent only one more season with the Mariners, in 1991, before retiring after 19 seasons.\n\nIn 1,997 games, Griffey compiled a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .296, with 152 [[home run]]s and 859 [[run batted in|RBI]].
