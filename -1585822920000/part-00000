The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe Super Netball commission announced changes to the league structure in February. Rolling [[Substitution (sport)|substitutions]] during play will be permitted, as well as during stoppages and intervals, with no limit to the number of substitutions that can be made, and multiple substitutions allowed to be made at any one time. The substitute must tag hands with the player leaving the court before entering the field of play. Extra time in the event of draws will be introduced, after six matches were tied throughout the [[2019 Suncorp Super Netball season|previous season]]. The match will enter one 5-minute period of extra time. If at the end of this period teams remain tied, the match will be declared a draw. If a team has a one-goal or greater advantage at the end of the period, they will be declared the winner. The bonus point system in place for the past two seasons will remain, though no bonus points will be awarded for goals scored in extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-rule-changes|title=Suncorp Super Netball Rule Changes|work=Super Netball|date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/6619737/harten-backs-extra-time-in-super-netball/?cs=2512|title=Harten backs extra time in Super Netball|date=6 February 2020|work=Bendigo Advertiser}}</ref>\n\n==Player transfers==\nThe league unveiled the list of non-contracted athletes on 14 August 2019, two weeks before that season's finals series were scheduled to commence.<ref name=firstlist>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|work=Super Netball|date=14 August 2019|title=Suncorp Super Netball Releases List Of Uncontracted Players|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815081204/https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|archivedate=15 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Teams had the exclusive right to re-sign any of their existing contracted players, their permanent/temporary replacement players or training partners, on single year or multi-year contracts for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.

The top four teams on the [[Standings|ladder]] at the conclusion of the [[Season (sports)#Regular season|regular season]] qualify for the [[Playoffs|finals series]]. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the [[Grand Final]]) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final.\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe Super Netball commission announced changes to the league structure in February. Rolling [[Substitution (sport)|substitutions]] during play will be permitted, as well as during stoppages and intervals, with no limit to the number of substitutions that can be made, and multiple substitutions allowed to be made at any one time. The substitute must tag hands with the player leaving the court before entering the field of play. Extra time in the event of draws will be introduced, after six matches were tied throughout the [[2019 Suncorp Super Netball season|previous season]]. The match will enter one 5-minute period of extra time. If at the end of this period teams remain tied, the match will be declared a draw. If a team has a one-goal or greater advantage at the end of the period, they will be declared the winner. The bonus point system in place for the past two seasons will remain, though no bonus points will be awarded for goals scored in extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-rule-changes|title=Suncorp Super Netball Rule Changes|work=Super Netball|date=7 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/6619737/harten-backs-extra-time-in-super-netball/?cs=2512|title=Harten backs extra time in Super Netball|date=6 February 2020|work=Bendigo Advertiser}}</ref>\n\n==Player transfers==\nThe league unveiled the list of non-contracted athletes on 14 August 2019, two weeks before that season's finals series were scheduled to commence.<ref name=firstlist>{{cite web|url=https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|work=Super Netball|date=14 August 2019|title=Suncorp Super Netball Releases List Of Uncontracted Players|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815081204/https://supernetball.com.au/news/suncorp-super-netball-releases-list-uncontracted-players|archivedate=15 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Teams had the exclusive right to re-sign any of their existing contracted players, their permanent/temporary replacement players or training partners, on single year or multi-year contracts for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.

{"title_page": "Indo-European s-mobile", "text_new": "In [[Indo-European studies]], the term '''s-''mobile''''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|o\u028a|b|\u1d7b|l|i\u02d0}}; the word is a [[Latin declension|Latin neuter adjective]]) designates the phenomenon where a [[Proto-Indo-European root|PIE root]] appears to begin with an ''{{PIE|*s-}}'' which is sometimes but not always present. It is therefore represented in the [[Reflex (linguistics)|reflex]] of the root in some attested derivatives but not others.\n\n==General description==\nThis \"movable\" prefix ''s-'' appears at the beginning of some Indo-European roots, but is absent from other occurrences of the same root.  For example, the stem ''{{PIE|*(s)t\u00e1wros}}'', perhaps 'bison', gives Latin ''taurus'' and [[Old English]] ''steor'' (Modern [[English language|English]] ''steer''), both meaning 'bull'.  Both variants existed side by side in PIE, with Germanic preserving the forms as ''*steuraz'' and ''*\u00feeuraz'' respectively, but Italic, Celtic, Slavic and others all have words for 'bull' which reflect the root without the s.  Compare also: [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''stiur'', [[German language|German]] ''Stier'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''staora'' (cattle); but [[Old Norse]] ''\u00fej\u00f3rr'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tauros'', [[Latin]] ''taurus'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''tur\u044a'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''tauras'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''tarw'', [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''tarb'', [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''turuf'' and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''taro\u00e7''.\n\nIn other cases it is Germanic which preserves only the form without the ''s'' mobile.  The root ''{{PIE|*(s)teg-}}'', 'to cover', has descendants English ''thatch'' (Old English \u00feeccan),  German ''decken'' 'cover', Latin ''teg\u014d'' 'cover', but Greek ''st\u00e9g\u014d'' and Russian ''stog''.  The fact that there is no consistency about which language groups retain the s-mobile in individual cases is good evidence that it is an original Indo-European phenomenon, and not an element added or lost in the later history of particular languages.\n\nSometimes subsequent developments can treat the forms with and without the s-mobile quite differently.  For example, by [[Grimm's law]] PIE {{PIE|*''p''}} becomes [[Proto-Germanic]] ''f'', but the combination {{PIE|*''sp''}} is unaffected by this.  Thus the root ''{{PIE|*(s)prek}}'', perhaps meaning 'scatter' has two apparently quite dissimilar derivatives in English: ''sprinkle'' (from [[nasal infix|nasalized form]] *''sprenk-'') and ''freckle'' (from *''prek-'').\n\nS-mobile is always followed by another consonant.  Typical combinations are with voiceless stops: ''{{PIE|*(s)p-}}'', ''{{PIE|*(s)t-}}'', ''{{PIE|*(s)k-}}''; with liquids and nasals: ''{{PIE|*(s)l-}}'', ''{{PIE|*(s)m-}}'', ''{{PIE|*(s)n-}}''; and rarely: ''{{PIE|*(s)w-}}''.\n\n==Origins==\nOne theory of the origin of the ''s''-mobile is that it was influenced by a suffix to the preceding word; many inflectional suffixes in PIE are reconstructed as having ended in *''s'', including the nominative singular and accusative plural of nouns. The ''s''-mobile can therefore be seen as an interference between the words, a kind of [[sandhi]] development.  So for example, while an alternation between {{PIE|*''p\u00e9\u1e31yont''}} and {{PIE|*''sp\u00e9\u1e31yont''}} (both meaning 'they saw') might be difficult to imagine, an alternation between {{PIE|*''w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7oms p\u00e9\u1e31yont''}} and {{PIE|*''w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7oms sp\u00e9\u1e31yont''}} ('they saw the wolves' <ref>Example from Andrew L. Sihler, ''New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin'', OUP 1995, p.169.</ref>) is plausible.  The two variants would still be pronounced differently, as the double -ss- is distinct from a single -s- (compare English ''the sink'' and ''this sink''), but the alternation can now be understood as a simple process of [[gemination]] (doubling) or degemination.\n\nThis can be understood in two ways.\n*Gemination (s\u2192ss): by this view, the form without the ''{{PIE|*s-}}'' is original. A habit of doubling at the join of the words causes a second -s- which is understood as part of the second word.  This is a kind of [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. Obviously this could not happen to related forms which were used in different syntactic positions, and thus the original form without the s- survives elsewhere.  This is the explanation given by [[Andrew Sihler|Sihler]].\n*Degemination (ss\u2192s): by this view, the form with the ''{{PIE|*s-}}'' is original. When it is adjacent to a noun suffix in -s, this produces a geminate. In rapid speech this is reduced to a single -s- which is understood to belong to the [[noun]], leaving the [[verb]] without its initial [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]. This explanation is more popular among linguists, for two reasons. Firstly, because a simplification of geminate ss is also observable elsewhere in the language (e.g. PIE {{PIE|*''h<sub>1</sub>\u00e9s-si''}} \u2192 {{PIE|*''h<sub>1</sub>\u00e9si''}}: see [[Indo-European copula]]). And secondly because most PIE roots beginning with the clusters sp-, st-, etc. have variants without the s-, whereas there are very many roots beginning with a simple p-, t-, etc. which have no s-mobile equivalents.  If the variants without the s- are original, we would be faced with the problem of explaining why the phenomenon was not more widespread.\n\n==Further examples==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px; background-color:#f7f8ff\" align=center cellpadding=\"7\"\n\n!||Root<ref name=\"Watkins\">{{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Calvert|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-08250-6|year=2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rix|first1=Helmut|last2=K\u00fcmmel|first2=Martin|title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben|edition=2|publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag|isbn=3-89500-219-4|oclc=47295102|language=German|year=2001|display-authors=etal}}</ref>||Meaning||Reflexes with s-||Reflexes without s-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |sk || {{PIE|*(s)kap-}} || tool || Ancient Greek ''skeparnion'' || Latin ''capus''\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)kel-}} || crooked || German ''schielen'' 'squint', Greek ''sk\u1e53l\u0113x'' 'worm' || Greek ''k\u014d\u0303lon'' 'limb'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)kep-}} || cut, scrape || English ''scab'' || [[Late Latin]] ''capulare'' 'cut'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)ker-}} || cut || English ''shear'', ''share'', Polish ''sk\u00f3ra'' 'leather' || Latin ''curtus'' 'short', Russian ''kor\u00e1'' 'cortex'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)ker-}} || bent || English ''shrink'', Avestan ''skar\u0259na'' 'round' || Latin ''curvus'' 'curved', Russian ''kriv\u2019'' 'crooked', Lithuanian ''kre\u0129vas'' 'crooked'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)kleu-}} || close || German ''schlie\u00dfen'' || Latin ''claudere''\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)k\u02b7al-o-}} || big fish || Latin ''squalus'' || English ''whale''\n|-\n|sl || {{PIE|*(s)leug-}} || to swallow || German ''schlucken'' || Old Irish ''loingid'' 'eats', Ancient Greek ''l\u00fazein'' 'hiccup', Polish ''\u0142yka\u0107'', ''po\u0142kn\u0105\u0107'' 'swallow'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |sm || {{PIE|*(s)melo-}} || small animal || English ''small'' || Dutch ''maal'' 'cow-calf', Irish ''m\u00edol'' 'animal', Russian ''m\u00e1lyj'' 'small'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)meld-}} || melt || Dutch ''smelten'' || English ''melt'', Ancient Greek ''m\u00e9ldein''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |sn || {{PIE|*(s)neh\u2082-}} || swim || [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''sn\u0101\u0301ti'', Old Irish ''sn\u00e1\u00efd'' || [[Tocharian B]] ''n\u0101ske\u1e43'' 'wash themselves'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)n\u0113g-o-}} || snake || English ''snake'' || [[Sanskrit]] ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' 'snake'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |sp || {{PIE|*(s)peik-}} || woodpecker, magpie || German ''Specht'' 'woodpecker' || Latin ''pica'' 'magpie'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)per-}} || sparrow || English ''sparrow'', Ancient Greek ''ps\u00e1r'' 'starling', Polish ''szpak'' 'starling' || Latin ''parra''\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)plei-}} || split || English ''split'', ''splinter'' || English ''flint''\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)poi-}} || foam || Latin ''spuma'' || English ''foam'', Polish ''piana'' 'foam'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |st || {{PIE|*(s)teh\u2082-}} || stand || Latin ''stare'', English ''stand'' || Irish ''t\u00e1'' 'be'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)twer-}} || whirl || English ''storm'' || Latin ''turba'' 'commotion'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)ton-}} || thunder || Greek ''stenein'' || English ''thunder'', Latin ''tonare''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |sw || {{PIE|*(s)wag\u02b0-}} || resound || English ''sough'' || Ancient Greek ''\u0113kh\u1e17'' 'sound'\n|-\n|{{PIE|*(s)wend\u02b0-}} || dwindle, wither || German ''schwinden'' 'dwindle' || Russian ''vj\u00e1nut\u2032'', ''uvjad\u00e1t\u2032'' 'wither', Polish ''wi\u0119dn\u0105\u0107'' 'wither'\n|}\n\nA number of roots beginning in {{PIE|*''sl-'', *''sm-'', *''sn-''}} look as if they had an s-mobile but the evidence is inconclusive, since several languages (Latin, Greek, Albanian) lost initial ''s-'' before [[sonorant]]s (''l, m, n'') by regular [[sound change]].

Stanford was more than 3 hours away from Fargo by flight and the maximum time a heart could remain outside the body before it ran out of oxygen, was considered around 4 hours. However, Stanford had the experience of more than 400 heart transplants by this time. The decision to bring the donor to Stanford was not possible as the donor liver was to go elsewhere. Both liver and heart teams were required to travel to Fargo and take back the donor organs to their corresponding recipients and shortly Stinson's team found themselves on a specially co-ordinated flight, complete with a \u201cred igloo Playmate [[cooler]]\u201d to Fargo\u2019s [[Hector International Airport]]. After a prolonged operation due to having to remove the liver, an aeroplane breakdown in North Dakota in extreme cold weather in the middle of the night resulted in further delay and prolonged graft anoxia. The whole time the donor heart was kept under strict low temperatures ([[hypothermia]]) in the cool box. Stinson was able to arrange from the Governor of North Dakota, [[George A. Sinner]], a [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 fighter jet]] (one of 2 stationed in the State) after surreptitiously being given his private telephone number. Further delays occurred attempting to fit the cooler in the jet. Subsequently, the donor heart was flown to Stanford on the 2-seater fighter plane with the pilot only, that is without the donor team. The total anoxic time of the donor heart (Fargo to Stanford) was just short of 8 hours, clearly missing the 4 hour window.<ref name=\"Korman1987\"/>\n\nThe story was published in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' and then picked up by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' and was published in a summarised article in February 1988 entitled \"A New Heart for Andrew\".<ref name=NewHeart1988>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qNMnAQAAIAAJ&dq=readers+digest+%22a+new+heart+for+Andrew%22&q=a+new+heart+for+Andrew%22|title=The Reader's Digest|date=1988|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|language=en}}</ref><ref name=Morken2106>{{Cite news|url=https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/30-Year-Anniversary-Heart-Transplant-399382461.html|title=30 Year Anniversary Heart Transplant|last=Morken|first=Mike|date=31 October 2016|work=Valley News Live|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDe La Pena survived Hodgkins [[Lymphoma]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]]<ref name=Morken2106/> and 32 years later, in September 2018, was reunited with the donor parents.<ref name=Inforum2018>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inforum.com/lifestyle/family/4496836-parents-worst-nightmare-turns-miracle-life-32-years-later-heart-transplant|title='A parent's worst nightmare' turns into miracle of life: 32 years later, heart transplant recipient reunites with donor's parents|last=Miller|first=John|date=9 September 2018|website=Inforum|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Research and later career==\nIn 1971, the National Institutes of Health awarded Stanford a National Institutes of Health programme project grant for further research, a venture which spanned more than twenty years.

Stanford was more than 3 hours away from Fargo by flight and the maximum time a heart could remain outside the body before it ran out of oxygen, was considered around 4 hours. However, Stanford had the experience of more than 400 heart transplants by this time. The decision to bring the donor to Stanford was not possible as the donor liver was to go elsewhere. Both liver and heart teams were required to travel to Fargo and take back the donor organs to their corresponding recipients and shortly Stinson's team found themselves on a specially co-ordinated flight, complete with a \u201cred igloo Playmate [[cooler]]\u201d to Fargo\u2019s [[Hector International Airport]]. After a prolonged operation due to having to remove the liver, an aeroplane breakdown in North Dakota in extreme cold weather in the middle of the night resulted in further delay and prolonged graft anoxia. The whole time the donor heart was kept under strict low temperatures ([[hypothermia]]) in the cool box. Stinson was able to arrange from the Governor of North Dakota, [[George A. Sinner]], a [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 fighter jet]] (one of 2 stationed in the State) after surreptitiously being given his private telephone number. Further delays occurred attempting to fit the cooler in the jet. Subsequently, the donor heart was flown to Stanford on the 2-seater fighter plane with the pilot only, that is without the donor team.

In singles, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in May 2006, reached two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005, and reached seven additional Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments. She won the Tier-I tournaments in Charleston and Berlin in 2006 as well as Tokyo 2012. In doubles, Petrova won the year-ending [[WTA Championships]] in 2004 with [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], and in 2012 with [[Maria Kirilenko]]. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===Her Early life As A Yogurt Maker===\nPetrova was born in Moscow. Her parents were both very athletic: her father Viktor was a leading hammer thrower, while her mother [[Nadezhda Ilyina]] won a bronze medal at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]] in the 400 meter relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in [[Egypt]], where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.\n\n===Playing style===\nPetrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Petrova's serve is considered her biggest asset and one of the best serves in the women's game. In 2010, she hit the most aces on the tour with 306. She had an impressive 70% of first serve points won and also won over 74% of her service games. As an accomplished doubles player, Petrova's volleying skills are considered exceptional and she is not afraid to come into the net to finish off points. Petrova's main weakness is her movement around the court as she is often slow to retrieve balls and can sometimes struggle to defend well during rallies. Also, her forehand is sometimes erratic and can produce many unforced errors. Petrova states [[hard courts]] as her preferred surface, however, she has been most successful on [[clay courts]] where she can dictate play easier because it gives her more time on the ball. She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nAs a junior, Petrova won the [[1998 French Open]], beating [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gimelstob-V. Williams halfway to grand slam|last=Smith|first=Doug|date=8 June 1998|work=USA Today |page=11C|location=McLean, Virginia}}</ref> The same year, she finished runner-up at the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to [[Elena Dementieva]] and she also finished runner-up at the junior [[1999 US Open (tennis)|1999 US Open]] to [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]]. In May 1998, she played her first WTA tournament at the [[J&S Cup]] as a wild-card entrant. She also received a wild card for her home event in Moscow, the [[Kremlin Cup]], where she picked up her first top-twenty win over [[Iva Majoli]]. By the end of 1999, Petrova had reached the top 100.\n\nIn 2000, she reached the third round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the quarterfinals of the [[Ericsson Open]], beating [[Julie Halard-Decugis]] for her first top ten win before losing to [[Lindsay Davenport]]. She finished the season at No. 50. She reached the fourth round of both [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2001 and her ranking hit a high of No. 38 during the season. However, her 2002 season was marred by injuries causing her ranking to drop out of the top 100.\n\n===2003\u20132004: First Grand Slam semifinal and top 10 ranking===\nAt the [[2003 Australian Open]], Petrova defeated [[Gr\u00e9ta Arn]] 6\u20132, 6\u20131 and then defeated 21st seed [[Ai Sugiyama]] 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the second round. Petrova then lost to world No. 15 [[Patty Schnyder]] 2\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136 in the third round.\n\nPetrova was ranked world No. 76 going into the [[2003 French Open|French Open]]. In the first round she beat the three-time champion and world No. 12 [[Monica Seles]] 6\u20134, 6\u20130, on what was to be Seles' last professional match. She then defeated [[Silvija Talaja]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 and [[Marissa Irvin]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 to reach the fourth round. Here, Petrova stunned seventh seed [[Jennifer Capriati]] 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20133. In the quarterfinals, Petrova won again in three sets over 21st seed [[Vera Zvonareva]] 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 to reach her first ever Grand Slam semifinal. Petrova faced world No. 2, [[Kim Clijsters]], and despite having a set point in the first set, Petrova was beaton in straight sets 7\u20135, 6\u20131. However, her ranking increased to world No. 30.\n\nPetrova reached the semifinals of 's Hertogenbosch, defeating [[Elena Dementieva]] en route but lost to world No. 3 [[Justine Henin]] in three sets. At the [[2003 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], Petrova was seeded 29th and made it to the third round before losing to [[Venus Williams]] 1\u20136, 2\u20136.\n\nPetrova was seeded 19th at the [[2003 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and defeated 14th seed [[Amanda Coetzer]] 6\u20130, 6\u20131 in the third round. In the fourth round, Petrova lost to third seed Lindsay Davenport 0\u20136, 7\u20136, 2\u20136.

In the fourth round, she faced unseeded [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] who just came off a win over third seed Maria Sharapova; Petrova won to reach her second quarterfinal at Wimbledon.

She too held three match points. Reza\u00ef, however, broke back, and the match was postponed due to bad light. The match was completed the following day, when Petrova won, 6\u20137, 6\u20134, 10\u20138. She continued her success in the fourth round, where she stunned the world No. 2 Venus Williams, 6\u20134, 6\u20133.

\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430}}; born 8 June 1982) is a retired [[Russians|Russian]] tennis player.\n\nIn her career, she won 37 titles on the [[WTA Tour]], 13 in singles and 24 in doubles. In singles, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3 in May 2006, reached two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005, and reached seven additional Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments. She won the Tier-I tournaments in Charleston and Berlin in 2006 as well as Tokyo 2012. In doubles, Petrova won the year-ending [[WTA Championships]] in 2004 with [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], and in 2012 with [[Maria Kirilenko]]. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nPetrova was born in Moscow. Her parents were both very athletic: her father Viktor was a leading hammer thrower, while her mother [[Nadezhda Ilyina]] won a bronze medal at the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]] in the 400 meter relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in [[Egypt]], where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.\n\n===Playing style===\nPetrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Petrova's serve is considered her biggest asset and one of the best serves in the women's game. In 2010, she hit the most aces on the tour with 306. She had an impressive 70% of first serve points won and also won over 74% of her service games. As an accomplished doubles player, Petrova's volleying skills are considered exceptional and she is not afraid to come into the net to finish off points. Petrova's main weakness is her movement around the court as she is often slow to retrieve balls and can sometimes struggle to defend well during rallies. Also, her forehand is sometimes erratic and can produce many unforced errors. Petrova states [[hard courts]] as her preferred surface, however, she has been most successful on [[clay courts]] where she can dictate play easier because it gives her more time on the ball. She is known for her unpredictability and inconsistency.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nAs a junior, Petrova won the [[1998 French Open]], beating [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gimelstob-V. Williams halfway to grand slam|last=Smith|first=Doug|date=8 June 1998|work=USA Today |page=11C|location=McLean, Virginia}}</ref> The same year, she finished runner-up at the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] to [[Elena Dementieva]] and she also finished runner-up at the junior [[1999 US Open (tennis)|1999 US Open]] to [[Lina Krasnoroutskaya]]. In May 1998, she played her first WTA tournament at the [[J&S Cup]] as a wild-card entrant. She also received a wild card for her home event in Moscow, the [[Kremlin Cup]], where she picked up her first top-twenty win over [[Iva Majoli]]. By the end of 1999, Petrova had reached the top 100.\n\nIn 2000, she reached the third round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the quarterfinals of the [[Ericsson Open]], beating [[Julie Halard-Decugis]] for her first top ten win before losing to [[Lindsay Davenport]]. She finished the season at No. 50. She reached the fourth round of both [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2001 and her ranking hit a high of No. 38 during the season. However, her 2002 season was marred by injuries causing her ranking to drop out of the top 100.\n\n===2003\u20132004: First Grand Slam semifinal and top 10 ranking===\nAt the [[2003 Australian Open]], Petrova defeated [[Gr\u00e9ta Arn]] 6\u20132, 6\u20131 and then defeated 21st seed [[Ai Sugiyama]] 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the second round.

She then defeated [[Silvija Talaja]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 and [[Marissa Irvin]] 6\u20131, 6\u20131 to reach the fourth round.

She reached her third career final at the [[Qatar Total German Open]] in May, beating [[Mary Pierce]], [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] and [[Jelena Jankovi\u0107]], before losing to Justine Henin. Her ranking rose to No. 9, where she stayed for the next two years before dropping out in May 2007.\n\nAt the [[2005 French Open|French Open]], Petrova defeated 17-year-old [[Ana Ivanovic]] in the quarterfinals before losing to Henin-Hardenne 6\u20132, 6\u20133 in the semifinals; her performance at the tournament saw her ranking rise to world No. 8. A few weeks later at [[2005 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], she reached the quarterfinals before losing to defending champion [[Maria Sharapova]] 6\u20137, 3\u20136. After Wimbledon, she reached five straight quarterfinals at [[JPMorgan Chase Open|Los Angeles]], [[Canada Masters|Toronto]], the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]].\n\nPetrova finally won her first title at the [[Generali Ladies Linz]] held in [[Linz]], Austria. She beat Patty Schnyder in the final.\nHer successful season meant she qualified for the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Los Angeles. She ended 2005 ranked world No. 9, her first top ten finish.\n\n===2006: Top-3 ranking===\nAt the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Petrova was seeded sixth and defeated [[Sophie Ferguson]], [[Martina M\u00fcller (tennis)|Martina M\u00fcller]], [[Maria Elena Camerin]], and [[Elena Vesnina]] on her way to her first quarterfinal at the Australian Open.

The victory took her ranking to No. 7. She followed it with a quarterfinal showing at the NASDAQ-100 Open, losing to Mauresmo, 3\u20136, 1\u20136.\n\nPetrova then began a run that would take her to three titles, winning fifteen straight matches. At the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]], she defeated [[Francesca Schiavone]] in the final to pick up her third title in the past six months. One week later, she won her second straight title and fourth overall at the [[Family Circle Cup]] with a victory over Patty Schnyder.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200604/s1617190.htm Petrova captures Charleston title]</ref>\n\nShe next entered the [[Qatar Telecom German Open]] in Berlin, defeating Justine Henin.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/ten/news?slug=berlintennis&prov=st&type=lgns Petrova beats Henin-Hardenne to win German Open]</ref> With this win, she ascended to her career-high ranking of No. 3.\n\nHowever, Petrova was defeated in the first round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] by [[Akiko Morigami]], 2\u20136, 2\u20136. This may have been caused by an ankle injury Petrova suffered during training for the tournament. She then withdrew from Wimbledon and did not win a match in the [[US Open Series]], going 0\u20133. At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Petrova was upset in the third round by [[Tatiana Golovin]].\n\nAt the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]], Petrova won her first tournament title since the Qatar Telecom German Open in May 2006. She then continued her return to form by reaching the final of the [[Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow, losing to Russian [[Anna Chakvetadze]].\n\nAt the [[2006 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] in Madrid in November 2006, her lone victory was over top-ranked Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, 6\u20132, 6\u20132. She finished the year at No. 6.\n\n===2007===\nAt the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she reached the third round, before falling to Serena Williams, the eventual champion, after holding a 5\u20133 lead in the second set.\n\n[[File:Nadia Petrova 2007 Australian Open R1.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Nadia Petrova at the 2007 Australian Open]]\nAt the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris, Petrova picked up her seventh tour title and first of the season by beating [[Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1]].

Petrova retired in her first\u2013round match at the [[2008 Qatar Total Open]] against [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] due to an upset stomach while trailing 2\u20136, 2\u20131. At [[2008 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], she lost 4\u20136, 4\u20136 to [[Katarina Srebotnik]].\n\nPetrova's injuries continued to strike -when she was forced to retire in the second round of Miami with a right quad strain while trailing 1\u20132 in the first set against [[Zheng Jie]].\n\nAt the [[2008 German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, Petrova returned to action as the 16th seed and defeated Katarina Srebotnik, 7\u20136, 3\u20136, 7\u20136, in the first round, before losing in the second round to Maria Kirilenko, 3\u20136, 3\u20136.

She was beaten in a close match by Pole Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, 4\u20136, 7\u20136, 4\u20136.\n\nAt Wimbledon, Petrova was 21st seed and was on track after wins over [[Olga Govortsova]] and [[Mara Santangelo]]. Petrova then pulled off an excellent win over the in-form teenager and 16th seed [[Victoria Azarenka]] in the third round. In the fourth round, she faced unseeded [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] who just came off a win over third seed Maria Sharapova; Petrova won to reach her second quarterfinal at Wimbledon. This was also the first time that Petrova had reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2006 Australian Open. She lost a cracker two and a half hour marathon match against the fifth seed Elena Dementieva, 1\u20136, 7\u20136, 3\u20136.

After easy wins over [[Galina Voskoboeva]], [[Julie Ditty]], and [[Lilia Osterloh]], Petrova once again found herself up against Maria Kirilenko for a place in the final. This time though, Petrova was victorious, coming back from a set down to win, 1\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20131. Petrova then thrashed [[Nathalie Dechy]], 6\u20132, 6\u20131, in the final to win her first title of the year and the eighth of her career.\n\n[[File:Nadia-petrova.png|thumb|right|Nadia Petrova at the 2008 US Open]]\nPetrova was in good form heading into the final Grand Slam tournament of the year at the US Open.

At [[2008 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]], she reached her third final of the season, after an impressive run, beating [[Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1]], Patty Schnyder, [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]], and Victoria Azarenka in straight sets. She failed to win the title, this time losing to Jelena Jankovi\u0107, the world No. 2, 4\u20136, 3\u20136. Despite not winning the title, Petrova's ranking moved back into the top 15 to world No. 14 as a result of reaching the final.\n\nPetrova was a quarterfinalist at her home event, the [[2008 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow, beating teenager [[Caroline Wozniacki]], before losing to compatriot and third seed Elena Dementieva, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20137.

This title also secured her status as the second alternate for the Tour Championships should a player withdraw. This did indeed happen, and Petrova came in replacing Serena Williams. She lost her only match to Dementieva, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 4\u20136.\n\nPetrova finished the 2008 season ranked world No. 11.\n\n===2009===\nPetrova started 2009 playing at the [[2009 Medibank International Sydney|Medibank International Sydney]], where she was seeded seventh.

She was unable to defend her title, losing in the first round to Alona Bondarenko, 2\u20136, 3\u20136. This caused her ranking to slip out of the top 10 to world No. 12. Petrova next played in [[2009 Rogers Cup|Toronto]] as the tenth seed, where her poor form continued as she fell again to Maria Sharapova in the first round.
