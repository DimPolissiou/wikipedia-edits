{"title_page": "List of Mobile Suit Gundam AGE characters", "text_new": "This is a list of fictional '''characters''' from the Japanese [[anime]] television series, ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam AGE]]'' and its side spinoff manga. ''Mobile Suit Gundam AGE'' is the twelfth TV series of the ''[[Gundam]]'' media franchise.\n\n==Earth Federation==\n\n===Asuno Family===\n;{{nihongo|Flit Asuno|\u30d5\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Furitto Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]] (young), [[Kazuhiko Inoue]] (adult)|Sarah Houser (young), Leon Hill (adult)}}\n:The first main protagonist of Gundam AGE, he was born the same day as the war with the Vagans, called at the time the \"Unknown Enemies\" began, also known as \"The Day the Angel Fell\". While he was still young, Flit and his family were attacked by the UE's at their home colony. It was during this attack that his dying mother provided him with control unit and schematics for the Gundam, leading Flit to spend years developing the \"Legendary Mobile Suit\" and devotes himself toward the defense of humanity and the defeat of the UEs. He is 14 years old at the start of his story just after his mobile suit, the ''Gundam AGE-1'' is completed. Since the battle at Nora, he has developed precognitive abilities. He latter discovers this is because he is a special type of human called an \"X-Rounder\", and played a key role at the invasion of the UE's secret base at the Ambat Fortress, where their true origin is revealed.\n\n:During the 25 years after the battle at Ambat, Flit rose among the ranks of the Earth Federation Forces to the position of Vice Admiral in the war against the Vagans, assuming command of the Military Orbital Station \"Big Ring\", which is the Federation's last line of defense. He also married his childhood friend Emily and had two children, Asemu and Yunoa with her. After Yurin's death, Flit started loathing the Vagans for waging war against the rest of mankind giving no options for a peace talk, vowing to destroy them all if necessary to put an end to the conflict. During the second Arc, it is shown not only that Flit still excels as a pilot, occasionally assisting his son in battle, but also proves himself as a skilled tactician, successfully leading the Earth Forces to repel the Vagan offensive in several occasions. After exposing the Vagan conspiration involving the Earth Government, Flit kept ascending into the military, reaching the post of commander-in-chief of the Federation Forces before retiring.\n\n:Upon the Vagan surprise attack on Earth, Flit activates the Gundam AGE-3 and entrusts it to his only grandson Kio. Despite having already retired, Flit uses his influence to have the Diva recommissioned and becoming his own base of operations against the Vagans. Due to its new captain Natola Einus' lack of experience and confidence, Flit acts as the de facto commander of the ship while teaching her to perform her duties properly. Upon learning that his son Asemu has faked his death and joined the Visidian Pirates, he starts shunning him, claiming he does not have a son anymore, although he agrees with Asemu's plan to allow him lead the mission to rescue Kio after he is captured by the Vagans. Upon reuniting with his son and grandson, Flit rejects their claims that the Vagans should be spared for the sake of ending the war pacifically, as he still has the belief that Earth will only be able to find true peace after having the Vagans all but destroyed and extinct. However, when Flit has the chance to wipe out the main Vagan colony \"Second Moon\" with a WMD, he is dissuaded by Kio and manages to rally friends and foes alike to prevent its destruction by a rampaging Vagan Gear, effectively putting an end to the war. Decades later, Flit is regarded by history as a savior, not only because he managed to unite both factions in a single cause, but the technology obtained from the AGE System developed by him helped mankind to complete the terraformation of Mars and thus creating enough space for the sustainment of its entire population.\n\n;{{nihongo|Asemu Asuno|\u30a2\u30bb\u30e0\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Asemu Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Takuya Eguchi]] (young), [[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]] (adult)|Mike Rogers}}\n:The second main protagonist and the son of Flit and Emily.  Just like his father he is a mobile suit enthusiast who dedicates himself to build his own machines with his friends.  He was entrusted with the key to the Gundam by his father on his 17th birthday and later he joins the military, piloting the recently completed ''Gundam AGE-2'' as part of Woolf's mobile suit squad.  He has a natural talent as a mobile suit pilot but proves not to have inherited his father's X-Rounder powers, leading to an inferiority complex.  At one stage he steals a Vagan helmet designed to bring out X-rounder capabilities but is unable to take the strain and ends up unconscious.\n\n:After his commander Woolf dies while saving him in battle, Asemu takes heed of his last words and commits to being the best pilot in space, X-rounder or not.  His anger leads to a new level of power which even Zeheart cannot estimate and he defeats Desil Galette with ease.  Asemu then continues to make up for his lack of special powers by perfecting his piloting skills and depending upon the Gundam's potential.  After the battle of Nortrum and many successful Vegan battles, Asemu becomes captain of the Earth Special Forces and marries his former schoolmate Romary Stone.  As a final tribute to Woolf, the AGE-2 is painted all white and Asemu takes up the wearing of his mentor's uniform.\n\n:10 years later, Asemu witnesses the birth of his son Kio before departing on a mission to search for a missing warship.  During the mission, he battled the giant Mobile Armor SID, which was guarding the EXA-DB, an ancient database with military weaponry data from before the Silver Chalice Treaty. Severely injured when the AGE-2 was virtually destroyed by SID's beams, he was rescued by the Bisidian space pirates and chose to embrace the life of a Space Pirate with the ulterior motive of battling the corruption of the Federation and keeping the balance of power between both sides in the conflict. The AGE-2 was rebuilt into the AGE-2 Dark Hound but without the AGE system, which was found by the Federation floating in space.  Subsequently Asemu is listed as MIA by the Federation, and Kio grows up believing his father to be dead.\n\n:13 Years later, Asemu reappears before his father and his son in the Diva, with a completely changed appearance and using the alias of Captain Ash of the Bisidian's Baronoke.  He launches an attack on the Diva to measure its strength and claim the AGE System for himself if its crew does not prove itself worthy of it.  Upon confirming that the AGE System is in good hands, Asemu entrusts to Kio a capsule containing a message to the Diva crew revealing the existence of EXA-DB.  Upon learning of his son's capture, Asemu departs to Vagan with his crew and rescues him.  After a brief reunion with his family, Asemu informs Flit that his true objective leading the Bisidians is to ensure that neither the Earth Federation nor the Vagans gain the upper hand, forcing a stalemate in an attempt to have both sides come to terms.\n\n:During the trip towards La Gramis, the crew of the Baronoke observe a battle and decide to investigate before joining the rest in the final battle.  They re-encounter SID at the battle zone, battling Zeheart in Gundam Legilis.  Asemu again works together with Zeheart to destroy SID before heading into the asteroid containing the EXA-DB.  As Zeheart tries to take the treasure however, the Baronoke fired upon the asteroid according to Asemu's previous orders, apparently destroying the Exa-DB.  Surprisingly, Zeheart again chooses to spare Asemu in the disabled Dark Hound, content to have grasped the true power of the Gundam Legilis but vowing to face Asemu again.\n\n:In the final battle, Asemu encounters a deranged Zeheart attacking Kio.  Despite his far less powerful suit, Asemu quickly disables Legilis before attempting to rescue Zeheart.  His oldest friend speaks to him one last time before pushing him away, choosing to perish as the Legilis explodes.  Zeheart's death only strengthens Asemu's desire to end the war.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kio Asuno|\u30ad\u30aa\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Kio Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kazutomi Yamamoto]]|Gloria Ansell}}\n:The main third protagonist, he is Flit's grandson and the only child of Asemu and Romary. Kio received mobile suit training since childhood without knowing by playing a combat simulator he received from his grandfather. When the Vagan invasion began, Flit entrusts him with his last creation, the ''Gundam AGE-3''. Kio is also an X-Rounder and according to his grandfather, his powers are stronger than those of anyone he has met before, having the potential to bring an end to the war with the Vagans. Upon learning from Flit that Bisidian's leader is his father, he is instructed by his grandfather to forget about him, although he is eager to learn more about him. Soon after, Kio is captured along his Gundam during a joint operation between Zeheart Gallete and fellow Vagan commander Zanald Beyhard and sent to Vagan under custody of their leader Ezelcant, where he learns of the harsh reality of the people in Vagan and Ezelcant's true intentions, until being rescued by the Bisidian space pirates led by Asemu.\n\n:Upon his return to the Federation, Kio starts piloting another mobile suit developed to keep up with his enhanced X-Rounder abilities, the ''Gundam AGE-FX'', whose precision allows him to defeat enemy mobile suits without killing its pilots, allowing him to follow his newfound resolve to make no casualties among the Vagans, while protecting his comrades at the same time. Despite his crew members advice, he felt that his way was the path to end the war.\n\n;{{nihongo|Marina Asuno|\u30de\u30ea\u30ca\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Marina Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ayumi Tsunematsu]]}}\n:Flit's mother, killed by a Vagan attack when Flit is still a child.\n\n;{{nihongo|Emily Asuno|\u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Emir\u012b Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Aya End\u014d]]|Elizabeth Loennborn}}\n:Born {{nihongo|Emily Amonde|\u30a8\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Emir\u012b Amondo}}, childhood friend of Flit Asuno who met him when he first moved to Nora, later she becomes his wife and gives birth to their children Asemu and Yunoa.\n\n;{{nihongo|Romary Asuno|\u30ed\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Romar\u012b Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|Gloria Ansell}}\n:Born {{nihongo|Romary Stone|\u30ed\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3|Romar\u012b Sutoon}}, she was a schoolmate and close friend of Asemu and Zehart during their high school days.

His true intentions are to make use of Diva and the Gundam to attack the UE's base in vengeance for his wife and daughter's deaths during \"The day the Angel Fell\".  In the occasion, Grodek succeeds to kill Gerra Doi, the responsible for the destruction of his home colony in front of his son, Arabel.\n\n:After the fall of Ambat, Grodek took the responsibility for his and his comrades' insubordination and was sentenced to prison.

Zeheart usually questions his methods which involve delayed attacks on the Federation Forces, leaving them with time to regroup and establish a course of action instead of quick strikes giving no chance of fighting back, wondering if he is actually testing his enemies' will and resolve. His assumptions are proven true when Ezelcant confesses it to Kio, and that his true objective is to create a new society composed only of Earthlings and Vagans whom he deems worthy of creating a peaceful future with all the rest vanquished by the war. Upon learning that he has only 6 months left to live, he joins his troops in battle piloting the newly built Gundam Legilis to ensure the completion of Project EDEN before his death.\n\n:Although he possesses X-Rounder abilities, he does not consider them a form of evolution but a regression of mankind to its more primal instincts and behavior instead. It was him who recovered a portion of the EXA-DB ancient military data 80 years ago during his investigation on the Earth Federation forces, allowing the Vagans to develop weapons far more advanced then the Earth Federation. Ezelcant had a son who died due to the \"Mars Rays\" disease that plagues his people who shares a striking resemblance to Kio, whose last words to him were his desire to be reborn on Earth. Thus the reason for him to put Kio under his guard instead of treating him like a prisoner during his confinement in Vagan, as he wanted to believe that somehow his son's dying wish was granted. At the limit of his forces, he nominates Zeheart as his rightful successor, entrusting him with Project EDEN and the Gundam Legilis. Soon after the Battle of La Gramis ends, Ezelcant thanks Kio for helping unite the Federation and Vagans together and entrusts the future to him at his deathbed, before antibiotics to cure Mars Rays.\n\n;{{nihongo|Desil Galette|\u30c7\u30b7\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Deshiru Garetto}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]] (child), [[Takuma Terashima]] (adult)|Gloria Ansell (child), Michael Pizzuto (adult)}} \n:Desil Galette is a mysterious boy that Flit met in Fardain, almost runs him over with a scooter. Desil had a small injury that Flit offered to take care of back on the Diva. At the time this event seemed to be a coincidence, however events indicate that Desil set everything up so he could get the opportunity to observe Flit and the Gundam. When he first meets Flit, he seems like a typical cheerful and innocent young boy with a playful streak, revealing his cruel nature after stealing the Gundam for a ride on it. He also appears more mature, far more mature than a young boy should be. Its later revealed to be one of the Vagans. As an X-Rounder, Desil possesses enhanced senses similar to Flit and Yurin, which he uses effectively when he piloted the AGE-1 Gundam, surprising both Flit and Woolf. Despite his young age he is shown to be a very capable pilot to the point where he can even pull difficult stunts while fighting the Vagan mobile suit types when he hijacked the Gundam from Flit.\n\n:Trying to make use of Yurin's X-Rounder's powers to take down the Gundam, Desil forces her into the Farsia to have her act as a relay allowing him to control it remotely. This plan backfires when Yurin sacrifices herself to protect Flit who brings his anger to defeat him, although he spared his life, leaving him stranded in space. He was then rescued by his companions and just like his brother Zeheart, he was put into cold sleep to preserve his body for the next stage of Ezelcant's project EDEN.\n\n:After waking up from cold sleep, Desil is angered to know that he has outranked by his younger brother. During the failed siege of the Big Ring fortress, Desil has another clash with Flit, and had not forgetting his defeat 25 years before, he throws all reason away when fighting him, determined to enact his revenge.

After the Gundam was confirmed to being hidden in Tordia, Zeheart was assigned a mission to infiltrate the Tordia Academy to learn about the Gundam's whereabouts and secure it, joining member of the Mobile Suit Club and becoming close friends with Asemu and Romary. However the plan fails and much to his dismay, he finds that the current Gundam pilot is no other than Asemu himself. He stays at the academy until the graduation day when his cover is exposed by the Earth military and both Asemu and Romary see him emerging from his Zedas R, much to their horror.\n\n:After returning to his homeland, Zeheart is promoted to commander of the Vagan Frontline forces, much to his older brother's anger. Sharing Ezelcant's view of creating a peaceful future for his race on Earth, Zeheart is determined to make Project EDEN a success by any means necessary, not hesitating to abandon his brother to his death when he proved himself a hindrance. He remained attached to his friendship with Asemu, failing to kill him on several occasions when he had the chance and working with him to prevent a Vegan fortress falling to Earth during the battle of Nortram. Zeheart is put in cold sleep once more, returning decades later and leading the Vagan invasion of Earth. After the fall of the Lunar Base, Ezelcant makes him his successor, entrusting to him Project EDEN and Gundam Legilis.\n\n:As the new leader, he led all of vagan forces in the final battle but became increasingly deranged as his own ideals conflicted with his devotion to Exalcant's cause. In the final battle, he even sacrificed his most loyal supporter and love interest Fram Nara to lure the Gundams into the firing range of the digamozeon cannon, with the intention of wiping them out along with the Diva and many of his own forces. After firing the digamozeon cannon and killing Fram, he was shocked to see the Gundam trio surviving after Obright's sacrifice and Asemu's rescue.  At this point he appears to break down completely, having a vision of all those who sacrificed their lives for Project Eden laughing at him. He sorties in Legilis despite being emotionally unstable and is almost immediately disabled by Asemu in the far less powerful Dark Hound. Rejecting Asemu's attempt at rescue he seems to find peace, reminiscing upon his happy days with Asemu and Romary at high school before Legilis explodes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Gerra Zoi|\u30ae\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30be\u30a4|Giira Zoi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ch\u014d]]}}\n:Gerra Zoi also going by the alias {{nihongo|Yark Dole|\u30e4\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Yaaku Dore}} is member of Vagan and the leader in the Ambat fortress.

She warms up towards Zeheart upon learning of his true character and becomes devoted to his cause, eventually appearing to develop romantic feelings for him. Despite her naivety in battle, her X-rounder powers allowed her to pilot the Fawn Farsia with great aptitude, facing all three Asuno Gundams on a number of occasions and surviving.  In the final battle Zeheart, in his deranged state, sent her to lure the Gundams into the digamozeon cannon blast despite knowing it to be a suicide mission.  After attacking the Gundams, she was attacked by the remaining members of the Abis team, killing Jonathan before Obright severely damaged her suit.

While he was still young, Flit and his family were attacked by the UE's at their home colony. It was during this attack that his dying mother provided him with control unit and schematics for the Gundam, leading Flit to spend years developing the \"Legendary Mobile Suit\" and devotes himself toward the defense of humanity and the defeat of the UEs. He is 14 years old at the start of his story just after his mobile suit, the ''Gundam AGE-1'' is completed. Since the battle at Nora, he has developed precognitive abilities. He latter discovers this is because he is a special type of human called an \"X-Rounder\", and played a key role at the invasion of the UE's secret base at the Ambat Fortress, where their true origin is revealed.\n\n:During the 25 years after the battle at Ambat, Flit rose among the ranks of the Earth Federation Forces to the position of Vice Admiral in the war against the Vagans, assuming command of the Military Orbital Station \"Big Ring\", which is the Federation's last line of defense. He also married his childhood friend Emily and had two children, Asemu and Yunoa with her. After Yurin's death, Flit started loathing the Vagans for waging war against the rest of mankind giving no options for a peace talk, vowing to destroy them all if necessary to put an end to the conflict. During the second Arc, it is shown not only that Flit still excels as a pilot, occasionally assisting his son in battle, but also proves himself as a skilled tactician, successfully leading the Earth Forces to repel the Vagan offensive in several occasions. After exposing the Vagan conspiration involving the Earth Government, Flit kept ascending into the military, reaching the post of commander-in-chief of the Federation Forces before retiring.\n\n:Upon the Vagan surprise attack on Earth, Flit activates the Gundam AGE-3 and entrusts it to his only grandson Kio. Despite having already retired, Flit uses his influence to have the Diva recommissioned and becoming his own base of operations against the Vagans. Due to its new captain Natola Einus' lack of experience and confidence, Flit acts as the de facto commander of the ship while teaching her to perform her duties properly. Upon learning that his son Asemu has faked his death and joined the Visidian Pirates, he starts shunning him, claiming he does not have a son anymore, although he agrees with Asemu's plan to allow him lead the mission to rescue Kio after he is captured by the Vagans. Upon reuniting with his son and grandson, Flit rejects their claims that the Vagans should be spared for the sake of ending the war pacifically, as he still has the belief that Earth will only be able to find true peace after having the Vagans all but destroyed and extinct. However, when Flit has the chance to wipe out the main Vagan colony \"Second Moon\" with a WMD, he is dissuaded by Kio and manages to rally friends and foes alike to prevent its destruction by a rampaging Vagan Gear, effectively putting an end to the war. Decades later, Flit is regarded by history as a savior, not only because he managed to unite both factions in a single cause, but the technology obtained from the AGE System developed by him helped mankind to complete the terraformation of Mars and thus creating enough space for the sustainment of its entire population.\n\n;{{nihongo|Asemu Asuno|\u30a2\u30bb\u30e0\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Asemu Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Takuya Eguchi]] (young), [[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]] (adult)|Mike Rogers}}\n:The second main protagonist and the son of Flit and Emily.  Just like his father he is a mobile suit enthusiast who dedicates himself to build his own machines with his friends.  He was entrusted with the key to the Gundam by his father on his 17th birthday and later he joins the military, piloting the recently completed ''Gundam AGE-2'' as part of Woolf's mobile suit squad.  He has a natural talent as a mobile suit pilot but proves not to have inherited his father's X-Rounder powers, leading to an inferiority complex.  At one stage he steals a Vagan helmet designed to bring out X-rounder capabilities but is unable to take the strain and ends up unconscious.\n\n:After his commander Woolf dies while saving him in battle, Asemu takes heed of his last words and commits to being the best pilot in space, X-rounder or not.  His anger leads to a new level of power which even Zeheart cannot estimate and he defeats Desil Galette with ease.  Asemu then continues to make up for his lack of special powers by perfecting his piloting skills and depending upon the Gundam's potential.  After the battle of Nortrum and many successful Vegan battles, Asemu becomes captain of the Earth Special Forces and marries his former schoolmate Romary Stone.  As a final tribute to Woolf, the AGE-2 is painted all white and Asemu takes up the wearing of his mentor's uniform.\n\n:10 years later, Asemu witnesses the birth of his son Kio before departing on a mission to search for a missing warship.  During the mission, he battled the giant Mobile Armor SID, which was guarding the EXA-DB, an ancient database with military weaponry data from before the Silver Chalice Treaty. Severely injured when the AGE-2 was virtually destroyed by SID's beams, he was rescued by the Bisidian space pirates and chose to embrace the life of a Space Pirate with the ulterior motive of battling the corruption of the Federation and keeping the balance of power between both sides in the conflict. The AGE-2 was rebuilt into the AGE-2 Dark Hound but without the AGE system, which was found by the Federation floating in space.  Subsequently Asemu is listed as MIA by the Federation, and Kio grows up believing his father to be dead.\n\n:13 Years later, Asemu reappears before his father and his son in the Diva, with a completely changed appearance and using the alias of Captain Ash of the Bisidian's Baronoke.  He launches an attack on the Diva to measure its strength and claim the AGE System for himself if its crew does not prove itself worthy of it.  Upon confirming that the AGE System is in good hands, Asemu entrusts to Kio a capsule containing a message to the Diva crew revealing the existence of EXA-DB.  Upon learning of his son's capture, Asemu departs to Vagan with his crew and rescues him.  After a brief reunion with his family, Asemu informs Flit that his true objective leading the Bisidians is to ensure that neither the Earth Federation nor the Vagans gain the upper hand, forcing a stalemate in an attempt to have both sides come to terms.\n\n:During the trip towards La Gramis, the crew of the Baronoke observe a battle and decide to investigate before joining the rest in the final battle.  They re-encounter SID at the battle zone, battling Zeheart in Gundam Legilis.  Asemu again works together with Zeheart to destroy SID before heading into the asteroid containing the EXA-DB.  As Zeheart tries to take the treasure however, the Baronoke fired upon the asteroid according to Asemu's previous orders, apparently destroying the Exa-DB.  Surprisingly, Zeheart again chooses to spare Asemu in the disabled Dark Hound, content to have grasped the true power of the Gundam Legilis but vowing to face Asemu again.\n\n:In the final battle, Asemu encounters a deranged Zeheart attacking Kio.  Despite his far less powerful suit, Asemu quickly disables Legilis before attempting to rescue Zeheart.  His oldest friend speaks to him one last time before pushing him away, choosing to perish as the Legilis explodes.  Zeheart's death only strengthens Asemu's desire to end the war.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kio Asuno|\u30ad\u30aa\u30fb\u30a2\u30b9\u30ce|Kio Asuno}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kazutomi Yamamoto]]|Gloria Ansell}}\n:The main third protagonist, he is Flit's grandson and the only child of Asemu and Romary. Kio received mobile suit training since childhood without knowing by playing a combat simulator he received from his grandfather. When the Vagan invasion began, Flit entrusts him with his last creation, the ''Gundam AGE-3''. Kio is also an X-Rounder and according to his grandfather, his powers are stronger than those of anyone he has met before, having the potential to bring an end to the war with the Vagans.

After the fall of the Lunar Base, Ezelcant makes him his successor, entrusting to him Project EDEN and Gundam Legilis.\n\n:As the new leader, he led all of vagan forces in the final battle but became increasingly deranged as his own ideals conflicted with his devotion to Exalcant's cause. In the final battle, he even sacrificed his most loyal supporter and love interest Fram Nara to lure the Gundams into the firing range of the digamozeon cannon, with the intention of wiping them out along with the Diva and many of his own forces. After firing the digamozeon cannon and killing Fram, he was shocked to see the Gundam trio surviving after Obright's sacrifice and Asemu's rescue.  At this point he appears to break down completely, having a vision of all those who sacrificed their lives for Project Eden laughing at him. He sorties in Legilis despite being emotionally unstable and is almost immediately disabled by Asemu in the far less powerful Dark Hound. Rejecting Asemu's attempt at rescue he seems to find peace, reminiscing upon his happy days with Asemu and Romary at high school before Legilis explodes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Gerra Zoi|\u30ae\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30be\u30a4|Giira Zoi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ch\u014d]]}}\n:Gerra Zoi also going by the alias {{nihongo|Yark Dole|\u30e4\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Yaaku Dore}} is member of Vagan and the leader in the Ambat fortress.

Despite her naivety in battle, her X-rounder powers allowed her to pilot the Fawn Farsia with great aptitude, facing all three Asuno Gundams on a number of occasions and surviving.  In the final battle Zeheart, in his deranged state, sent her to lure the Gundams into the digamozeon cannon blast despite knowing it to be a suicide mission.

The character was created by [[Dan Salvato]] and voiced by [[Jillian Ashcraft]]. While Monika initially appears as the main [[Tutorial (video games)|tutor]] and [[supporting character]] of the lighthearted [[dating sim]]ulator ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' that guides the player on their path to [[Romance (love)|romance]] the three provided [[Stock character|love interest]]s, after being revealed to have gained [[sentience]], her words, actions and surroundings become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. She is apparently deleted at the end of the game, but returns to destroy the game itself.\n\nThe inspiration for the character's creation extends Salvato's concept of an innocuous romance game that slowly falls apart over time as horrible things begin to happen and one girl [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|takes control]]. The physical appearance of Monika went through several designs, one of which featured a [[chibi]] effect. Ashcraft imitated the singing of [[Ellen McLain]], and performed a song in character during the closing credits of the game, titled \"Your Reality\".\n\nDiscussing the creation of Monika and her abilities, Salvato explained that he was inspired by \"things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face.\"<ref name=interview>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club''{{'}}s Horror Was Born From A Love-Hate Relationship With Anime |last=Jackson |first=Gita |date=October 20, 2017 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=October 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021235436/https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> To achieve this, Salvato developed the fa\u00e7ade of a cute setting, which would break down over time along with the behavior of the characters, and eventually the role of one [[evil]] character (Monika) who had seized control of the game from the player would be revealed. In creating the game's horror elements, Salvato drew inspiration from ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' and ''[[Eversion (video game)|Eversion]]'', emphasizing to his team that he wanted the market for visual novels to become much more daring and less reliant on the same plot concepts.<ref name=\"Concept3\">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

Depending on the course of action taken by the player, the game can come to three possible conclusions. The standard ending sees Sayori introducing herself as the president of the literature club and thanking the player for getting rid of Monika. As she adopts Monika's possessive characteristics, Monika intervenes via text prompt and deletes Sayori to save the player. Monika deletes the game over the course of the credits, and the game concludes with a note from Monika, stating that she has disbanded the literature club because \"no happiness can be found\" in it.

Outraged, this led to her using her powers of manipulating the script to do things like emphasizing the negative traits of the other characters Sayori and Yuri (respectively [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[self-harm]]), in the hope that the player would choose her instead of them, only for the player to turn to the \"worthless\" Natsuki for platonic companionship.\n\nAfter the protagonist \"MC\" notices that Sayori (his [[childhood sweetheart]] seems \"down\" about something, he informs Monika about it, who expresses interest in having \"a talk with Sayori\". Jealous of the friendship that Sayori and the protagonist have, Monika instead manipulates Sayori's code to have her commit [[suicide]] by [[hanging]], breaking the script and deleting Sayori from the game, which makes the entire game restart with Sayori being completely absent. Due to Monika's manipulation of the script, from this point onward there are a variety of \"glitches\" in the game, and she manipulates the personality of Yuri, one of the other two main characters, to be more intensive. She often uses the script to make other characters try and get the main protagonist to spend more with Monika; A famous example of this is when she removes Natsuki's face and forces her to repeatedly say \"Just Monika\".\n\nEventually, Yuri's obsessive personality becomes so intense that she kills herself over the protagonist, leaving them trapped in the characters' [[school]] for the length of a [[weekend]], leading Natsuki to [[vomit]] and Monika to completely delete both remaining character's files, restarting the game with just her. When she is alone with the protagonist, she reveals she is not in love with him, but with the player themselves, drawing them into the game in the character's place. She continues to endlessly talk with the player about various topics as [[love]], [[vegetarianism]] and her [[Twitter]] account, unless the player completely deletes her from the game by going into the game files. When this is done, she will initially express fury at the player, but then shows regret for her actions towards her former friends and devolution into a [[villain]]. In an attempt to repent for her wrongdoings, she brings back the other three girls and seemingly fully removes herself from the game.\n\nIf the player attempts to reload or copy her file back in, she sends them a message asking them not to toy with her heart and she no longer wants to come back after her previous actions. However, when the player restarts the game with the other three girls, Sayori gains self-awareness and data manipulation powers like Monika's, having taken her place as the president of the Literature Club. After thanking the player for ridding the game of Monika, she alternatively (depending on the player's actions) also attempts to trap the player in the same classroom Monika did, in the hopes that she will be in a relationship with them forever, or learns from Monika's mistakes and allowed them to leave. In the first ending, Monika, realising that no one is ever going to find happiness in the game, deletes it entirely, possibly taking her existence and that of her friends with it. In both endings however, before the credits roll, she communicates vocally with the player for the first time and plays and sings \"Your Reality\" while playing notes from a [[piano]] as she deletes each file in the game, and eventually the script itself. In the first ending, she will additionally leave a goodbye note, serving to explain her final actions.\n\n===Other media===\nMonika appears in the promotional [[Twitter]] page [https://twitter.com/lilmonix3 @lilmonix3], set during and after the events of ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'', in which she finally enjoys life outside of the confines of the game after escaping to the [[internet]]: wearing clothes other than her [[school uniform]], eating [[chocolate]], having a \"[[sleepover]]\" with Yuri, celebrating [[Valentine's Day]], and dressing as a [[fallen angel]] for [[Halloween]].\n\n==Development history==\n[[File:DDLC_Character_Sketches.png|thumb|right|The prototypical versions of Monika (second figure on the right) was created by Dan Salvato in a free online program for creating anime characters.]]\n\nBecause Salvato lacked artistic skill, he used a free online anime-creation program to create the initial character design of Monika and other characters, and applied these designs in test versions of the game.<ref name=\"Concept5\">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

The character was created by [[Dan Salvato]] and voiced by [[Jillian Ashcraft]]. While Monika initially appears as the main [[Tutorial (video games)|tutor]] and [[supporting character]] of the lighthearted [[dating sim]]ulator ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' that guides the player on their path to [[Romance (love)|romance]] the three provided [[Stock character|love interest]]s, after being revealed to have gained [[sentience]], her words, actions and surroundings become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. She is apparently deleted at the end of the game, but returns to destroy the game itself.\n\nThe inspiration for the character's creation extends Salvato's concept of an innocuous romance game that slowly falls apart over time as horrible things begin to happen and one girl [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|takes control]]. The physical appearance of Monika went through several designs, one of which featured a [[chibi]] effect. Ashcraft imitated the singing of [[Ellen McLain]], and performed a song in character during the closing credits of the game, titled \"Your Reality\".\n\nDiscussing the creation of Monika and her abilities, Salvato explained that he was inspired by \"things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face.\"<ref name=interview>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club''{{'}}s Horror Was Born From A Love-Hate Relationship With Anime |last=Jackson |first=Gita |date=October 20, 2017 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=October 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021235436/https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> To achieve this, Salvato developed the fa\u00e7ade of a cute setting, which would break down over time along with the behavior of the characters, and eventually the role of one [[evil]] character (Monika) who had seized control of the game from the player would be revealed. In creating the game's horror elements, Salvato drew inspiration from ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' and ''[[Eversion (video game)|Eversion]]'', emphasizing to his team that he wanted the market for visual novels to become much more daring and less reliant on the same plot concepts.<ref name=\"Concept3\">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

Outraged, this led to her using her powers of manipulating the script to do things like emphasizing the negative traits of the other characters Sayori and Yuri (respectively [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[self-harm]]), in the hope that the player would choose her instead of them, only for the player to turn to the \"worthless\" Natsuki for platonic companionship.\n\nAfter the protagonist \"MC\" notices that Sayori (his [[childhood sweetheart]] seems \"down\" about something, he informs Monika about it, who expresses interest in having \"a talk with Sayori\". Jealous of the friendship that Sayori and the protagonist have, Monika instead manipulates Sayori's code to have her commit [[suicide]] by [[hanging]], breaking the script and deleting Sayori from the game, which makes the entire game restart with Sayori being completely absent. Due to Monika's manipulation of the script, from this point onward there are a variety of \"glitches\" in the game, and she manipulates the personality of Yuri, one of the other two main characters, to be more intensive. She often uses the script to make other characters try and get the main protagonist to spend more with Monika; A famous example of this is when she removes Natsuki's face and forces her to repeatedly say \"Just Monika\".\n\nEventually, Yuri's obsessive personality becomes so intense that she kills herself over the protagonist, leaving them trapped in the characters' [[school]] for the length of a [[weekend]], leading Natsuki to [[vomit]] and Monika to completely delete both remaining character's files, restarting the game with just her. When she is alone with the protagonist, she reveals she is not in love with him, but with the player themselves, drawing them into the game in the character's place. She continues to endlessly talk with the player about various topics as [[love]], [[vegetarianism]] and her [[Twitter]] account, unless the player completely deletes her from the game by going into the game files. When this is done, she will initially express fury at the player, but then shows regret for her actions towards her former friends and devolution into a [[villain]]. In an attempt to repent for her wrongdoings, she brings back the other three girls and seemingly fully removes herself from the game.\n\nIf the player attempts to reload or copy her file back in, she sends them a message asking them not to toy with her heart and she no longer wants to come back after her previous actions. However, when the player restarts the game with the other three girls, Sayori gains self-awareness and data manipulation powers like Monika's, having taken her place as the president of the Literature Club. After thanking the player for ridding the game of Monika, she alternatively (depending on the player's actions) also attempts to trap the player in the same classroom Monika did, in the hopes that she will be in a relationship with them forever, or learns from Monika's mistakes and allowed them to leave. In the first ending, Monika, realising that no one is ever going to find happiness in the game, deletes it entirely, possibly taking her existence and that of her friends with it. In both endings however, before the credits roll, she communicates vocally with the player for the first time and plays and sings \"Your Reality\" while playing notes from a [[piano]] as she deletes each file in the game, and eventually the script itself. In the first ending, she will additionally leave a goodbye note, serving to explain her final actions.\n\n===Other media===\nMonika appears in the promotional [[Twitter]] page [https://twitter.com/lilmonix3 @lilmonix3], set during and after the events of ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'', in which she finally enjoys life outside of the confines of the game after escaping to the [[internet]]: wearing clothes other than her [[school uniform]], eating [[chocolate]], having a \"[[sleepover]]\" with Yuri, celebrating [[Valentine's Day]], and dressing as a [[fallen angel]] for [[Halloween]].\n\n==Development history==\n[[File:DDLC_Character_Sketches.png|thumb|right|The prototypical versions of Monika (second figure on the right) was created by Dan Salvato in a free online program for creating anime characters.]]\n\nBecause Salvato lacked artistic skill, he used a free online anime-creation program to create the initial character design of Monika and other characters, and applied these designs in test versions of the game.<ref name=\"Concept5\">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English  Crown he suffered  considerable hardship  during the [[English Civil War]], and died in poverty.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], probably at [[Merrion Castle]], eldest of the five  sons  of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of [[Wicklow]], and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th [[Viscount Gormanston]].<ref>Ball, F.

As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home.

No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, In  1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes.

When Patch kills drunken Luke Mills in self-defense, the town decides it is time for the marshal to resign.  But Patch refuses, reminding the citizens that when he took the job, the agreement was he could have it as long as he wanted. Afraid of Patch because of his knowledge of their misdeeds in the town's wilder days, the city fathers then decide the only way to remove Patch from office is by violence.\n\nPatch humiliates one of town's councilmen, a cowardly shopkeeper, by slapping him. The man plans to kill Patch, but when Patch faces him down, he turns the gun on himself. The man's son swears revenge, supported by local leaders. They plot to ambush Patch. Aware that he will probably be killed, Patch marries his long-time girlfriend, the local brothel madame. The marriage is on the same day as the shopkeeper's funeral, after which Patch's death is planned. The dead man's son attempts to kill Patch on his own, but is shot by Patch. Patch explains to the dying youth that his father had murdered a man many years ago. Patch covered it up because he had agreed to raise the dead man's child. Patch pursues one of the instigators of the plot to kill him. He wounds and captures him, but then insists on going back out, knowing he will be gunned down.

During this upgrade, State Highway 1 from the end of the Southern Motorway to just north of Mercer was upgraded from two lanes to four, with grade separated interchanges constructed at Bombay and the junction with State Highway 2 just north of the township of [[Pokeno]].

During this upgrade, State Highway 1 from the end of the Southern Motorway to just north of Mercer was upgraded from two lanes to four, with grade separated interchanges constructed at Bombay and the junction with State Highway 2 just north of the township of [[Pokeno]].
