Born in [[Koyukuk, Alaska]], Notti arguably played the most pivotal role in developing the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska and could, perhaps, be considered an ending of more than a century of endeavor by the Native people of the state to secure their land, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska. Notti was the first President of the Alaska Federation of Natives and Doyon\u2019s third President, a regional corporation who owns 12.5 million acres. <ref>https://www.doyon.com/shareholder-spotlight-emil-notti/</ref> He is a U.S. Navy veteran and worked for Autonetics, a division of North American Aviation, on the Minuteman Ballistic Missile. Later, he served under several Alaska governors as deputy commissioner of Health and Social Services, commissioner of Community and Regional Affairs and commissioner of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. Notti served on numerous boards, including the National Bank of Alaska (acquired by Wells Fargo), the Alaska Railroad, a two time Board of Trustee for APFC (the United State's largest Sovereign Wealth Fund with $75 billion under management), and Cook Inlet Regional, Inc. Furthermore, Notti worked under three Governors of Alaska: William Egan, the first governor of the State of Alaska, Bill Sheffield, and Sarah Palin, the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 2008 presidential election alongside Senator John McCain. Notti earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautical and electrical engineering from Northrop University, and holds honorary doctorate degrees from both Alaska Pacific University and the University of Alaska Anchorage.\n\n==AFN and ANCSA==\nOn an October morning in 1966, Emil called for a Statewide meeting inviting numerous leaders around Alaska to gather and create the first meeting of a committee. The historic meeting was held October 18, 1966 - on the 99th anniversary of the transfer of Alaska from Russia. Notti presided over the three-day conference as it discussed matters of land recommendations, claims committees, and political challenges the act would have getting through Congress. Many respected politicians and businessmen attended the meeting and delegates were astonished at the attention which they received from well-known political figures of the state. One Native leader in attendance at the convention observed that \"if any delegate was seen paying for his own meal, it was probably because he chose to dine alone!\" The growing presence and political importance of Natives were evidenced when association leaders were elected to the legislature. Members of the association gathered and were able to gain seven of the sixty seats in the legislature. When the group met a second time early in 1967, it emerged with a new name, The Alaska Federation of Natives, and a new full-time President, Emil Notti. AFN would change the human rights and economic stability of the Alaska Native population forever.\n\nBefore ANCSA, the Native population had gone through numerous hardships over the last century from European expansion. In the mid-1700s Alaska's population (according to [[James Mooney]]) was home to an estimated 74,000 Eskimos, Indians, and Aleuts. As of 2018, the Native population in Alaska is around 110,972 showing the cruelties and killings of thousands over generations by the Russian fur traders during the [[Russian-American Company]] period. From 1750 to 2018 the annual growth rate of the local Alaska Native population has been 0.15%. In comparison, since 1790 the United States population as a whole has grown at a 1.96% annual growth rate. Alaska's closest comparable state by population is North Dakota at a 2017 estimate of 757,000 residents. The population of North Dakota has grown 3.96% since the earliest data of North Dakota demographics. Alaskan Natives' low growth rate is just barely lower than Poland's 1931-2018 rate of 0.20% which suffered over six million deaths in [[World War II]].\n\nAfter the [[Alaska Purchase|purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867]], Alaska was still not classified a State and was considered a territory. Native Alaskans still did not have the rights of U.S. citizens. \"Thus, without further ceremony,\" wrote historian Bancroft, \"this vast area of land, belonging by right to neither, was transferred from one European race to the offshoot of another.\" Negotiations regarding the purchase of the land were conducted with such speed that the treaty itself was hastily drawn and failed to define clearly the status of Natives, their rights, or matters of land ownership. Only one paragraph (part of Article III) was devoted to the inhabitants of Russia-America. It was not until 1959 that Alaska would officially become a State of the United States. \n\nAt hearings held in Fairbanks and Anchorage the 17th and 18th of October 1969 prior to the passage of ANCSA, Notti commented pushing that the money in the bill was not enough \"The $500 million provision of our bill may seem like a lot of money, but after looking at the conditions in our villages, $500 million will only give our Native people a chance to operate on a standard of living of what we consider basic minimums, I think, for the rest of the United States.\" <ref>http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/testimony/ancsa_hearings/e_notti_s.html</ref>In its final bill, ANCSA would give the Native people of Alaska over $900 million. After many congressional meetings, he had no organization, no political experience, no funding; there was no precedent for what had to be done. He accomplished the task of the land claims in five years. ANCSA, the act, composed of 44 million acres (180,000 km2) and $962.5 million patented and titles transferred to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. The surface rights to the patented land were granted to the village corporations and the subsurface right to the land was granted to the regional corporation, creating a split estate pursuant to section 14(f). Notti also cast the tie-breaking vote to enter Sealaska and Tlingit and Haida into the Alaska Federation of Natives. His tie-breaker vote brought $7.2 million and 290,000 acres of land to Native Corporations in Southeast Alaska.<ref>https://www.kinyradio.com/news/news-of-the-north/sealaska-speech/</ref> In 2017, 9 out of the 10 largest Alaska-owned and -operated corporations by revenue were Native corporations, given life by the creation of ANCSA. The twelve regional Native corporations and several village corporations today employ around 58,000 people creating thousands of jobs for Native and non-Native Alaskans.  \n\nIn his foreword to the book ''Alaska Native Land Claims'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Alaska-native-claims-Robert-Arnold/dp/B0006CVEIE|title=Alaska native land claims|date=1976|author=Robert D Arnold|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> published with support from the Ford Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=ford+foundation&oq=ford+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l2j69i57j69i60l2.1417j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8|title=ford foundation - Google Search|website=Google.com|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Notti delivers a powerfully compelling narrative about the passage of ANCSA and its implications as an awakening to the Canadian and Hawaiian Native people. An excerpt from the Foreword:\n\n<blockquote>No Alaskan--Native or non-Native--is unaffected by the settlement. To some it has meant money and title to lands and the growing assurance that comes from waging a successful fight and becoming a little more a master of one's own fate; to others it means they are no longer so free to move across the face of Alaska as millions of acres become private property. Nov. 1975</blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the passage of ANCSA, Notti continued his career with AFN, eventually becoming the CEO of Doyon Limited, Commissioner of Commerce & Economic Development, and Commissioner of Community & Regional Affairs for the State of Alaska. \n\nToday, Notti is considered one of the most highly respected leaders of the Native Alaskan people and many State and local public officials during elections seek his endorsement to gain the Native population vote. He also continues to advise and voice his opinion on the current state of affairs regarding the Native Alaskan people for their best interest.\n\n==References==\n<ref>Resource Development Council for Alaska</ref>\n<ref>http://www.litsitealaska.org/index.cfm?section=History-and-Culture&page=ANCSA-at-30&cat=Interviews&viewpost=2&ContentId=757</ref>\n<ref>''Alaska Native Land Claims'' by Robert D.

Being developed during Schreiber's tenure in a record store at the time, the magazine developed a reputation for its extensive focus on [[independent music]], but has since expanded to a variety of coverage on both indie and [[popular music]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Dan|date=November 13, 2014|url=http://ajr.org/2014/11/13/music-critics-role-changing/|title=Are Professional Music Critics an Endangered Species?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe site generally concentrates on new music, but ''Pitchfork'' journalists have also reviewed [[reissue]]s and [[box set]]s. Since 2016, it has published retrospective reviews of classic or otherwise important albums every Sunday. The site has also published \"best-of\" lists\u2014such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the best songs of the 1960s\u2014as well as annual features detailing the best albums and tracks of each year since 1999 (and a retrospective Best Albums of 1998 list in 2018).\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 230\n| image2 = Pitchfork Media Logo.svg\n| caption2 = Previous ''Pitchfork'' logo\n| total_width = \n| image1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\n{{see also|The Dissolve}}\nIn late 1995, Ryan Schreiber, a recent high school graduate, created the magazine in [[Minneapolis]]. Influenced by local [[fanzine]]s and [[KUOM]], Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for [[Indie (music)|independent music]]. Initially called ''Turntable'', the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed ''Pitchfork'', alluding to [[Tony Montana]]'s tattoo in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html |title= Giving Indie Acts A Plug, or Pulling It |last= Freedom du Lac |first= J. |date= April 30, 2006 |website= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1999, Schreiber relocated ''Pitchfork'' to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of [[underground music]] and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of [[journalism]]. In October, the site added a daily music news section.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Pitchfork'' has launched a variety of subsidiary websites.

As suggested in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article in April 2006, ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an [[independent record label]]. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman [[Travis Morrison]]'s ''[[Travistan]]'' album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist.<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/> On the other hand, \"an endorsement from Pitchfork\u2014which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points\u2014is very valuable, indeed.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/>\n\nExamples of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s impact include:\n*[[Arcade Fire]] is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a ''Pitchfork'' review.

It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 \u2013 Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between ''Pitchfork'' and the British music festival [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] as part of the latter's \"Don't Look Back\" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included [[Sonic Youth]] playing ''[[Daydream Nation]]'', [[Slint]] playing ''[[Spiderland]]'', and [[GZA (musician)|GZA/Genius]] playing ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included [[Yoko Ono]], [[De La Soul]], [[Cat Power]], [[The New Pornographers]], [[Stephen Malkmus]], [[Clipse]], [[Iron & Wine]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[of Montreal]], [[Deerhunter]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Ponys]], and [[The Sea and Cake]]. Since 2011, a European winter edition of the festival takes place in Paris.\n\n===All Tomorrow's Parties===\nIn 2008 ''Pitchfork'' collaborated with [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This was the first event that ''Pitchfork'' has been involved in outside of the United States.\n\n==Rating system==\n''Pitchfork''{{'}}s music reviews use two different rating systems:\n* Individual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called \"Forkcast\". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the following categories: \"New Music\", \"Old Music\", \"Video\", \"Advanced Music\", \"Rising\", \"[[What the fuck?#Modern usage|WTF]]\", \"On Repeat\" (the category of their most favorably regarded songs), and \"Delete\" (for the least favored songs). {{As of|2009}}, the site had officially removed this system, opting to instead simply review tracks, while giving some a label of \"Best New Track\".\n* Album reviews are given a rating from 0 to 10, specific to one decimal point.\n\nOn October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchformula.com|title=Pitchformula.com|website=pitchformula.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on ''Pitchfork'' at that time, showing that:\n* 6.7 was the average rating\n* 2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher\n* 2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3\n* 873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0<ref name=\"Pitchformula\"/>\n\nBritish Sea Power's 2008 album ''[[Do You Like Rock Music?]]'' was initially awarded a tongue-in-cheek rating of \"U.2\", however the page now gives a rating of 8.2, seemingly at odds with the critical review.<ref>{{Cite web|title = British Sea Power: Do You Like Rock Music?|url = https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = February 5, 2016|language = en-US}}</ref> Their rating of [[Run the Jewels]]' remix album ''Meow the Jewels'' (2015) was a pictogram of a cat's head with hearts for eyes \u2013 highlighting the pictogram and right-clicking on it reveals that the actual score is 7.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Their review of [[Pope Francis]]' album ''[[Wake Up!

The score is rare and has only been given to twelve albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10 on re-release. Note that Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, effectively reducing the canon of albums that Pitchfork still considers to be worthy of a 10.0 on initial release to seven albums.\n\n''[[Relaxation of the Asshole]]'', a comedy album by [[Guided by Voices]] singer [[Robert Pollard]], was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/ Robert Pollard - ''Relaxation of the Asshole'' review] \u2013 Pitchfork</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.5em;\"\n|-\n!

Being developed during Schreiber's tenure in a record store at the time, the magazine developed a reputation for its extensive focus on [[independent music]], but has since expanded to a variety of coverage on both indie and [[popular music]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Dan|date=November 13, 2014|url=http://ajr.org/2014/11/13/music-critics-role-changing/|title=Are Professional Music Critics an Endangered Species?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe site generally concentrates on new music, but ''Pitchfork'' journalists have also reviewed [[reissue]]s and [[box set]]s. Since 2016, it has published retrospective reviews of classic or otherwise important albums every Sunday. The site has also published \"best-of\" lists\u2014such as the best albums of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and the best songs of the 1960s\u2014as well as annual features detailing the best albums and tracks of each year since 1999 (and a retrospective Best Albums of 1998 list in 2018).\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 230\n| image2 = Pitchfork Media Logo.svg\n| caption2 = Previous ''Pitchfork'' logo\n| total_width = \n| image1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\n{{see also|The Dissolve}}\nIn late 1995, Ryan Schreiber, a recent high school graduate, created the magazine in [[Minneapolis]]. Influenced by local [[fanzine]]s and [[KUOM]], Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for [[Indie (music)|independent music]]. Initially called ''Turntable'', the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed ''Pitchfork'', alluding to [[Tony Montana]]'s tattoo in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html |title= Giving Indie Acts A Plug, or Pulling It |last= Freedom du Lac |first= J. |date= April 30, 2006 |website= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1999, Schreiber relocated ''Pitchfork'' to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of [[underground music]] and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of [[journalism]]. In October, the site added a daily music news section.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Pitchfork'' has launched a variety of subsidiary websites.

Team]], [[Junior Boys]], [[The Books]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Cold War Kids]], [[Wolf Parade]], [[Tapes 'n Tapes]], and [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]] although the site's true impact on their popularity remains a source of frequent debate.\n\nConversely, ''Pitchfork'' has also been seen as being a negative influence on some indie artists. As suggested in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article in April 2006, ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an [[independent record label]]. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman [[Travis Morrison]]'s ''[[Travistan]]'' album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist.<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/> On the other hand, \"an endorsement from Pitchfork\u2014which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points\u2014is very valuable, indeed.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post\"/>\n\nExamples of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s impact include:\n*[[Arcade Fire]] is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a ''Pitchfork'' review.

A 2006 article in ''[[City Pages]]'' noted the large discretion the site gave to its writers, arguing it was \"under-edited\" and that the prose was often \"overly florid\".<ref name=\"City Pages\"/> Shaer singled out some examples of \"verbose and unreadable writing\".<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154469|title=The indie music site that everyone loves to hate.|author=Matthew Shaer|date=November 28, 2006|work=Slate Magazine}}</ref> In response, Schreiber told ''City Pages'' that \"I trust the writers to their opinions and to their own style and presentation.

It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 \u2013 Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between ''Pitchfork'' and the British music festival [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] as part of the latter's \"Don't Look Back\" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included [[Sonic Youth]] playing ''[[Daydream Nation]]'', [[Slint]] playing ''[[Spiderland]]'', and [[GZA (musician)|GZA/Genius]] playing ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included [[Yoko Ono]], [[De La Soul]], [[Cat Power]], [[The New Pornographers]], [[Stephen Malkmus]], [[Clipse]], [[Iron & Wine]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[of Montreal]], [[Deerhunter]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Ponys]], and [[The Sea and Cake]]. Since 2011, a European winter edition of the festival takes place in Paris.\n\n===All Tomorrow's Parties===\nIn 2008 ''Pitchfork'' collaborated with [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This was the first event that ''Pitchfork'' has been involved in outside of the United States.\n\n==Rating system==\n''Pitchfork''{{'}}s music reviews use two different rating systems:\n* Individual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called \"Forkcast\". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the following categories: \"New Music\", \"Old Music\", \"Video\", \"Advanced Music\", \"Rising\", \"[[What the fuck?#Modern usage|WTF]]\", \"On Repeat\" (the category of their most favorably regarded songs), and \"Delete\" (for the least favored songs). {{As of|2009}}, the site had officially removed this system, opting to instead simply review tracks, while giving some a label of \"Best New Track\".\n* Album reviews are given a rating from 0 to 10, specific to one decimal point.\n\nOn October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchformula.com|title=Pitchformula.com|website=pitchformula.com|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}</ref> made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on ''Pitchfork'' at that time, showing that:\n* 6.7 was the average rating\n* 2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher\n* 2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3\n* 873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0<ref name=\"Pitchformula\"/>\n\nBritish Sea Power's 2008 album ''[[Do You Like Rock Music?]]'' was initially awarded a tongue-in-cheek rating of \"U.2\", however the page now gives a rating of 8.2, seemingly at odds with the critical review.<ref>{{Cite web|title = British Sea Power: Do You Like Rock Music?|url = https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = February 5, 2016|language = en-US}}</ref> Their rating of [[Run the Jewels]]' remix album ''Meow the Jewels'' (2015) was a pictogram of a cat's head with hearts for eyes \u2013 highlighting the pictogram and right-clicking on it reveals that the actual score is 7.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Their review of [[Pope Francis]]' album ''[[Wake Up!

The score is rare and has only been given to twelve albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10 on re-release. Note that Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, effectively reducing the canon of albums that Pitchfork still considers to be worthy of a 10.0 on initial release to seven albums.\n\n''[[Relaxation of the Asshole]]'', a comedy album by [[Guided by Voices]] singer [[Robert Pollard]], was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/ Robert Pollard - ''Relaxation of the Asshole'' review] \u2013 Pitchfork</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.5em;\"\n|-\n!

He was always in very deep thought and a bit uptight too, like he was getting ready to explode, but always a very nice guy.\"<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>In the late 1970s, the Saloon, the oldest running saloon in San Francisco,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfblues.net/Saloon.html|title=San Francisco Blues on SFBlues.net: The Saloon|website=www.sfblues.net|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> became a local hub for blues.<ref name=\":9\" /> The owner at the time, Tommy Browne, decided to offer live music shows on weekends. [[Lisa Kindred]], who had previously played music in the [[American folk music revival|Greenwich Village folk]]  and Chicago blues scenes, was a bartender at the Saloon at the time. She began to play blues at the bar with Gino Skaggs.

Ron Thompson also played the guitar On some nights, musicians such as [[Nick Gravenites]], [[John Cipollina]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], and [[Roy Rogers (guitarist)|Roy Rogers]] played with the band.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son Prince Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== The seat of learning ===\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== The grandeur of Jain temples ===\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, the minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples|Dilwara]] [[Jain temples]]. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11<sup>th</sup> century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara.

After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao?

He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhanatha]] (Rishabhdevbhagwan) and one of [[Parshvanatha]] (Parshvnathbhagwan). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]]. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujarat visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11<sup>th</sup> century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015). Udaipur Rajya ka Itihas Part 1 & 2 (Hindi). Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cThe information regarding genealogy of Deora Chauhans, available from the different books of \u2018Bhaats\u2019 (story tellers) and inscriptions, is full of contradictions and the names are at variance. There is a difference of opinion as well, among historians regarding genealogy of Songara and Deora Chauhans\u201d.'' </blockquote>\n\n==Rulers of Delwara before medieval period==\nBhanwarlal Nahata writes in \u2018Bachhawat MunthaVanshavli\u2019,<ref>BhanwarlalNahata (2009).

Sagar\u2019s son Bohitya became sharvak (Jain disciple) by the blessings of Vardhman Suri Khartar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nRaja Sagar fought against Muslim invaders<br>\nDuring 12<sup>th</sup> century, Rao Samant Singh of Jalore had four sons \u2013 Rao Kanhadeo, Maldeo, Raningdeo and Sagar. Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Muhammad Bin Tughluk brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near Mandalgarh. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao?
