Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}</ref> A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Usually a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]]. \n\nIf a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).\n\nA monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nMonarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles \u2013 [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]), [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]), or a [[pharaoh]]. King is mostly used as a general term for monarchs regardless of title.\n\nA king can also be a queen's husband, and is the general title for a male monarch. If both of the couple reigns, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.\n\nSome monarchies are non-hereditary. \n\nIn an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. \n\nModern examples include the Major Archbishop-Catholicos, of the Sacred Catholic Church of the East of the Chaldeans, who serves as the Sovereign of the Ecclesiastical State, which is appointed by the previous sovereign or by a government council, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].\n\nIn recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase \"[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]\". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies), real leadership does not depend on the monarch.\n\nA form of government may, in fact, be hereditary without being considered a monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].\n\n==Classification==\nMonarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:European monarchies by succession.svg|upright=0.85|left|thumb|Contemporary European monarchies by type of succession {{legend|#018571|[[Absolute primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#dfc27d|[[Male-preference cognatic primogeniture]]}}{{legend|#000000|[[Agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#f5f5f5|[[Elective monarchy|Elective/appointed]]}}]]\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Nine Sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.\n\nThe system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.\n\nAs the average life span increased, the eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favored over proximity, tanistry, seniority, and election.\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd'', p. 16.</ref> Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544|title=Overturning centuries of royal rules|date=28 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/29500-new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy|title=New Ducal succession rights for Grand Duchy|website=luxtimes.lu}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nIn some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.\n\nWhatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.\n\n==History==\n\n===Monarchs in Africa===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}\n[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]\nA series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC) until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short-lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922 when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.\n\n[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700\u20131376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].\n[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] Warsangali Sultanate]]\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270\u20131974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].\n\n[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400\u20131914).\n\nThe [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.\n\nAs part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCurrently, the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called \"sub-national monarchies\" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.\n\n===Monarchs in Europe===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Europe}}\n[[File:European monarchies.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A map of Europe exhibiting the continent's monarchies (red) and republics (blue)]]\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Elizabeth II]] has been monarch of independent countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas.]]\n\nWithin the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City, and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.\n\n{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).\n\n===Monarchs in Asia===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Asia}}\n[[File:Crown Prince & Princess & Emperor Showa & Empress Kojun wedding 1959-4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|From left to right, Japanese [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]], [[Akihito|Crown Prince Akihito]], [[Empress Michiko|Crown Princess Michiko]] and [[Empress K\u014djun|Empress Nagako]], 1959]]\nIn China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of \"[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]\". \"King\" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' \u738b, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.\nIn Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title \"[[Taewang]]\", meaning the \"Great king\". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of \"Geoseogan\", \"Chachaung\", \"Isageum\", and finally \"Maripgan\" until 503. The title \"Gun\" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of the Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897\u20131910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of \"Hwangje\", meaning the \"Emperor\". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's imperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].\n\nIn modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of \"Shahanshah\" (or \"King of Kings\"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as \"The Great Kourosh\" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[Empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.\n\n[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].\n\n[[File:Sultan Mehmet III of the Ottoman Empire.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Sultan [[Mehmed III]] from [[Ottoman Dynasty]]]]\n[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and Arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is the absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).\n\nUnder [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.\n\n[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.\n[[File:The Sinhalese Royal Family of King Devanampiya Tissa and Prince Uththiya.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Sri Lankan [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|King Devanampiya Tissa]], Queen consort Anula, and [[Uttiya of Anuradhapura|Prince Uththiya]], c. 307 BC]]\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''har\u00ec'' (today meaning \"king\"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principal\u00eda]]''. After the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.\n\n[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became an absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.\n\n[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.\n\n===Monarchs in the Americas===\n{{Further|Monarchies in the Americas}}\n[[File:Jean Jacques Dessalines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Jacques I of Haiti|Jacques I]], [[Emperor of Haiti]], 1804]]\n\n[[File:Delfim da C\u00e2mara - D.

A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]].

A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).\n\nThe table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]].

One of the titles of the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] was ''Kaysar-i-R\u00fbm'' (Emperor of Rome), Kaysar being a rough transliteration of ''Caesar'' (Emperor) into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. ''Kaisar-i-Hind'', derived from the German word ''Kaiser'', was the [[Urdu]] translation of \"Emperor of India\".\n|-\n|[[King]]\n|[[Queen regnant|Queen]]\n|[[Monarchy|Kingdom]]\n|Common in larger sovereign states.

An official who runs a [[country]], [[colony]], [[city]], [[province]], or sub-national state, in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory.\nHistorical: [[Spain|Spanish]] Empire ([[Viceroy of Peru]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]), [[Portuguese Empire]] ([[Portuguese India|Viceroy of India]], [[Kingdom of Brazil|Viceroy of Brazil]]), [[British Empire]] ([[Viceroy of India]]), [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] ([[Caucasus Viceroyalty (disambiguation)|Viceroyalty of the Caucasus]]). The title ''Vicer\u00e9'' was used in the [[Italian Colonial Empire]]. An equivalent office called the \"[[Exarch]]\" was used in the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Archduke]]\n|[[Archduchess]]\n|[[Archduchy]]\n|Historical: Unique to the [[House of Habsburg]] which ruled the [[Archduchy]] of [[Austria]]; title used for all members of dynasty\n|-\n|[[Grand Duke]]\n|[[Grand Duchess]]\n|[[Grand Duchy]]\n|Today: [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]].

Self-proclaimed [[micronation]]s claiming to be principalities include the [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], [[Principality of Seborga|Seborga]] and [[Principality of Hutt River|Hutt River]].\n|-\n|[[Marquis]]\n|Marquise\n|Marquisate/[[March (territorial entity)|March]]\n|A continental rank below that of a Duke but above a Count. British version is [[Marquess]]. Although [[Margrave]] shares word-origin, in Germany it referred to rulers (of [[Margraviate]]s) rather than nobles. Historical examples: [[Marquess of Queensbury]], [[Marquisate of Saluzzo]], [[Marquisate of Mantua]].\n|-\n|[[Count]]/[[Earl]]\n|[[Countess]]\n|[[County]]/Earldom/Shire\n|Count is most common term for a continental, middle-ranked noble. British equivalent is [[Earl]] (whose female counterpart or wife is \"Countess\"). There are no remaining independent counties and the word county is used to denote an administrative district. Historical examples include [[County of Toulouse]], [[County of Castile]], [[County of Barcelona]] and [[Earldom of Orkney]].\nEtymological equivalent male/female/territory titles include Comte/Comtesse/Comt\u00e9 in French, Conte/Contessa/Contea in Italian, Conde/Condesa/Condado in Spanish, Conde/Condessa/Condado in Portuguese, [[Graf]]/Gr\u00e4fin/Grafschaft in German, Graaf/Gravin/Graafschap in Dutch, Greve/Grevinna/Grevskap in Swedish.\n|-\n|[[Viscount]]\n|[[Viscountess]]\n|Viscountcy\n|Literally a vice or deputy count, from ''visconte'' in [[Old French]].

The German ''Burggraf'' and Dutch ''Burggraaf'' are historical equivalents although they are not translated as \"Viscount\"; a rank above Baron but below Count. There are no remaining viscountcies but Viscount remains a title in Belgium, France, Spain and the UK. Historical examples: [[Viscountcy of B\u00e9arn]], [[Burgraviate of Nuremberg]] (''Burggrafschaft N\u00fcrnberg'').\n|-\n|[[Lord]]\n|[[Lady]]\n|[[Lordship]]\n|Today: [[Isle of Man]]; historical: [[Lordship of Ireland]], [[Lord of the Isles]]\n|-\n|[[Baron]]\n|[[Baroness]]\n|[[Feudal barony|Barony]]\n|The equivalent title is still legally borne in Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Surviving examples include [[Barony of Kendal|Kendal]] and [[Barony of Westmorland|Westmorland]] in England, the [[Lordship and Barony of Hailes]] in Scotland and [[Barony Rosendal]] in Norway.\nEquivalent titles include ''Barone'' in Italian, ''Bar\u00f3n'' in Spanish, ''Bar\u00e3o'' in Portuguese, ''[[Boyar]]'' in [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Wallachia]]n, and [[Moldavia]]n, ''[[Freiherr]]'' in German (sometimes used concurrently with ''Baron''), ''Friherre'' is the title in the [[Swedish nobility|nobility of Sweden]] while the spoken address is Baron, ''Vapaaherra'' in the [[nobility of Finland]].\n|}\n\n==Titles outside modern Europe==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Male]] version\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Female]] version\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Realm]]\n!Notes and examples\n|-\n|[[Caliph]]\n|\n|[[Caliphate]] \n|Used throughout the [[Muslim world]].

Equivalent to King. The use of \"sultan\" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular \"malik\", which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. Current examples: [[Brunei]], [[Oman]], [[Monarchies of Malaysia|states of Malaysia]]. Historical examples: [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Sultanate]], [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Sultanate of Malacca]], Warsangali Sultanate.\n|-\n|[[Malik]]\n|Malikah/Malekeh\n|Mamlaka\n|Used throughout the [[Muslim world]].

A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957. Current examples: [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]]. Also used by tribal leaders among the [[Pashtun people]]. Historical examples: ''[[List of Kings of Iraq|Malik al-'Iraq]]'' (\"King of Iraq\"), ''[[List of Kings of Yemen|Malik al-Mamlaka al-Mutawakkiliyya al-Yamaniyya]]'' (\"King of the Mutawakkilite Yemeni Kingdom\").\n|-\n|[[Khedive]]\n|\n|Khedivate \n|Largely equivalent to [[Viceroy]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

There are at least five cases of this:\n* [[Pretender|Claiming an existing title]], challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].\n* Retaining the title of an [[extinct monarchy]]. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies, e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the \"King of The Albanians\". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include \"[[King of Jerusalem]]\" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.\n* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised abroad]]. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the \"Prince of Sealand\", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title \"Emperor of the United States of America\" and later declared himself \"Protector of Mexico\".\n* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].\n* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as \"King of Rock and Roll\", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | first = Philippe R. | last = Girard | year = 2011 | title = The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence 1801\u20131804 | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | publisher = The University of Alabama Press | isbn = 978-0-8173-1732-4 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Schutt-Ain\u00e9\n| first = Patricia\n| authorlink =\n| title = Haiti: A Basic Reference Book\n| publisher = Librairie Au Service de la Culture\n| year = 1994\n| location = Miami, Florida\n| pages = 33\u201335, 60\n| isbn = 978-0-9638599-0-7 }}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.haitiwebs.com/emagazine/content/view/318/155/1/0/lang,en/ |last=TiCam |title=17 October: Death of Dessalines |publisher=haitiwebs.com |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928222734/http://www.haitiwebs.com/emagazine/content/view/318/155/1/0/lang%2Cen/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Politics|Royalty}}\n{{Wiktionary|monarch|kingship}}\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/odegard/titlefaq.htm A Glossary of European Noble, Princely, Royal and Imperial Titles]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114075322/http://starnarcosis.net/obsidian/regindex.html Regnal Chronologies] King lists worldwide\n*[http://www.archontology.org Archontology]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181225130229/http://imperialafrica.net/ African Kingdoms Imperial Throne Leadership and Enthronements]\n\n{{Monarchies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Monarchy|*]]\n[[Category:Monarchs|*]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Person at the head of a monarchy}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Monarchism |expanded=concepts}}\nA '''monarch''' is a sovereign [[head of state]] in a [[monarchy]].<ref>{{cite web | title=monarch | website=Oxford Dictionaries | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch | year=2014}}</ref><ref name=\"webster\">Webster's II New College Dictionary.[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch Monarch]. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}</ref> A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Usually a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]]. \n\nIf a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).\n\nA monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nMonarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles \u2013 [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]), [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]), or a [[pharaoh]]. King is mostly used as a general term for monarchs regardless of title.\n\nA king can also be a queen's husband, and is the general title for a male monarch. If both of the couple reigns, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.\n\nSome monarchies are non-hereditary. \n\nIn an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. \n\nModern examples include the the Major Archbishop-Catholicos, of the Sacred Catholic Church of the East of the Chaldeans, who serves as the Sovereign of the Ecclesiastical State, which is appointed by the previous sovereign or by a government council, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].\n\nIn recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase \"[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]\". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies), real leadership does not depend on the monarch.\n\nA form of government may, in fact, be hereditary without being considered a monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].\n\n==Classification==\nMonarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:European monarchies by succession.svg|upright=0.85|left|thumb|Contemporary European monarchies by type of succession {{legend|#018571|[[Absolute primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#dfc27d|[[Male-preference cognatic primogeniture]]}}{{legend|#000000|[[Agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#f5f5f5|[[Elective monarchy|Elective/appointed]]}}]]\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Nine Sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.\n\nThe system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.\n\nAs the average life span increased, the eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favored over proximity, tanistry, seniority, and election.\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref>SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd'', p. 16.</ref> Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544|title=Overturning centuries of royal rules|date=28 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/29500-new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy|title=New Ducal succession rights for Grand Duchy|website=luxtimes.lu}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nIn some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.\n\nWhatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.\n\n==History==\n\n===Monarchs in Africa===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}\n[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]\nA series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC) until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short-lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922 when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.\n\n[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700\u20131376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].\n[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] Warsangali Sultanate]]\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270\u20131974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].\n\n[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400\u20131914).\n\nThe [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.\n\nAs part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCurrently, the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called \"sub-national monarchies\" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.\n\n===Monarchs in Europe===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Europe}}\n[[File:European monarchies.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A map of Europe exhibiting the continent's monarchies (red) and republics (blue)]]\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Elizabeth II]] has been monarch of independent countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas.]]\n\nWithin the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City, and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.\n\n{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).\n\n===Monarchs in Asia===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Asia}}\n[[File:Crown Prince & Princess & Emperor Showa & Empress Kojun wedding 1959-4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|From left to right, Japanese [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]], [[Akihito|Crown Prince Akihito]], [[Empress Michiko|Crown Princess Michiko]] and [[Empress K\u014djun|Empress Nagako]], 1959]]\nIn China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of \"[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]\". \"King\" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' \u738b, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.\nIn Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title \"[[Taewang]]\", meaning the \"Great king\". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of \"Geoseogan\", \"Chachaung\", \"Isageum\", and finally \"Maripgan\" until 503. The title \"Gun\" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of the Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897\u20131910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of \"Hwangje\", meaning the \"Emperor\". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's imperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].\n\nIn modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of \"Shahanshah\" (or \"King of Kings\"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as \"The Great Kourosh\" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[Empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.\n\n[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.\n\n[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].\n\n[[File:Sultan Mehmet III of the Ottoman Empire.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Sultan [[Mehmed III]] from [[Ottoman Dynasty]]]]\n[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and Arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is the absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).\n\nUnder [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.\n\n[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.\n[[File:The Sinhalese Royal Family of King Devanampiya Tissa and Prince Uththiya.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Sri Lankan [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|King Devanampiya Tissa]], Queen consort Anula, and [[Uttiya of Anuradhapura|Prince Uththiya]], c. 307 BC]]\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900\u20131521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''har\u00ec'' (today meaning \"king\"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principal\u00eda]]''. After the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.\n\n[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became an absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.\n\n[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.\n\n===Monarchs in the Americas===\n{{Further|Monarchies in the Americas}}\n[[File:Jean Jacques Dessalines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Jacques I of Haiti|Jacques I]], [[Emperor of Haiti]], 1804]]\n\n[[File:Delfim da C\u00e2mara - D.

In South America, Brazil<ref>L Gomes. 1889: como um imperador cansado, um marechal vaidoso e um professor injusti\u00e7ado contribu\u00edram para a o fim da monarquia e programa\u00e7\u00e3o da republica no Brasil. Globo Livros. 2013.</ref> had a royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].\n\nBetween 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms. All, including Canada, are in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.\n\nIn addition to these sovereign states, there are also a number of sub-national ones. In [[Bolivia]], for example, the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] claims descent from an African dynasty that was taken from its homeland and sold into slavery. Though largely a ceremonial title today, the position of ''king of the Afro-Bolivians'' is officially recognized by the government of Bolivia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Male title\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Female title\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Realm]]\n!Examples\n|-\n|[[Emperor]]\n|Empress\n|[[Empire]]\n|[[Empire of Haiti (1804\u20131806)|Haiti (1804\u20131806)]] & [[Empire of Haiti (1849\u20131859)|(1849\u20131859)]], [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil (1822\u20131889)]], [[First Mexican Empire|Mexico (1821\u20131823)]] & [[Second Mexican Empire|(1864\u20131867)]], [[Sapa Inca]]\n|-\n|King\n|[[Queen regnant|Queen]]\n|[[Monarchy|Kingdom]]\n|[[Kingdom of Haiti|Haiti (1811\u20131820)]], [[Kingdom of Brazil|Brazil (1815-1822)]], [[Canada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\n|}\n\n===Monarchs in Oceania===\n{{Further|Monarchies in Oceania}}\n[[File:King Kamehameha IV painted by William Cogswell, Bishop Museum.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Kamehameha IV]], King of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]]]]\n[[Polynesia]]n societies were ruled by an ''[[ariki]]'' from ancient times. The title is variously translated as \"supreme chief\", \"paramount chief\" or \"king\".\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] was founded in 1788. Sovereignty was ceded to [[France]] in 1880 although descendants of the [[P\u014dmare Dynasty]] claim the title of King of Tahiti.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was established in 1795 and overthrown in 1893.\n\nAn independent [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858. It became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] at its own request in 1893.\n\n[[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] ruled the short-lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]], a constitutional monarchy, from 1871 to 1874 when he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to the [[United Kingdom]]. After independence in 1970, the [[Dominion of Fiji]] retained the British monarch as head of state until it became a republic following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|military coup in 1987]].\n\n[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] (including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]] are sovereign states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that currently have [[Elizabeth II]] as their reigning constitutional monarch.\n\nThe [[Pitcairn Islands]] are part of the [[British Overseas Territories]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as the reigning constitutional monarch.\n\n[[Tonga]] is the only remaining sovereign kingdom in Oceania. It has had a monarch since the 10th century and became a constitutional monarchy in 1875. In 2008, King [[George Tupou V]] relinquished most of the powers of the monarchy and the position is now largely ceremonial.\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] the position of [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]] was established in 1858. The role is largely cultural and ceremonial and has no legal power.\n\n[[Wallis Island|Uvea]], [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]] and [[Sigave]] in the [[France|French]] territory of [[Wallis and Futuna]] have non-sovereign elective monarchs.\n\n==Titles and precedence in Europe==\n{{unsourced-section|date=July 2019}}\n{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}}\n\nThe usage and meaning of a monarch's specific title have historically been defined by tradition, law and diplomatic considerations.\n\nNote that some titles borne by monarchs have several meanings and may not exclusively designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a [[prince du sang|person of royal blood]] (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[F\u00fcrst]]). A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]]. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as monarchs of the same title.\n\nWithin the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were numerous titles used by noblemen whose authority within their territory sometimes approached [[sovereignty]], even though they acknowledged the Holy Roman Emperor as [[suzerain]]; [[Prince-elector|Elector]], [[Grand Duke]], [[Margrave]], [[Landgrave]] and [[Count Palatine]], as well as secular princes like kings, dukes, princes and \"princely counts\" (''Gef\u00fcrstete Grafen''), and ecclesiastical princes like Prince-Archbishops, [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishops]] and Prince-Abbots. A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).\n\nThe table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title indicating sovereignty took precedence over any non-sovereign titleholder. \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Male]] version\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Female]] version\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|[[Realm]]\n!Notes and examples\n|-\n|[[Pope]]\n| ''[[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|Women cannot hold the office of Pope]]''\n|[[Papacy]]\n|Successor of St. Peter, Bishop of Rome, Head of the Roman Catholic Church, Monarch of the [[Papal States]] and later Sovereign of the State of [[Vatican City]]. As senior ruler in Medieval Christendom, the Pope held precedence over all other titles and offices. The Papacy is a celibate office always forbidden to women; in English however, reports of female popes such as ([[Pope Joan]]) refer to them as ''pope'' and ''[[Popess (disambiguation)|Popess]]''; the term is used, among other things, for the second trump in the [[Tarot]] deck''; some European languages also have a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian ''papessa'', the French ''papesse'', the Portuguese/Spanish ''papisa'' and the German ''P\u00e4pstin''.\n|-\n|[[Emperor]]\n|[[Empress]]\n|[[Empire]]\n| Today: [[Japan]] (the only remaining enthroned emperor in the world).

One of the titles of the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]] was ''Kaysar-i-R\u00fbm'' (Emperor of Rome), Kaysar being a rough transliteration of ''Caesar'' (Emperor) into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. ''Kaisar-i-Hind'', derived from the German word ''Kaiser'', was the [[Urdu]] translation of \"Emperor of India\".\n|-\n|[[King]]\n|[[Queen regnant|Queen]]\n|[[Monarchy|Kingdom]]\n|Common in larger sovereign states.

The title ''Vicer\u00e9'' was used in the [[Italian Colonial Empire]].

British version is [[Marquess]]. Although [[Margrave]] shares word-origin, in Germany it referred to rulers (of [[Margraviate]]s) rather than nobles.

British equivalent is [[Earl]] (whose female counterpart or wife is \"Countess\"). There are no remaining independent counties and the word county is used to denote an administrative district.

Vicomte is the equivalent in modern French. Vizconde is the equivalent in Spanish. The German ''Burggraf'' and Dutch ''Burggraaf'' are historical equivalents although they are not translated as \"Viscount\"; a rank above Baron but below Count. There are no remaining viscountcies but Viscount remains a title in Belgium, France, Spain and the UK.

Equivalent to King. The use of \"sultan\" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular \"malik\", which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. Current examples: [[Brunei]], [[Oman]], [[Monarchies of Malaysia|states of Malaysia]]. Historical examples: [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Sultanate]], [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Sultanate of Malacca]], Warsangali Sultanate.\n|-\n|[[Malik]]\n|Malikah/Malekeh\n|Mamlaka\n|Used throughout the [[Muslim world]]. Equivalent to King. In recent years, \"sultan\" has been gradually replaced by \"king\" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the rule of law. A notable example is Morocco, whose monarch changed his title from sultan to king in 1957. Current examples: [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]]. Also used by tribal leaders among the [[Pashtun people]]. Historical examples: ''[[List of Kings of Iraq|Malik al-'Iraq]]'' (\"King of Iraq\"), ''[[List of Kings of Yemen|Malik al-Mamlaka al-Mutawakkiliyya al-Yamaniyya]]'' (\"King of the Mutawakkilite Yemeni Kingdom\").\n|-\n|[[Khedive]]\n|\n|Khedivate \n|Largely equivalent to [[Viceroy]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

There are at least five cases of this:\n* [[Pretender|Claiming an existing title]], challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].\n* Retaining the title of an [[extinct monarchy]]. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies, e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the \"King of The Albanians\". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include \"[[King of Jerusalem]]\" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.\n* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised abroad]]. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the \"Prince of Sealand\", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title \"Emperor of the United States of America\" and later declared himself \"Protector of Mexico\".\n* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].\n* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as \"King of Rock and Roll\", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book | first = Philippe R. | last = Girard | year = 2011 | title = The Slaves Who Defeated Napoleon: Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian War of Independence 1801\u20131804 | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | publisher = The University of Alabama Press | isbn = 978-0-8173-1732-4 | ref = harv }}\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Schutt-Ain\u00e9\n| first = Patricia\n| authorlink =\n| title = Haiti: A Basic Reference Book\n| publisher = Librairie Au Service de la Culture\n| year = 1994\n| location = Miami, Florida\n| pages = 33\u201335, 60\n| isbn = 978-0-9638599-0-7 }}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.haitiwebs.com/emagazine/content/view/318/155/1/0/lang,en/ |last=TiCam |title=17 October: Death of Dessalines |publisher=haitiwebs.com |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928222734/http://www.haitiwebs.com/emagazine/content/view/318/155/1/0/lang%2Cen/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Politics|Royalty}}\n{{Wiktionary|monarch|kingship}}\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/odegard/titlefaq.htm A Glossary of European Noble, Princely, Royal and Imperial Titles]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114075322/http://starnarcosis.net/obsidian/regindex.html Regnal Chronologies] King lists worldwide\n*[http://www.archontology.org Archontology]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181225130229/http://imperialafrica.net/ African Kingdoms Imperial Throne Leadership and Enthronements]\n\n{{Monarchies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Monarchy|*]]\n[[Category:Monarchs|*]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch"}

She was the last living survivor who travelled second-class on the ship.\n\n==Early life==\nBarbara Joyce West was born in [[Bournemouth]], [[England]] on 24 May 1911 to Edwy Arthur West and Ada Mary Worth. Ada had given birth to a daughter, Constance, in 1907, and was pregnant with a third child when she boarded the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.\n\nEdwy decided to start a new life in the fruit culture business in [[Gainesville, Florida]] and, along with his expectant wife and two children, were emigrating there by way of the ''Titanic''.\n\n==Aboard ''Titanic''==\nBarbara, her parents and older sister, Constance, boarded the ''Titanic'' on 10 April 1912 at [[Southampton, England]] as second-class passengers. Barbara was just ten months and eighteen days old making her the second-youngest passenger on board the ship. In an interview, Barbara said that she could still recall the screams heard from the sinking ship, she also said that she remembers her father taking her to the boat deck and placing her in the boat, saying his farewell, the last time she would ever see him, and crying.\n\nWhen the ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg at 11:40 p.m, on 14 April 1912, Barbara was asleep in her cabin. Her mother, Ada, later recalled:\n<blockquote>\nWe were all asleep when the collision took place, but were only jolted in our berths-my husband and children not even being awakened, and it was only the hurrying of passengers outside the cabin that caused alarm. The steward made us all get up and dress thoroughly with plenty of warm things. Arthur placed lifebelts upon the children and then carried them to the boat deck. I followed carrying my handbag. After seeing us safely into the lifeboat, Arthur returned to the cabin for a thermos of hot milk, and, finding the lifeboat let down, he reached it by means of a rope, gave the flask to me, and, with a farewell, returned to the deck of the ship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/599/ |title=Mr Edwy Arthur West |website=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]] |date= |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBarbara, her mother and sister all survived the sinking and were picked up by the rescue ship ''Carpathia''. Her father, however, did not survive the sinking and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nThe surviving West family arrived in [[New York City]] aboard the ''Carpathia'' on 18 April. Upon their arrival, Ada booked passage for herself and her daughters aboard the [[White Star Line|White Star Line's]] {{RMS|Celtic}}. The ship arrived at [[Liverpool]], England on 6 May and Ada gave birth to a third daughter, Edwyna Joan, on 14 September.\n\nHer mother, Ada, died on 20 April 1953; aged 74 and her elder sister, Constance, died on 12 September 1963; aged 56. Barbara's sister, Edwyna, married a British diplomat and resided in England and the Bahamas.\n\n==Schooling and career==\nAs a child, Barbara attended the Worshipful Boarding School in [[Purley, London|Purley, England]] and went on to attend the [[Truro High School]] all-girls school and St. Luke's College in [[Exeter, England|Exeter]].<ref name=\"ET5751\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/5751/ |title=Obituary of Barbara Dainton |website=Encyclopedia Titanica |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> After college, Barbara became a governess to a Cornish family and moved with them to [[Spain]] until the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936. After returning to England, Barbara taught at a high school in [[Guildford, England]].\n\nIn the 1950s, Barbara taught at a school in [[Truro]], and later became deputy head of physical education at [[Plymstock School]] until 1972.<ref name=\"ET5751\"/>\n\n==Marriages==\nIn 1938, Barbara married Stanley Winder, a rugby player.

Barbara was married to her second husband, William Ernest Barrel Dainton, from 1952 until his death in 1990.<ref name=\"ET5751\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nThroughout her life, Barbara avoided all publicity associated with the ''Titanic''. As she aged and became one of only a handful of living survivors, interest in Barbara's story grew, but she refused to discuss the disaster outside her family circle, often saying she wanted 'nothing to do with the ''Titanic'' people'.<ref name=\"TEL\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1568791/Barbara-Dainton.html |title=Barbara Dainton |date=9 November 2007 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> She did, however, communicate sparingly with the British Titanic Society, but such communication was heavily guarded.<ref name=\"TEL\"/>\n\nHer later years saw her living in Truro, where she volunteered as a guide at the [[Truro Cathedral]] which contains a memorial tablet to her father.\n\n==Death==\nBarbara died on 16 October 2007 in Truro, Cornwall, at the age of 96.

Ada had given birth to a daughter, Constance, in 1907, and was pregnant with a third child when she boarded the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''.\n\nEdwy decided to start a new life in the fruit culture business in [[Gainesville, Florida]] and, along with his expectant wife and two children, were emigrating there by way of the ''Titanic''.\n\n==Aboard ''Titanic''==\nBarbara, her parents and older sister, Constance, boarded the ''Titanic'' on 10 April 1912 at [[Southampton, England]] as second-class passengers. Barbara was just ten months and eighteen days old making her the second-youngest passenger on board the ship. In an interview, Barbara said that she could still recall the screams heard from the sinking ship, she also said that she remembers her father taking her to the boat deck and placing her in the boat, saying his farewell, the last time she would ever see him, and crying.\n\nWhen the ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg at 11:40 p.m, on 14 April 1912, Barbara was asleep in her cabin. Her mother, Ada, later recalled:\n<blockquote>\nWe were all asleep when the collision took place, but were only jolted in our berths-my husband and children not even being awakened, and it was only the hurrying of passengers outside the cabin that caused alarm. The steward made us all get up and dress thoroughly with plenty of warm things. Arthur placed lifebelts upon the children and then carried them to the boat deck. I followed carrying my handbag. After seeing us safely into the lifeboat, Arthur returned to the cabin for a thermos of hot milk, and, finding the lifeboat let down, he reached it by means of a rope, gave the flask to me, and, with a farewell, returned to the deck of the ship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/biography/599/ |title=Mr Edwy Arthur West |website=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]] |date= |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBarbara, her mother and sister all survived the sinking and were picked up by the rescue ship ''Carpathia''. Her father, however, did not survive the sinking and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\n\nThe surviving West family arrived in [[New York City]] aboard the ''Carpathia'' on 18 April. Upon their arrival, Ada booked passage for herself and her daughters aboard the [[White Star Line|White Star Line's]] {{RMS|Celtic}}. The ship arrived at [[Liverpool]], England on 6 May and Ada gave birth to a third daughter, Edwyna Joan, on 14 September.\n\nHer mother, Ada, died on 20 April 1953; aged 74 and her elder sister, Constance, died on 12 September 1963; aged 56. Barbara's sister, Edwyna, married a British diplomat and resided in England and the Bahamas.\n\n==Schooling and career==\nAs a child, Barbara attended the Worshipful Boarding School in [[Purley, London|Purley, England]] and went on to attend the [[Truro High School]] all-girls school and St. Luke's College in [[Exeter, England|Exeter]].<ref name=\"ET5751\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/5751/ |title=Obituary of Barbara Dainton |website=Encyclopedia Titanica |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> After college, Barbara became a governess to a Cornish family and moved with them to [[Spain]] until the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936. After returning to England, Barbara taught at a high school in [[Guildford, England]].\n\nIn the 1950s, Barbara taught at a school in [[Truro]], and later became deputy head of physical education at [[Plymstock School]] until 1972.<ref name=\"ET5751\"/>\n\n==Marriages==\nIn 1938, Barbara married Stanley Winder, a rugby player. The two were married for 13 years before Stanley died of a heart attack in 1951. Barbara was married to her second husband, William Ernest Barrel Dainton, from 1952 until his death in 1990.<ref name=\"ET5751\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nThroughout her life, Barbara avoided all publicity associated with the ''Titanic''. As she aged and became one of only a handful of living survivors, interest in Barbara's story grew, but she refused to discuss the disaster outside her family circle, often saying she wanted 'nothing to do with the ''Titanic'' people'.<ref name=\"TEL\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1568791/Barbara-Dainton.html |title=Barbara Dainton |date=9 November 2007 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> She did, however, communicate sparingly with the British Titanic Society, but such communication was heavily guarded.<ref name=\"TEL\"/>\n\nHer later years saw her living in Truro, where she volunteered as a guide at the [[Truro Cathedral]] which contains a memorial tablet to her father.\n\n==Death==\nBarbara died on 16 October 2007 in Truro, Cornwall, at the age of 96. Her funeral was held on 5 November at Truro Cathedral. To avoid unwanted attention and maintain privacy, Barbara insisted that her funeral take place before any public announcement of her death.<ref>{{cite news |title=One of last Titanic survivors dies in England at age 96 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/08/europe/EU-GEN-Obit-Britain-Titanic-Survivor.php |agency=Associated Press |date=8 November 2007 |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |accessdate=12 January 2008}}</ref> Barbara's death made [[Millvina Dean]], then 95, of Southampton, England, the last living survivor of the ''Titanic'' sinking; Dean died 19 months later.<ref name=\"TEL\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Eaton |first1=John P. |last2=Haas |first2=Charles A. |date=1995 |edition=2nd |title=Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

[[Karachi]].</ref>\n\nIslamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as what happens before, during, and after the death, although what exactly happens is not clear and different [[Islamic schools and branches|schools of thought]] may end up with different conclusions. However, a continuity between all these ideas derived from the basic sources from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|Islamic narratives]]. One canonical idea is, that the [[Azrael#In Islam|angel of death]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Malak al-Maut'') appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in the most painful way while the righteous are treated easily\n\nAnother common idea, although appearing relatively late in Islamic traditions,<ref>Stephen Burge Angels in Islam: Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti's al-Haba'ik fi akhbar al-mala'ik Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-136-50473-0}} p. 89</ref> adds that, after the burial, two angels \u2013 [[Munkar and Nakir]] \u2013 come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.

[[Suicide]], [[euthanasia]], and [[Extrajudicial killings|unjust murder]] as means of death are all prohibited in Islam, and are considered major [[sin]]s.

Yet, the abode of the deceased is up to debate. They may either be in heaven/hell, in an intermediary state, or \"sleep\" until a great resurrection.\n\n==Significance==\nDeath is seen not as the termination of life, rather the continuation of life in another form. In Islamic belief, God has made this worldly life as a test and a preparation ground for the [[Afterlife#Islam|afterlife]]; and with death, this worldly life comes to an end.<ref name=Leaman-27>{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Oliver Leaman |encyclopedia= The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&pg=PA27|title=Al-akhira|publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|page=27}}</ref> Thus, every person has only one chance to prepare themselves for the life to come where [[God in Islam|God]] will resurrect and judge every individual and will entitle them to rewards or punishment, based on their good or bad deeds.<ref name=Leaman-27/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.\nMuslims expect that their last word in this world would be their [[Shahadah|profession of faith]] (which reads \"I testify that there is no god but [[Allah]], and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\"). That's why, those near a dying person encourage him to pronounce these words.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buturovic |first=Amila  |title=Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory: Death, Tombstones and Commemoration in Bosnian Islam Since C.1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABOrCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |page=35}}</ref> Sometimes, it is whispered into the ear of the dying.

Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. This willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.<ref name=Lester-2006/><ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's \u02be\u0101khirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic eschatology]]\n* [[Islamic funeral]]\n* [[Punishment of the Grave]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Islam and death| ]]\n[[Category:Islamic eschatology]]\n[[Category:Afterlife]]\n", "text_old": "'''Death in Islam''' is the termination of worldly life and the beginning of [[afterlife]].

However, a continuity between all these ideas derived from the basic sources from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|Islamic narratives]]. One canonical idea is, that the [[Azrael#In Islam|angel of death]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Malak al-Maut'') appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in the most painful way while the righteous are treated easily\n\nAnother common idea, although appearing relatively late in Islamic traditions,<ref>Stephen Burge Angels in Islam: Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti's al-Haba'ik fi akhbar al-mala'ik Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-136-50473-0}} p. 89</ref> adds that, after the burial, two angels \u2013 [[Munkar and Nakir]] \u2013 come to question the dead in order to test their faith.

Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body? ({{cite quran|56|83\u201384|s=ns|b=n}}). It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to God to go back to [[life]] to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted ({{cite quran|23|99\u2013100|s=ns|b=n}}). Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: \"Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid your full recompense.\" At another place, the Quran urges mankind: \"And die not except in a state of Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|102|s=ns|b=n}}) because \"Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam\" ({{cite quran|3|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Other verses related with this issue are: \"He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving\" ({{cite quran|67|2|s=ns|b=n}}); \"Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near\" ({{cite quran|70|6\u20137|s=ns|b=n}}).\n\n==Suicide==\n{{See also|Religious views on suicide#Islam}}\nIslam, as with other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic religions]], views [[suicide]] as one of the greatest sins and utterly detrimental to one's spiritual journey. The Islamic view is that life and death are given by God. Life is sacred, and a gift from God; and it is only God, and not the human beings, who has the right to take it back. This willful taking of one's own life is considered a major sin in Islam.<ref name=Lester-2006/><ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA641|title=Death |page=641}}</ref> Committing suicide to save oneself from suffering is discouraged.<ref name=Leaman-177/> Islam teaches that in the face of hardship, one should not directly pray for death. Instead, one should say: \"Oh Allah! Let me live as long as life is good for me, and let me die if death is good for me.\"<ref name=Leaman-177/> [[Euthanasia]] is considered one form of suicide and has the same ruling as that of suicide.<ref name=Leaman-177/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E.

[[Karachi]]. Chapter 17, verse 33.</ref>\n\n==Akhirah==\n{{main|Akhirah}}\n\u0100khirah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u0629) is an Islamic term referring to the afterlife. It is repeatedly referenced in chapters of the Quran concerning the Last Judgment, an important part of Islamic eschatology. Traditionally, it is considered to be one of the six main beliefs of Muslims. According to the Islamic beliefs, God will play the role of the qadi, weighing the deeds of each individual. He will decide whether that person's \u02be\u0101khirah lies in [[Jahannam]] (Hell) or [[Jannah]] (Heaven) on the basis of the weight of either good or bad deeds in comparison with one another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic eschatology]]\n* [[Islamic funeral]]\n* [[Punishment of the Grave]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Islam and death| ]]\n[[Category:Islamic eschatology]]\n[[Category:Afterlife]]\n", "name_user": "Jimmyjonesjohnson365255848342", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_death"}

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised [[Cilicia]] \u2013 [[\u0130skenderun]] and [[Mersin]], [[Iraq]] with [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].<ref>As cited by R, John and S.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

The Raiders compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. Founded on January 30, 1960, they played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) which [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] with the NFL in 1970. The Raiders will play their home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]] in 2020.\n\nOriginally based in [[Oakland, California]], the team departed Oakland to play in [[Los Angeles]] from the [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|1982 season]] through the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|1994 season]] before returning to Oakland at the start of the [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|1995 season]]. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' application to [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocate]] to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas.<ref name=\"JScottNFL\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jelani|title=Raiders officially announce 'Las Vegas Raiders' title|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001098555/article/raiders-officially-announce-las-vegas-raiders-title|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"LVRaiders\">{{cite news|author=Raiders Media Relations|title=Las Vegas Raiders - Silver and Black officially welcomed to the Silver State|url=https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Raiders.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation ([[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962]]) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|1963]], however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) [[Al Davis]]. In [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]], after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship]] that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to [[Super Bowl II]], where they were soundly defeated by the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships ([[1976\u201377 NFL playoffs|1976]], [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs|1980]], [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|1983]], and [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs|2002]]), 1 AFL Championship ([[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]), and 3 Super Bowl Championships ([[Super Bowl XI|XI]], [[Super Bowl XV|XV]], and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]]). At the end of the NFL's [[2019 NFL season|2019 season]], the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 473 wins, 432 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders Team Encyclopedia {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al's son [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]]. The Raiders are known for their [[Raider Nation|extensive fan base]] and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have 14 former members who have been enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. They have previously played at [[Kezar Stadium]] and [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, [[Frank Youell Field]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{See also|History of the Oakland Raiders|History of the Los Angeles Raiders}}\n===First Oakland era (1960\u20131981)===\n{{NFL Raiders history}}\nThe Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\"<ref>\"Grid Team Named-- They're Senors\", ''Oakland Tribune'', April 5, 1960, p37. Soda said, \"My own personal choice would have been Mavericks, but I believe we came up with a real fine name.\" The selection committee narrowed the choices down to Admirals, Lakers, Diablos, Seawolves, Gauchos, Nuggets, Se\u00f1ors, Dons, Costers, Grandees, Sequoias, Missiles, Knights, Redwoods, Clippers, Jets and Dolphins.</ref> after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching career at [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] during the 1950s, San Francisco native [[Eddie Erdelatz]] was hired as the Raiders' first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting offers from the NFL's [[Washington Redskins]] and the AFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers]], Erdelatz accepted the Raiders' head coaching position. In January 1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and because of NFL interference with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in the new [[American Football League]] to select players, thus relegated to the remaining talent available (see below).\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960 Raiders]] 42-man roster included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center [[Jim Otto]], and a future Raiders head coach, quarterback [[Tom Flores]]. In their debut year under Erdelatz the [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished with a 6\u20138 record.\n\nOn September 18, 1961, Erdelatz was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 77\u201346 in the first two games of the season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach [[Marty Feldman (American football coach)|Marty Feldman]] as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2\u201312 record.\n\nFeldman began the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962 season]] as Raiders head coach but was fired on October 16, 1962 after an 0\u20135 start. From October 16 through December, the Raiders were coached by Oklahoma native and former assistant coach [[Red Conkright]]. Under Conkright, the Raiders went 1\u20138, finishing the season with 1\u201313 record. Following the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position as they looked for a new head coach.\n\n====Al Davis====\nAfter the 1962 season, Raiders managing general partner [[F. Wayne Valley]] hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions.<ref name=\"youngest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |title=Raiders Stun Chargers with 33-Point 4th Quarter Outburst |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |work=Raiders.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230172729/http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the \"vertical game\", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach [[Sid Gillman]].<ref name=\"gillman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |title=Memories of Sid Gillman |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |work=Chargers.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090813/http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Under Davis the [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] improved to 10\u20134 and he was named the AFL's Coach of the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5\u20137\u20132 in [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]], they rebounded to an 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1965 Oakland Raiders season|1965]]. The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular season opening game on September 8, 1963. Prior to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals.\n\n====Davis's departure and return====\nIn April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach [[John Rauch]] to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. The leagues would retain separate regular seasons until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for $18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite magazine |last=Burke |first=Monte |title=A New Test For an Old Raider |magazine=Forbes Magazine |date =September 18, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |accessdate=January 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\">Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nUnder Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1966 Oakland Raiders season|1966]] but missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division.\n\n====First Super Bowl appearance: 1967 ====\nOn the field, the team Davis had assembled steadily improved. Led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], acquired in a trade with the [[Buffalo Bills]], the Raiders finished the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967 season]] with a 13\u20131 record and won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship]], defeating the [[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 40\u20137. The win earned the team a trip to the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami, Florida to participate in [[Super Bowl II]]. On January 14, 1968, the Raiders were defeated in the second-ever Super Bowl, losing 33\u201314 to [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nThe following year, the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] ended the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]] with a 12\u20132 record and again winning the AFL West Division title. However, this time, they lost 27\u201323 by the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].\n\nCiting management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head coaching job of the Buffalo Bills.\n\n====John Madden====\nDuring the early 1960s, [[John Madden]] was a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State University]] under SDSU head coach [[Don Coryell]]. Madden credited Coryell as being an influence on his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under Madden, the [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|1969 Raiders]] won the AFL West Division title for the third consecutive year with a 12\u20131\u20131 record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] 56\u20137 in the AFL Division playoff game. In the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship game]] on January 4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by [[Hank Stram]]'s [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 17\u20137.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL\u2013NFL merger was officially completed after four years and the Raiders joined the Western Division of the [[American Football Conference]] (actually the AFL West with the same teams as in 1969, except for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) in the newly-merged NFL. The first [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|post-merger season]] saw the Raiders win the AFC West with an 8\u20134\u20132 record and advance to the [[1970 AFC Championship Game|conference championship]], where they lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]. Despite another 8\u20134\u20132 season in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], it was only good for second place in the AFC West, and the team failed to make the playoffs. When backup offensive lineman [[Ron Mix]] played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive line with tackle [[Art Shell]], guard [[Gene Upshaw]], center Jim Otto, and tackle [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]].\n\n[[File:John Madden in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[John Madden]] was the head coach of the Raiders for 10 seasons. Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach.]]\nThe teams of the 1970s were thoroughly dominant teams, with eight Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with the crushing hits of safeties [[Jack Tatum]] and [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] and cornerback [[Skip Thomas]], the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached the conference championship every year.\n\nThis was also the era of a bitter rivalry between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Raiders. In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders were frequently the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The teams would meet on five different occasions in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in three of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.\n\nThe rivalry began with and was fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game in [[1972 NFL season|1972]]. That season the [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] achieved a 10\u20133\u20131 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, the Raiders would lose to the [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] 13\u20137 on the controversial play that become known as the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\".\n\nThe [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] would meet again the [[1973 NFL season|following season]] as the Raiders won the AFC West again with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by [[Ken Stabler]]. The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33\u201314 in the divisional round of the playoffs to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27\u201310 to the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] had a 12\u20132 regular season, which included a nine-game winning streak. They beat the [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] 28\u201326 in the divisional round of the playoffs in a see-saw battle remembered as the \"Sea of Hands\" game.<ref>National Football League lore</ref> They then lost the AFC Championship to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, and late mistakes turned a 10\u20133 lead at the start of the fourth quarter into a disappointing 24\u201313 loss.\n\nIn the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] opener, the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] beat [[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11\u20133 record, they defeated [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] 31\u201328 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the conference championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines \u2013 the deep threat, or 'long ball' \u2013 more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16\u201310. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] came from behind dramatically to beat [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] 31\u201328 in the season opener and continued to cement its reputation for dirty play by knocking WR [[Lynn Swann]] out for two weeks with a clothesline to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] for libel after the latter called safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] a criminal for the hit. The Raiders won 13 regular season games and a close controversial 21\u201317 victory over [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England]] in the divisional playoffs. With the Patriots up by three points in final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith called roughing the passer on New England's [[Ray Hamilton|Ray \"Sugar Bear\" Hamilton]] after he hit Oakland QB Ken Stabler. The Raiders went on to score a touchdown in the final minute to win. They then defeated the Steelers 24\u20137 in the AFC Championship to advance to their second Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XI]], Oakland's opponent was the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. The Raiders jumped out to an early lead and led 16\u20130 at halftime. By the end, having forced Minnesota into multiple turnovers, the Raiders won 32\u201314 for their first Super Bowl and post-merger championship.\n\nThe [[1977 NFL season|following season]] saw the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finish 11\u20133, but they lost the division title to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. They settled for a wild card, beating the [[1977 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] in the second-longest overtime game in NFL history and which featured the [[Ghost to the Post]]. however, the Raiders then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.\n\nDuring a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR [[Darryl Stingley]] was injured by a hit from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|1978 Raiders]] achieved a winning record at 9\u20137, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1971, losing critical games down the stretch to miss the playoffs.\n\n====Tom Flores====\nAfter 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super Bowl championship, John Madden left coaching in 1979 to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement was former Raiders quarterback [[Tom Flores]], the first Hispanic head coach in NFL history.<ref name=\"hispanic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |title=1980 Raiders were outcasts, champions |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123200328/http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Flores led the [[1979 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to another 9\u20137 [[1979 NFL season|season]], but the team missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis' attempts to move the team to Los Angeles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Flores looked to lead the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to their third Super Bowl by finishing the season 11\u20135 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter [[Dan Pastorini]] was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the [[1980 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], sending the beloved [[Ken Stabler]] to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the [[1980 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 14\u201312. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XV]], the Raiders faced head coach [[Dick Vermeil]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14\u20130 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running back [[Kenny King (running back)|Kenny King]]. A [[Cliff Branch]] third quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21\u20133 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27\u201310, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.\n\n===Los Angeles era (1982\u20131994)===\nIn 1980 Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]], specifically the addition of [[luxury box]]es. That year, he signed a [[memorandum of agreement]] to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22\u20130 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an [[injunction]]. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit filed by the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] (who had recently lost the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]]), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 168.</ref> After the first case was declared a [[Trial|mistrial]], in May 1982, a second jury found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"moveone\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223180421/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2002 |title=Al Davis biography |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |work=HickokSports.com}}</ref><ref name=\"movetwo\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |title=Good guys wear black |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Puma |first=Mike |date=December 1, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN Classic]]}}</ref> With the ruling, the Raiders would relocate to Los Angeles for the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to play their home games at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of [[1981 Oakland Raiders season|1981]] saw the team fall to a 7\u20139 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win.\n\nThe newly minted [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] finished the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] 8\u20131 to win the AFC West, but lost in the second round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the [[1982 New York Jets season|Jets]]. The [[1983 NFL season|following season]], the [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] finished 12\u20134 to win the AFC West. Convincing playoff wins over the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]] propelled the Raiders to their fourth Super Bowl. Against the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVIII]], the Raiders built a lead after blocking a punt and recovering for a touchdown early in the game. A Branch touchdown reception from Plunkett put the Raiders up 14\u20130 with more than nine minutes remaining in the first quarter. With seven seconds remaining in the first half, linebacker [[Jack Squirek]] intercepted a [[Joe Theismann]] [[swing pass]] at the Washington five-yard line and scored, sending the Raiders to a 21\u20133 halftime lead. Following a [[John Riggins]] one-yard touchdown run (extra point was blocked), [[Marcus Allen]] scored from five yards out to build the lead to 28\u20139. The Raiders sealed the game with Allen reversed his route on a Super Bowl record run that turned into a 74-yard touchdown. The Raiders went on to a 38\u20139 victory and their third NFL championship. Allen set a record for most rushing yards (191) and combined yards (209) in a Super Bowl as the Raiders won their third Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n[[File:1985 Police Raiders-Rams - 01 Marcus Allen (crop).jpg|thumb|230px|left|Raiders' Hall of Famer [[Marcus Allen]] is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League history.]]\nThe [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|team]] had another successful regular season in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], finishing 11\u20135, but a three-game losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they fell to the [[1984 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nThe [[1985 Los Angeles Raiders season|1985 Raiders]] campaign saw 12 wins and a division title as Marcus Allen was named MVP. However, a loss to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] derailed any further postseason hopes.\n\nThe Raiders' fortunes declined after that, and from [[1986 Los Angeles Raiders season|1986]] to [[1989 Los Angeles Raiders season|1989]], they finished no better than 8\u20138 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961\u201362. Also in 1986, Al Davis got into a widely publicized argument with Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|1987]], and Davis retaliated by signing [[Bo Jackson]] to essentially replace Allen. However, Jackson was also a [[left fielder]] for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Kansas City Royals]], and could not play full-time until baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]] cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1\u20132 record before the regular players returned after the strike. After a weak 5\u201310 finish, Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive assistant coach [[Mike Shanahan]].\n\nShanahan led the team to a 7\u20139 season in [[1988 Los Angeles Raiders season|1988]], and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the [[1988 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] was scheduled at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 234.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1986, Davis sought to abandon the Coliseum in favor of a more modern stadium. In addition to sharing the venue with the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]], the Raiders were less than ecstatic with the Coliseum as it was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 230.</ref> Finally, the Coliseum had 95,000 seats and the Raiders were rarely able to fill all of them even in their best years, and so most Raiders home games were blacked out in Southern California. Numerous sites in California were considered, including one near now-defunct [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where [[SoFi Stadium]] for the Rams and Chargers is under construction, and another in [[Carson, California|Carson]]. In August 1987 it was announced that the city of [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] paid Davis US$10&nbsp;million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium site.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 232.</ref> When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit.<ref name=\"deposit\">{{cite news |title=Al Davis may retire if Raiders win |url=http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102133117/http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"irwindale\">{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Plaschke |title=Shades of Gray |url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804232618/http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> During this time Davis also almost moved the team to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in a deal that would have included Davis becoming the managing partner of the [[Sacramento Kings]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/sacramento-raiders-it-was-done-deal|title=Sacramento Raiders?

Oakland lost the 1969 AFL Championship against Kansas City, who went on to beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders have lost 17 out of 20 regular season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10\u2013game losing streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs 10\u20136 in the Wild Card round on December 28, 1991. On September 8, 1996, the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the first time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33-yard field goal kick made by Joe Nedney. The Chiefs lead the overall series '''64\u201353\u20132''', and are the only team in the AFC West that the Raiders have a losing record against. Oakland currently has defeated Kansas City just twice since the 2012 NFL season. Until October 19, 2017 - when they defeated the Chiefs, 31\u201330 on a game-tying touchdown on the last play of the game, leading to a game winning PAT - the Raiders had lost five straight to the Chiefs, their previous win against them being in the 2014 season.\n\n;Denver Broncos\n{{Further|Broncos\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 47 - Randy Gradishar.jpg|right|thumb|The Raiders playing against the Broncos in the [[1977-78 NFL playoffs|1977-78 AFC Championship Game]].]]\nThe Raiders' rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], is considered to be one of the most heated and well known rivalries in NFL history. The Raiders managed a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, which lasted until October 22, 1972, when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30\u201323. While the Raiders still hold the advantage in the all-time series '''63\u201353\u20132''', the Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival of Broncos head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], through the 2008 season. Shanahan coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, which has only served to intensify this rivalry. On October 24, 2010, the Raiders beat the Broncos (59\u201314), giving the Raiders the most points scored in a game in the team's history. On December 13, 2015, the Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15\u201312) by a spectacular performance from their defense allowing 4 field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack who recorded 5 sacks in that game against Denver which is tied the most sacks in franchise along with Howie Long. The Broncos reached their first ever Super Bowl when they defeated the Raiders 20\u201317 in the AFC Championship Game. The two teams have faced off on Monday Night Football a total of 19 times, making it the most frequent Monday Night matchup in NFL history. \n\n;Los Angeles Chargers\n{{Further|Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Chargers]]' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. The Raiders held a streak without losing to the Chargers with a 16\u20130\u20132 record from 1968 to 1977. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial play. In January 1981 the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34\u201327. The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 27\u201310. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28\u201324. On October 10, 2010, the Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the San Diego Chargers with a score of 35\u201327. The Raiders hold the overall series advantage at '''63\u201354\u20132'''.\n\n===Historical rivals===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2018 season the Raiders lead the regular season series 13 wins to 10, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3\u20133. The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s, and considered by many to be one of most vicious and brutal in the history of Professional football. From 1972 to 1976 the teams would meet in the playoffs five consecutive times, including three consecutive AFC Championship games. The rivalry really kicked off during the teams\u2019 first playoff meeting at the 1972 AFC divisional round in Pittsburgh. Considered to be one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\", as it was dubbed, saw the Steelers beat the Raiders on a controversial last second play. During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]], which left him concussed. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson again hit Swann, this time with a forearm to the head, causing yet another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Atkinson as part of the \"criminal element\" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2&nbsp;million [[defamation]] lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.<ref name=\"atkinson\">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Smizik |title=Raiders of the lost rivalry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108175110/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The rivalry reached its apex in the late 1980s, cooled when the teams faced each other only sporadically, then headed up again in the late 1990s before cooling again.\n\nThe four most recent contests between the Raiders and Steelers harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition. On December 6, 2009, the 3\u20138 Raiders helped spoil the [[Super Bowl XLIII|defending champions]]' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a [[Louis Murphy]] touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27\u201324 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35\u20133 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was punched by Raiders defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] following a touchdown. On November 8, 2015, the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38\u201335 victory. During the game, the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]] to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. However, in 2018, the Raiders upset the Steelers again, scoring a late touchdown to take a 24\u201321 fourth-quarter lead and getting the last laugh when Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] slipped and missed a game-tying field goal. This game, which will likely be the teams' final matchup in Oakland, contributed to the Steelers' late-season collapse and missing the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset of Steelers, 24-21 |publisher=CBS San Francisco |work=The Associated Press |date=9 December 2018 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531012748/https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe rivalry between the Raiders and [[New England Patriots]] dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety [[Jack Tatum]]. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The [[Ben Dreith]] Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the team hosted New England in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by New England and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for [[Matt Millen]] attacking Patriots GM [[Patrick Sullivan (American football executive)|Patrick Sullivan]] with his helmet. The two teams met in a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|divisional-round]] playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"[[Tuck Rule Game]]\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"pats\">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Halley |title=Patriots-Raiders: No love lost over time |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular season contests between the two teams.

The Raiders faced the Dolphins twice in the early 1970s; the Dolphins defeated the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Championship Game 27\u201310 on their way to [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The next year in the divisional playoffs the Raiders trailed Miami 26\u201321; in the final minute the Raiders drove to the Miami eight-yard line; a desperation pass by [[Ken Stabler]] was caught in traffic by [[Clarence Davis]] in the play known as the \"Sea of Hands.\"\n\nThe Raiders faced the Houston Oilers throughout the AFL era and twice in AFL playoffs in the late 1960s, winning 40\u20137 in 1967 on their way to [[Super Bowl II]] and 56\u20137 in the 1969 divisional playoffs. Oakland defeated the Oilers in the 1980 Wild Card playoffs 27\u20137 and defeated the Titans in the 2002 AFC Championship Game 41\u201324.\n\n====Historic battle of the Bay rivalry====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[San Francisco 49ers]], located on the other side of [[San Francisco Bay]], were the Raiders' geographic rivals during the Raiders' time in Oakland. The first exhibition game, played in 1967, ended with the 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. As a result, games between the two are referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups happen only once every four years. Fans and players of the winning team could claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area.\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]], including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\nThe series ended on November 1, 2018, during a Thursday Night Football broadcast at Levi's Stadium, marking the last time both teams would meet before the Raiders moved to their new home in Las Vegas. The 49ers won the game 34-3 to tie their regular season series at 7.\n\n====Historic battle for Los Angeles rivalry====\nAs mentioned earlier, the Raiders and [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a rivalry during the 13 years both teams shared the Los Angeles market. The teams met six times in the regular season in this period; the Raiders won the first meeting of this era, 37\u201331, on December 18, 1982. The Raiders won four of their six games against the Rams while the teams shares the Los Angeles market.\n\n==Ownership, administration and financial operations==\n\n===Founding of the franchise===\nMax Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in the NFL. This was after the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL.\n\nAfter the AFL's first draft, in which players were selected for the then nameless Minneapolis franchise, Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's '[[Foolish Club]]'.\n\nThe city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, the team was named the Raiders.<ref name=\"hof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame \u2013 Oakland Raiders |accessdate=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230070530/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 7.</ref> Because many of the defunct Minneapolis franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players that could be chosen by the Raiders.\n\nThe Minneapolis group did not take with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter franchise in the [[American Football League]]. One reason they were so weak in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not make quality players available in the allocation draft.\n\nAt the time, Oakland seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. However, the AFL owners selected Oakland after [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner [[Barron Hilton]] threatened to forfeit his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople willing to invest in the new team. A [[limited partnership]] was formed to own the team headed by managing general partner [[Chet Soda|Y. Charles (Chet) Soda]] (1908\u201389), a local real estate developer, and included general partners Ed McGah (1899\u20131983), Robert Osborne (1898\u20131968), [[F. Wayne Valley]] (1914\u201386), restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914\u201382), Don Blessing (1904\u20132000), and contractor Charles Harney (1902\u201362)<ref>Harney was the builder of San Francisco's Candlestick Park, built on a bleak parcel of land he owned; to date, the road leading to the stadium is known as Harney Way. With a push from Harney, the Raiders were allowed to play their final three 1960 home games at Candlestick.</ref> as well as numerous limited partners.\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished their first campaign with a 6\u20138 record, and lost $500,000. Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received a $400,000 loan from [[Buffalo Bills]] founder [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]]<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner.\n\nIn 1962 Valley hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as head coach and general manager. In April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US$18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\"/><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\"/>\n\nIn 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several weeks attending the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted a revised partnership agreement that gave him total control over all of the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. Under partnership law, by a 2\u20131 vote of the general partners, the new agreement was thus ratified. Valley was furious when he discovered this, and immediately filed suit to have the new agreement overturned, but the court sided with Davis and McGah.\n\nIn 1976 Valley sold his interest in the team, and Davis \u2013 who now owned only 25% of the Raiders \u2013 was firmly in charge.<ref name=\"burke\" /><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\n====Current ownership structure====\nLegally, the club is a limited partnership with nine partners \u2013 Davis' heirs and the heirs of the original eight team partners. From 1972 onward, Davis had exercised near-complete control as president of the team's general partner, A.D. Football, Inc.

The younger McGah was himself a part-owner of the team, as a limited partner, and died in 2002. Several members of the McGah family filed suit against Davis in October 2003, alleging mismanagement of the team by Davis. The lawsuit sought monetary damages and to remove Davis and A. D.

Among their specific complaints, the McGahs alleged that Davis failed to provide them with detailed financial information previously provided to Ed and E.J. McGah. The Raiders countered that\u2014under the terms of the partnership agreement as amended in 1972\u2014upon the death of the elder McGah in 1983, his general partner interest converted to that of a limited partner.

'''[[Allegiant Stadium]] (planned for 2020) '''\n}}\n\nThe '''Las Vegas Raiders''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas metropolitan area]]. The Raiders compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. Founded on January 30, 1960, they played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) which [[AFL-NFL merger|merged]] with the NFL in 1970. The Raiders will play their home games at [[Allegiant Stadium]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]] in 2020.\n\nOriginally based in [[Oakland, California]], the team departed Oakland to play in [[Los Angeles]] from the [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|1982 season]] through the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|1994 season]] before returning to Oakland at the start of the [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|1995 season]]. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' application to [[Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas|relocate]] to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders officially moved to Las Vegas.<ref name=\"JScottNFL\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Jelani|title=Raiders officially announce 'Las Vegas Raiders' title|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001098555/article/raiders-officially-announce-las-vegas-raiders-title|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"LVRaiders\">{{cite news|author=Raiders Media Relations|title=Las Vegas Raiders - Silver and Black officially welcomed to the Silver State|url=https://www.raiders.com/news/las-vegas-raiders-silver-and-black-officially-welcomed-to-the-silver-state|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Raiders.com|date=January 22, 2020|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation ([[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962]]) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|1963]], however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) [[Al Davis]]. In [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]], after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship]] that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to [[Super Bowl II]], where they were soundly defeated by the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships ([[1976\u201377 NFL playoffs|1976]], [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs|1980]], [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|1983]], and [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs|2002]]), 1 AFL Championship ([[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]), and 3 Super Bowl Championships ([[Super Bowl XI|XI]], [[Super Bowl XV|XV]], and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]]). At the end of the NFL's [[2019 NFL season|2019 season]], the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 473 wins, 432 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/|title=Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders Team Encyclopedia {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al's son [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]]. The Raiders are known for their [[Raider Nation|extensive fan base]] and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have 14 former members who have been enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. They have previously played at [[Kezar Stadium]] and [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, [[Frank Youell Field]] and [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in Los Angeles.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{See also|History of the Oakland Raiders|History of the Los Angeles Raiders}}\n===First Oakland era (1960\u20131981)===\n{{NFL Raiders history}}\nThe Oakland Raiders were originally going to be called the \"Oakland Se\u00f1ors\"<ref>\"Grid Team Named-- They're Senors\", ''Oakland Tribune'', April 5, 1960, p37. Soda said, \"My own personal choice would have been Mavericks, but I believe we came up with a real fine name.\" The selection committee narrowed the choices down to Admirals, Lakers, Diablos, Seawolves, Gauchos, Nuggets, Se\u00f1ors, Dons, Costers, Grandees, Sequoias, Missiles, Knights, Redwoods, Clippers, Jets and Dolphins.</ref> after a name-the-team contest had that name finish first, but after being the target of local jokes, the name was changed to the Raiders before the 1960 season began. Having enjoyed a successful collegiate coaching career at [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] during the 1950s, San Francisco native [[Eddie Erdelatz]] was hired as the Raiders' first head coach. On February 9, 1960, after rejecting offers from the NFL's [[Washington Redskins]] and the AFL's [[Los Angeles Chargers]], Erdelatz accepted the Raiders' head coaching position. In January 1960, the Raiders were established in Oakland, and because of NFL interference with the original eighth franchise owner, were the last team of eight in the new [[American Football League]] to select players, thus relegated to the remaining talent available (see below).\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|1960 Raiders]] 42-man roster included 28 rookies and only 14 veterans. Among the Raiders rookies were future Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee center [[Jim Otto]], and a future Raiders head coach, quarterback [[Tom Flores]]. In their debut year under Erdelatz the [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished with a 6\u20138 record.\n\nOn September 18, 1961, Erdelatz was dismissed after the Raiders were outscored 77\u201346 in the first two games of the season. On September 24, 1961, after the dismissal of Erdelatz, management named Los Angeles native and offensive line coach [[Marty Feldman (American football coach)|Marty Feldman]] as the Raiders head coach. The team finished the 1961 season with a 2\u201312 record.\n\nFeldman began the [[1962 Oakland Raiders season|1962 season]] as Raiders head coach but was fired on October 16, 1962 after an 0\u20135 start. From October 16 through December, the Raiders were coached by Oklahoma native and former assistant coach [[Red Conkright]]. Under Conkright, the Raiders went 1\u20138, finishing the season with 1\u201313 record. Following the 1962 season the Raiders appointed Conkright to an interim mentor position as they looked for a new head coach.\n\n====Al Davis====\nAfter the 1962 season, Raiders managing general partner [[F. Wayne Valley]] hired Al Davis as Raiders head coach and general manager. At 33, he was the youngest person in professional football history to hold the positions.<ref name=\"youngest\">{{cite web |url=http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |title=Raiders Stun Chargers with 33-Point 4th Quarter Outburst |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |work=Raiders.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230172729/http://www.raiders.com/history/gm11.jsp |archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> Davis immediately began to implement what he termed the \"vertical game\", an aggressive offensive strategy inspired by the offense developed by Chargers head coach [[Sid Gillman]].<ref name=\"gillman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |title=Memories of Sid Gillman |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |work=Chargers.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090813/http://www.chargers.com/news/headlines/news-104158080019831.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Under Davis the [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] improved to 10\u20134 and he was named the AFL's Coach of the Year in 1963. Though the team slipped to 5\u20137\u20132 in [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]], they rebounded to an 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1965 Oakland Raiders season|1965]]. The famous silver and black Raider uniform debuted at the regular season opening game on September 8, 1963. Prior to this, the team wore a combination of black and white with gold trim on the pants and oversized numerals.\n\n====Davis's departure and return====\nIn April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner, promoting assistant coach [[John Rauch]] to head coach. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. The leagues would retain separate regular seasons until [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part-owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for $18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite magazine |last=Burke |first=Monte |title=A New Test For an Old Raider |magazine=Forbes Magazine |date =September 18, 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2006/0918/112.html |accessdate=January 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\">Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 41.</ref>\n\nUnder Rauch, the Raiders matched their 1965 season's 8\u20135\u20131 record in [[1966 Oakland Raiders season|1966]] but missed the playoffs, finishing second in the AFL West Division.\n\n====First Super Bowl appearance: 1967 ====\nOn the field, the team Davis had assembled steadily improved. Led by quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]], acquired in a trade with the [[Buffalo Bills]], the Raiders finished the [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967 season]] with a 13\u20131 record and won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship]], defeating the [[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] 40\u20137. The win earned the team a trip to the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami, Florida to participate in [[Super Bowl II]]. On January 14, 1968, the Raiders were defeated in the second-ever Super Bowl, losing 33\u201314 to [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nThe following year, the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] ended the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]] with a 12\u20132 record and again winning the AFL West Division title. However, this time, they lost 27\u201323 by the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].\n\nCiting management conflicts with day-to-day coaching decisions, Rauch resigned as Raiders head coach on January 16, 1969, accepting the head coaching job of the Buffalo Bills.\n\n====John Madden====\nDuring the early 1960s, [[John Madden]] was a defensive assistant coach at [[San Diego State University]] under SDSU head coach [[Don Coryell]]. Madden credited Coryell as being an influence on his coaching. In 1967, Madden was hired by Al Davis as the Raiders linebacker coach. On February 4, 1969, after the departure of John Rauch, Madden was named the Raiders sixth head coach. Under Madden, the [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|1969 Raiders]] won the AFL West Division title for the third consecutive year with a 12\u20131\u20131 record. On December 20, 1969, the Raiders defeated the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] 56\u20137 in the AFL Division playoff game. In the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship game]] on January 4, 1970, the Raiders were defeated by [[Hank Stram]]'s [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 17\u20137.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL\u2013NFL merger was officially completed after four years and the Raiders joined the Western Division of the [[American Football Conference]] (actually the AFL West with the same teams as in 1969, except for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) in the newly-merged NFL. The first [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|post-merger season]] saw the Raiders win the AFC West with an 8\u20134\u20132 record and advance to the [[1970 AFC Championship Game|conference championship]], where they lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]]. Despite another 8\u20134\u20132 season in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], it was only good for second place in the AFC West, and the team failed to make the playoffs. When backup offensive lineman [[Ron Mix]] played, the 1971 Raiders had an eventual all-Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive line with tackle [[Art Shell]], guard [[Gene Upshaw]], center Jim Otto, and tackle [[Bob Brown (offensive lineman)|Bob Brown]].\n\n[[File:John Madden in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[John Madden]] was the head coach of the Raiders for 10 seasons. Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach.]]\nThe teams of the 1970s were thoroughly dominant teams, with eight Hall of Fame inductees on the roster and a Hall of Fame coach in John Madden. The 1970s Raiders created the team's identity and persona as a team that was hard-hitting. Dominant on defense, with the crushing hits of safeties [[Jack Tatum]] and [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] and cornerback [[Skip Thomas]], the Raiders regularly held first place in the AFC West, entering the playoffs nearly every season. From 1973 through 1977, the Raiders reached the conference championship every year.\n\nThis was also the era of a bitter rivalry between the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Raiders. In the 1970s, the Steelers and Raiders were frequently the two best teams in the AFC and, arguably, the NFL. The teams would meet on five different occasions in the playoffs, and the winner of the Steelers-Raiders game went on to win the Super Bowl in three of those instances, from 1974 to 1976. The rivalry garnered attention in the sports media, with controversial plays, late hits, accusations and public statements.\n\nThe rivalry began with and was fueled by a controversial last-second play in their first playoff game in [[1972 NFL season|1972]]. That season the [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] achieved a 10\u20133\u20131 record and an AFC West title. In the divisional round, the Raiders would lose to the [[1972 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] 13\u20137 on the controversial play that become known as the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\".\n\nThe [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] would meet again the [[1973 NFL season|following season]] as the Raiders won the AFC West again with a 9\u20134\u20131 record. Lamonica was replaced as starting quarterback early in the season by [[Ken Stabler]]. The Raiders defeated Pittsburgh 33\u201314 in the divisional round of the playoffs to reach the AFC Championship, but lost 27\u201310 to the [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[1974 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] had a 12\u20132 regular season, which included a nine-game winning streak. They beat the [[1974 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] 28\u201326 in the divisional round of the playoffs in a see-saw battle remembered as the \"Sea of Hands\" game.<ref>National Football League lore</ref> They then lost the AFC Championship to the [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], who went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders were held to only 29 yards rushing by the Pittsburgh defense, and late mistakes turned a 10\u20133 lead at the start of the fourth quarter into a disappointing 24\u201313 loss.\n\nIn the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] opener, the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] beat [[1975 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] and ended their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11\u20133 record, they defeated [[1975 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] 31\u201328 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the conference championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines \u2013 the deep threat, or 'long ball' \u2013 more so than the Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make quick moves to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16\u201310. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.\n\nIn [[1976 NFL season|1976]], the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] came from behind dramatically to beat [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] 31\u201328 in the season opener and continued to cement its reputation for dirty play by knocking WR [[Lynn Swann]] out for two weeks with a clothesline to the helmet. Al Davis later tried to sue Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] for libel after the latter called safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] a criminal for the hit. The Raiders won 13 regular season games and a close controversial 21\u201317 victory over [[1976 New England Patriots season|New England]] in the divisional playoffs. With the Patriots up by three points in final two minutes, referee Ben Dreith called roughing the passer on New England's [[Ray Hamilton|Ray \"Sugar Bear\" Hamilton]] after he hit Oakland QB Ken Stabler. The Raiders went on to score a touchdown in the final minute to win. They then defeated the Steelers 24\u20137 in the AFC Championship to advance to their second Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XI]], Oakland's opponent was the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], a team that had lost three previous Super Bowls. The Raiders jumped out to an early lead and led 16\u20130 at halftime. By the end, having forced Minnesota into multiple turnovers, the Raiders won 32\u201314 for their first Super Bowl and post-merger championship.\n\nThe [[1977 NFL season|following season]] saw the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finish 11\u20133, but they lost the division title to the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. They settled for a wild card, beating the [[1977 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] in the second-longest overtime game in NFL history and which featured the [[Ghost to the Post]]. however, the Raiders then fell to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.\n\nDuring a 1978 preseason game, Patriots WR [[Darryl Stingley]] was injured by a hit from Raiders FS Jack Tatum and paralyzed for life. Although the [[1978 Oakland Raiders season|1978 Raiders]] achieved a winning record at 9\u20137, they missed the playoffs for the first time since 1971, losing critical games down the stretch to miss the playoffs.\n\n====Tom Flores====\nAfter 10 consecutive winning seasons and one Super Bowl championship, John Madden left coaching in 1979 to pursue a career as a television football commentator. His replacement was former Raiders quarterback [[Tom Flores]], the first Hispanic head coach in NFL history.<ref name=\"hispanic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |title=1980 Raiders were outcasts, champions |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123200328/http://www.nfl.com/insider/2001/raidersnewhouse_091801.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007}}</ref> Flores led the [[1979 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to another 9\u20137 [[1979 NFL season|season]], but the team missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the midst of the turmoil of Al Davis' attempts to move the team to Los Angeles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Flores looked to lead the [[1980 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to their third Super Bowl by finishing the season 11\u20135 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter [[Dan Pastorini]] was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the [[1980 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], sending the beloved [[Ken Stabler]] to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the [[1980 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] 14\u201312. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XV]], the Raiders faced head coach [[Dick Vermeil]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14\u20130 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running back [[Kenny King (running back)|Kenny King]]. A [[Cliff Branch]] third quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21\u20133 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27\u201310, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.\n\n===Los Angeles era (1982\u20131994)===\nIn 1980 Al Davis attempted unsuccessfully to have improvements made to the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]], specifically the addition of [[luxury box]]es. That year, he signed a [[memorandum of agreement]] to move the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles. The move, which required three-fourths approval by league owners, was defeated 22\u20130 (with five owners abstaining). When Davis tried to move the team anyway, he was blocked by an [[injunction]]. In response, the Raiders not only became an active partner in an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit filed by the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] (who had recently lost the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]]), but filed an antitrust lawsuit of their own.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 168.</ref> After the first case was declared a [[Trial|mistrial]], in May 1982, a second jury found in favor of Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, clearing the way for the move.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"moveone\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223180421/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/davisall.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 23, 2002 |title=Al Davis biography |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |work=HickokSports.com}}</ref><ref name=\"movetwo\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_davis_al.html |title=Good guys wear black |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |last=Puma |first=Mike |date=December 1, 2003 |publisher=[[ESPN Classic]]}}</ref> With the ruling, the Raiders would relocate to Los Angeles for the [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] to play their home games at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Raiders' final campaign of their first run in Oakland of [[1981 Oakland Raiders season|1981]] saw the team fall to a 7\u20139 record, failing to make the playoffs following their Super Bowl win.\n\nThe newly minted [[1982 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] finished the [[1982 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]] 8\u20131 to win the AFC West, but lost in the second round of the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] to the [[1982 New York Jets season|Jets]]. The [[1983 NFL season|following season]], the [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] finished 12\u20134 to win the AFC West. Convincing playoff wins over the [[1983 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[1983\u201384 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]] propelled the Raiders to their fourth Super Bowl. Against the [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVIII]], the Raiders built a lead after blocking a punt and recovering for a touchdown early in the game. A Branch touchdown reception from Plunkett put the Raiders up 14\u20130 with more than nine minutes remaining in the first quarter. With seven seconds remaining in the first half, linebacker [[Jack Squirek]] intercepted a [[Joe Theismann]] [[swing pass]] at the Washington five-yard line and scored, sending the Raiders to a 21\u20133 halftime lead. Following a [[John Riggins]] one-yard touchdown run (extra point was blocked), [[Marcus Allen]] scored from five yards out to build the lead to 28\u20139. The Raiders sealed the game with Allen reversed his route on a Super Bowl record run that turned into a 74-yard touchdown. The Raiders went on to a 38\u20139 victory and their third NFL championship. Allen set a record for most rushing yards (191) and combined yards (209) in a Super Bowl as the Raiders won their third Super Bowl in eight years.\n\n[[File:1985 Police Raiders-Rams - 01 Marcus Allen (crop).jpg|thumb|230px|left|Raiders' Hall of Famer [[Marcus Allen]] is considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in National Football League history.]]\nThe [[1984 Los Angeles Raiders season|team]] had another successful regular season in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], finishing 11\u20135, but a three-game losing streak forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card, where they fell to the [[1984 Seattle Seahawks season|Seahawks]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nThe [[1985 Los Angeles Raiders season|1985 Raiders]] campaign saw 12 wins and a division title as Marcus Allen was named MVP. However, a loss to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|Patriots]] derailed any further postseason hopes.\n\nThe Raiders' fortunes declined after that, and from [[1986 Los Angeles Raiders season|1986]] to [[1989 Los Angeles Raiders season|1989]], they finished no better than 8\u20138 and posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1961\u201362. Also in 1986, Al Davis got into a widely publicized argument with Marcus Allen, whom he accused of faking injuries. The feud continued into [[1987 Los Angeles Raiders season|1987]], and Davis retaliated by signing [[Bo Jackson]] to essentially replace Allen. However, Jackson was also a [[left fielder]] for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Kansas City Royals]], and could not play full-time until baseball season ended in October. Even worse, another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]] cost the NFL one game and prompted them to use substitute players. The Raiders achieved a 1\u20132 record before the regular players returned after the strike. After a weak 5\u201310 finish, Tom Flores moved to the front office and was replaced by Denver Broncos offensive assistant coach [[Mike Shanahan]].\n\nShanahan led the team to a 7\u20139 season in [[1988 Los Angeles Raiders season|1988]], and Allen and Jackson continued to trade places as the starting running back. Low game attendance and fan apathy were evident by this point, and in the summer of 1988, rumors of a Raiders return to Oakland intensified when a preseason game against the [[1988 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] was scheduled at Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 234.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1986, Davis sought to abandon the Coliseum in favor of a more modern stadium. In addition to sharing the venue with the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]], the Raiders were less than ecstatic with the Coliseum as it was aging and still lacked the luxury suites and other amenities that Davis was promised when he moved the Raiders to Los Angeles.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 230.</ref> Finally, the Coliseum had 95,000 seats and the Raiders were rarely able to fill all of them even in their best years, and so most Raiders home games were blacked out in Southern California. Numerous sites in California were considered, including one near now-defunct [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], where [[SoFi Stadium]] for the Rams and Chargers is under construction, and another in [[Carson, California|Carson]]. In August 1987 it was announced that the city of [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] paid Davis US$10&nbsp;million as a good-faith deposit for a prospective stadium site.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby''. p. 232.</ref> When the bid failed, Davis kept the non-refundable deposit.<ref name=\"deposit\">{{cite news |title=Al Davis may retire if Raiders win |url=http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102133117/http://bengals.enquirer.com/2003/01/23/wwwsbdavis.html |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"irwindale\">{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Plaschke |title=Shades of Gray |url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804232618/http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2003/writing/over250/over250.columns.third3-4.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> During this time Davis also almost moved the team to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] in a deal that would have included Davis becoming the managing partner of the [[Sacramento Kings]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/kings/sacramento-raiders-it-was-done-deal|title=Sacramento Raiders?

Both the Raiders and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] shared the San Francisco Bay Area market, on the West Coast of the United States. This meant that the Raiders could not play any home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Los Angeles Chargers]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they could not play interconference home games at the same time or network as the 49ers.

The [[Seattle Seahawks]] have an old rivalry with Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas as well, but the rivalry largely died down when the Seahawks moved to the [[NFC West]] as part of the NFL's 2002 realignment.\n\n===Divisional rivals===\n;Kansas City Chiefs\n{{Further|Chiefs\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The Raiders playing the Chiefs in the 1969 [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship game]]]]\nThe [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] are one of the Raiders' most iconic and longstanding divisional foes, with the rivalry dating back to earliest days of the AFL. Oakland lost the 1969 AFL Championship against Kansas City, who went on to beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and win the Super Bowl. From 1990 to 1999, the Raiders have lost 17 out of 20 regular season meetings between the Chiefs, including a 10\u2013game losing streak at Kansas City; the Raiders also lost to the Chiefs 10\u20136 in the Wild Card round on December 28, 1991. On September 8, 1996, the Chiefs also began to lead the overall series against the Raiders for the first time since November 23, 1969. On January 1, 2000, the last game of the 1999 NFL regular season, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs for the first time in Kansas City since 1988 in overtime on a 33-yard field goal kick made by Joe Nedney. The Chiefs lead the overall series '''64\u201353\u20132''', and are the only team in the AFC West that the Raiders have a losing record against. Oakland currently has defeated Kansas City just twice since the 2012 NFL season. Until October 19, 2017 - when they defeated the Chiefs, 31\u201330 on a game-tying touchdown on the last play of the game, leading to a game winning PAT - the Raiders had lost five straight to the Chiefs, their previous win against them being in the 2014 season.\n\n;Denver Broncos\n{{Further|Broncos\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 47 - Randy Gradishar.jpg|right|thumb|The Raiders playing against the Broncos in the [[1977-78 NFL playoffs|1977-78 AFC Championship Game]].]]\nThe Raiders' rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], is considered to be one of the most heated and well known rivalries in NFL history. The Raiders managed a 14-game winning streak against the Broncos from 1965 to 1971, which lasted until October 22, 1972, when the Broncos defeated the Raiders 30\u201323. While the Raiders still hold the advantage in the all-time series '''63\u201353\u20132''', the Broncos amassed 21 wins in 28 games, from the 1995 season and the arrival of Broncos head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], through the 2008 season. Shanahan coached the Raiders before being fired just four games into the 1989 season, which has only served to intensify this rivalry. On October 24, 2010, the Raiders beat the Broncos (59\u201314), giving the Raiders the most points scored in a game in the team's history. On December 13, 2015, the Raiders pulled a huge upset on the Broncos (15\u201312) by a spectacular performance from their defense allowing 4 field goals. Linebacker Khalil Mack who recorded 5 sacks in that game against Denver which is tied the most sacks in franchise along with Howie Long. The Broncos reached their first ever Super Bowl when they defeated the Raiders 20\u201317 in the AFC Championship Game. The two teams have faced off on Monday Night Football a total of 19 times, making it the most frequent Monday Night matchup in NFL history. \n\n;Los Angeles Chargers\n{{Further|Chargers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Los Angeles Chargers]]' rivalry with Oakland dates to the 1963 season, when the Raiders defeated the heavily favored Chargers twice, both come-from-behind fourth quarter victories. The Raiders held a streak without losing to the Chargers with a 16\u20130\u20132 record from 1968 to 1977. One of the most memorable games between these teams was the \"Holy Roller\" game in 1978, in which the Raiders fumbled for a touchdown in a very controversial play. In January 1981 the Chargers hosted their first AFC title against the Raiders. The Raiders were victorious over the Chargers of a score 34\u201327. The Raiders ended up moving on to play in Super Bowl 15 defeating the Eagles 27\u201310. On November 22, 1982, the Raiders hosted their first Monday Night football game in Los Angeles against the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers led the game in the 1st half 24\u20130 until the Raiders came into the 2nd half and made a huge comeback and defeated the San Diego Chargers 28\u201324. On October 10, 2010, the Raiders ended their 13-game losing streak to the San Diego Chargers with a score of 35\u201327. The Raiders hold the overall series advantage at '''63\u201354\u20132'''.\n\n===Historical rivals===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' rivalry with the Raiders has historically been very tight; as of the 2018 season the Raiders lead the regular season series 13 wins to 10, and their playoff rivalry is tied 3\u20133. The rivalry was extremely intense during the 1970s, and considered by many to be one of most vicious and brutal in the history of Professional football. From 1972 to 1976 the teams would meet in the playoffs five consecutive times, including three consecutive AFC Championship games. The rivalry really kicked off during the teams\u2019 first playoff meeting at the 1972 AFC divisional round in Pittsburgh. Considered to be one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the \"[[Immaculate Reception]]\", as it was dubbed, saw the Steelers beat the Raiders on a controversial last second play. During the 1975 AFC Championship game, Raiders strong safety [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] delivered a hit on Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]], which left him concussed. When the two teams met in the 1976 season opener, Atkinson again hit Swann, this time with a forearm to the head, causing yet another concussion. After the second incident, Steelers head coach [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Atkinson as part of the \"criminal element\" in the NFL. Atkinson filed a $2&nbsp;million [[defamation]] lawsuit against Noll and the Steelers, which he lost.<ref name=\"atkinson\">{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Smizik |title=Raiders of the lost rivalry |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108175110/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06302/733903-194.stm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 8, 2006 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> The rivalry reached its apex in the late 1980s, cooled when the teams faced each other only sporadically, then headed up again in the late 1990s before cooling again.\n\nThe four most recent contests between the Raiders and Steelers harkened back to the rivalry's history of bitterness and close competition. On December 6, 2009, the 3\u20138 Raiders helped spoil the [[Super Bowl XLIII|defending champions]]' quest for the playoffs as the game lead changed five times in the fourth quarter and a [[Louis Murphy]] touchdown with 11 seconds to go won it 27\u201324 for the Raiders. Oakland was then beaten 35\u20133 by Pittsburgh on November 21, 2010; this game brought out the roughness of the rivalry's 1970s history when Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was punched by Raiders defensive end [[Richard Seymour]] following a touchdown. On November 8, 2015, the Steelers outplayed the Raiders for a 38\u201335 victory. During the game, the Raiders defense allowed wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]] to catch 17 passes for 284 yards. Both are Steelers team records and the 284 yards is the 7th most yards receiving in a game in NFL history. However, in 2018, the Raiders upset the Steelers again, scoring a late touchdown to take a 24\u201321 fourth-quarter lead and getting the last laugh when Steelers kicker [[Chris Boswell]] slipped and missed a game-tying field goal. This game, which will likely be the teams' final matchup in Oakland, contributed to the Steelers' late-season collapse and missing the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset of Steelers, 24-21 |publisher=CBS San Francisco |work=The Associated Press |date=9 December 2018 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531012748/https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe rivalry between the Raiders and [[New England Patriots]] dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver [[Darryl Stingley]] was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety [[Jack Tatum]]. Before that, New England also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The [[Ben Dreith]] Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the team hosted New England in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by New England and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for [[Matt Millen]] attacking Patriots GM [[Patrick Sullivan (American football executive)|Patrick Sullivan]] with his helmet. The two teams met in a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|divisional-round]] playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"[[Tuck Rule Game]]\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and New England went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], the Raiders' former crosstown rivals in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"pats\">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Halley |title=Patriots-Raiders: No love lost over time |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-09-08-pats-raiders-history_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 8, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2007}}</ref> Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular season contests between the two teams.

Oakland defeated the Oilers in the 1980 Wild Card playoffs 27\u20137 and defeated the Titans in the 2002 AFC Championship Game 41\u201324.\n\n====Historic battle of the Bay rivalry====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[San Francisco 49ers]], located on the other side of [[San Francisco Bay]], were the Raiders' geographic rivals during the Raiders' time in Oakland. The first exhibition game, played in 1967, ended with the 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. As a result, games between the two are referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups happen only once every four years. Fans and players of the winning team could claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area.\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the preseason, the preseason game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]], including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL has decided to cancel all future preseason games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\nThe series ended on November 1, 2018, during a Thursday Night Football broadcast at Levi's Stadium, marking the last time both teams would meet before the Raiders moved to their new home in Las Vegas. The 49ers won the game 34-3 to tie their regular season series at 7.\n\n====Historic battle for Los Angeles rivalry====\nAs mentioned earlier, the Raiders and [[Los Angeles Rams]] had a rivalry during the 13 years both teams shared the Los Angeles market. The teams met six times in the regular season in this period; the Raiders won the first meeting of this era, 37\u201331, on December 18, 1982. The Raiders won four of their six games against the Rams while the teams shares the Los Angeles market.\n\n==Ownership, administration and financial operations==\n\n===Founding of the franchise===\nMax Winter, a Minneapolis businessman was among the eight proposed franchise owners in the American Football League. In a move typical of the NFL owners who were frightened by the prospect of competition and continually obstructed the new league, they offered Winter an expansion franchise in the NFL. This was after the NFL had rejected Lamar Hunt's feelers, saying they were not interested in expansion. One of many obfuscations put forward by the NFL in its attempt to derail the AFL.\n\nAfter the AFL's first draft, in which players were selected for the then nameless Minneapolis franchise, Winter reneged from his agreement with the AFL owners and defected to the NFL with a franchise that started play in 1961 and was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Vikings were never an AFL team, nor did they have any association with the AFL. Many of the players (including Abner Haynes) that had been assigned to the UNNAMED and defunct Minneapolis AFL franchise were signed by some of the seven loyal remaining members of the AFL's '[[Foolish Club]]'.\n\nThe city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. Once the consortium of owners was found for the eighth franchise, the team was named the Raiders.<ref name=\"hof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |title=Pro Football Hall of Fame \u2013 Oakland Raiders |accessdate=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230070530/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=23 |archive-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', p. 7.</ref> Because many of the defunct Minneapolis franchise's originally drafted players were signed by other AFL teams, the AFL held an 'allocation' draft, in which each team earmarked players that could be chosen by the Raiders.\n\nThe Minneapolis group did not take with them any of the rights to players they drafted when they defected to the NFL, because their first draft in that league was in 1961. The Raiders were not originally in Minnesota as some claim. They were a new, charter franchise in the [[American Football League]]. One reason they were so weak in the first few years of the AFL was that the other AFL teams did not make quality players available in the allocation draft.\n\nAt the time, Oakland seemed an unlikely venue for a professional football team. The city had not asked for a team, there was no ownership group and there was no stadium in Oakland suitable for pro football (the closest stadiums were in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and San Francisco) and there was already a successful NFL franchise in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] in the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. However, the AFL owners selected Oakland after [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner [[Barron Hilton]] threatened to forfeit his franchise unless a second team was placed on the West Coast.<ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving the franchise, Oakland civic leaders found a number of businesspeople willing to invest in the new team. A [[limited partnership]] was formed to own the team headed by managing general partner [[Chet Soda|Y. Charles (Chet) Soda]] (1908\u201389), a local real estate developer, and included general partners Ed McGah (1899\u20131983), Robert Osborne (1898\u20131968), [[F. Wayne Valley]] (1914\u201386), restaurateur Harvey Binns (1914\u201382), Don Blessing (1904\u20132000), and contractor Charles Harney (1902\u201362)<ref>Harney was the builder of San Francisco's Candlestick Park, built on a bleak parcel of land he owned; to date, the road leading to the stadium is known as Harney Way. With a push from Harney, the Raiders were allowed to play their final three 1960 home games at Candlestick.</ref> as well as numerous limited partners.\n\nThe [[1960 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] finished their first campaign with a 6\u20138 record, and lost $500,000. Desperately in need of money to continue running the team, Valley received a $400,000 loan from [[Buffalo Bills]] founder [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]]<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first season Soda dropped out of the partnership, and on January 17, 1961, Valley, McGah and Osborne bought out the remaining four general partners. Soon after, Valley and McGah purchased Osborne's interest, with Valley named as the managing general partner.\n\nIn 1962 Valley hired Al Davis, a former assistant coach for the San Diego Chargers, as head coach and general manager. In April 1966 Davis left the Raiders after being named AFL Commissioner. Two months later, the league announced its [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger with the NFL]]. With the merger, the position of commissioner was no longer needed, and Davis entered into discussions with Valley about returning to the Raiders. On July 25, 1966, Davis returned as part owner of the team. He purchased a 10% interest in the team for US$18,000, and became the team's third general partner \u2013 the partner in charge of football operations.<ref name=\"burke\"/><ref name=\"Dickey, Just Win, Baby, p. 41\"/>\n\nIn 1972, with Wayne Valley out of the country for several weeks attending the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Munich, Davis's attorneys drafted a revised partnership agreement that gave him total control over all of the Raiders' operations. McGah, a supporter of Davis, signed the agreement. Under partnership law, by a 2\u20131 vote of the general partners, the new agreement was thus ratified. Valley was furious when he discovered this, and immediately filed suit to have the new agreement overturned, but the court sided with Davis and McGah.\n\nIn 1976 Valley sold his interest in the team, and Davis \u2013 who now owned only 25% of the Raiders \u2013 was firmly in charge.<ref name=\"burke\" /><ref>Dickey, ''Just Win, Baby'', pp. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\n====Current ownership structure====\nLegally, the club is a limited partnership with nine partners \u2013 Davis' heirs and the heirs of the original eight team partners. From 1972 onward, Davis had exercised near-complete control as president of the team's general partner, A.D. Football, Inc. Although exact ownership stakes are not known, it has been reported that Davis owned 47% of the team shares before his death in 2011.<ref name=\"silence\">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Zeigler |title=Silence of elders tells on Raiders |url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/oct/31/silence-elders-tells-raiders/?chargers|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nEd McGah, the last of the original eight general partners of the Raiders, died in September 1983. Upon his death, his interest was devised to a family [[Trust law|trust]], of which his son, [[Eddie McGah|E.J. McGah]], was the [[trustee]]. The younger McGah was himself a part-owner of the team, as a limited partner, and died in 2002. Several members of the McGah family filed suit against Davis in October 2003, alleging mismanagement of the team by Davis. The lawsuit sought monetary damages and to remove Davis and A. D. Football, Inc. as the team's managing general partner. Among their specific complaints, the McGahs alleged that Davis failed to provide them with detailed financial information previously provided to Ed and E.J. McGah. The Raiders countered that\u2014under the terms of the partnership agreement as amended in 1972\u2014upon the death of the elder McGah in 1983, his general partner interest converted to that of a limited partner. The team continued to provide the financial information to the younger McGah as a courtesy, though it was under no obligation to do so.<ref name=\"lawsuit\">{{cite news|first=Paul T |last=Rosynsky |title=Raiders co-owner wants to boot Davis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20031015/ai_n14561183 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071013235455/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20031015/ai_n14561183 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]] |date=October 15, 2003 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe majority of the lawsuit was dismissed in April 2004, when an Alameda County Superior Court judge ruled that the case lacked merit since none of the other partners took part in the lawsuit.

The PSLs, which ranged in cost from $250 to $4,000, were meant to help repay the $200&nbsp;million it cost the city of Oakland and Alameda County to expand the Oakland Coliseum. They were only valid for ten years, however, while other teams issue them permanently. As a result, fewer than 31,000 PSLs were sold for a stadium that holds twice that number.
