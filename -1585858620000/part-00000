People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M.

In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H.

A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection.  [[Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]\n\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2\u201319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}</ref>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

D}}</ref>\n\nBaron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759\u2013762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}</ref> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\".

A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es.

In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments.<ref name=\"Reitan, 1964 45\u201351\" />\nSistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sistrunk|first=F|author2=McDavid, J.

They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.<ref name=\"Eagly1982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Wood | first2 = W. | year = 1982 | title = Inferred sex differences in status as a determinant of gender stereotypes about social influence | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 915\u2013928 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915}}</ref>  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.\n\n=== Size of the group ===\nAlthough conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P.

A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response.<ref name = Campbell1989 />\n\n=== Different stimuli ===\nIn 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France.<ref name=\"Milgram\" /> He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity.\n\n=== Neural correlates ===\nEvidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Izuma | first1 = K | year = 2013 | title = The neural basis of social influence and attitude change | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 456\u2013462 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.03.009 | pmid = 23608704 }}</ref> an area associated with memory and decision-making.

People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M.

In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H.

A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence.\n\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2\u201319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}</ref>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

D}}</ref>\n\nBaron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759\u2013762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}</ref> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\".

A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor [[:ja:\u9ad8\u91ce\u967d\u592a\u90ce|Yohtaro Takano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]], along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.<ref>Takano, Y., & Osaka, E.

First the [[Roman Curia]] in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar [[quintal]] of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397\u20131494|last=de Roover|first=Raymond|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=152\u2013154}}</ref> When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers.

Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by [[Marsilio Ficino]].\n\nLorenzo himself was an artist and wrote poetry in his native [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]. In his poetry, he celebrates life while acknowledging with melancholy the fragility and instability of the human condition, particularly in his later works. Love, feasts and light dominate his verse.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/La.Poesia.di.Lorenzo.dei.MediciLydiaUgolini.1985 La Poesie di [[Lorenzo di Medici]]] | ''The Poetry of [[Lorenzo di Medici]]''- [[Lydia Ugolini]]; Lecture (1985); Audio</ref>\n\nCosimo had started the collection of books that became the Medici Library (also called the [[Laurentian Library]]), and Lorenzo expanded it.

That success enabled Lorenzo to secure constitutional changes within the government of the Florentine Republic that further enhanced his own power.<ref name=ref2/>\n\nThereafter, Lorenzo, like his grandfather [[Cosimo de' Medici]], pursued a policy of maintaining peace, balancing power between the northern Italian states and keeping major European states such as France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] out of Italy.

Alum had been discovered by local citizens of [[Volterra]], who turned to Florence to get backing to exploit this important natural resource. A key commodity in the glass-making, tanning and textile industries, alum was available from only a few sources under the control of the Ottomans and monopolized by [[Genoa]] before the discovery of alum sources in Italy at [[Tolfa]]. First the [[Roman Curia]] in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar [[quintal]] of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, 1397\u20131494|last=de Roover|first=Raymond|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=152\u2013154}}</ref> When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers. Thus began an insurrection and secession from Florence, which involved putting to death several opposing citizens.

Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by [[Marsilio Ficino]].\n\nLorenzo himself was an artist and wrote poetry in his native [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]].
