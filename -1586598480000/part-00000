From the left : Dr. [[Thomas Heazle Parke]], [[Robert H. Nelson]], [[Henry M. Stanley]], [[William G. Stairs]], and [[Arthur J. M. Jephson]]]]\n{{Scramble for Africa}}\nThe '''Emin Pasha Relief Expedition''' of 1886 to 1889 was one of the last major European expeditions into the interior of [[Africa]] in the nineteenth century, ostensibly to the relief of [[Emin Pasha]], General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s besieged governor of [[Equatoria]], threatened by [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] forces. The expedition was led by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] and came to be both celebrated for its ambition in crossing \"darkest Africa\", and notorious for the deaths of so many of its members and the disease unwittingly left in its wake.\n\n==Anxiety about Equatoria==\n\nThe Mahdists [[Siege of Khartoum|captured Khartoum]] in 1885 and [[Egypt]]ian administration of the Sudan collapsed. The extreme southern province Equatoria was nearly cut off from the outside world, located as it was on the upper reaches of the [[Nile]] near [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. Emin Pasha was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] doctor and naturalist who had been appointed Governor of Equatoria. He was able to send and receive letters via [[Buganda]] and [[Zanzibar]] and had been informed in February 1886 that the Egyptian government would abandon Equatoria. In July, he was encouraged by missionary [[Alexander Murdoch Mackay|Alexander Mackay]] to invite the British government to annex Equatoria itself. The government was not interested in such a doubtful venture, but the British public came to see Emin as a second [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] in mortal danger from the Mahdists.\n\nScottish businessman and philanthropist [[Sir William Mackinnon, 1st Baronet|William Mackinnon]] had been involved in various colonial ventures, and by November he had approached Stanley about leading a relief expedition. Stanley declared himself ready \"at a moment's notice\" to go. Mackinnon then approached [[James Frederick Hutton|J. F. Hutton]], a business acquaintance also involved in colonial activities, and together they organized the \"Emin Pasha Relief Committee\", mostly consisting of Mackinnon's friends, whose first meeting was on 19 December 1886. The Committee raised a total of about \u00a332,000.\n\nStanley was officially still in the employment of [[Leopold II of Belgium]], by whom he had been employed in carving out Leopold's '[[Congo Free State]]'. As a compromise for letting Stanley go, it was arranged in a meeting in [[Brussels]] between Stanley and the king, that the expedition would take a longer route up the [[Congo River]], contrary to plans for a shorter route inland from the eastern African coast. In return, Leopold would provide his Free State steamers for the transportation of the expedition up the river, from Stanley Pool (now [[Pool Malebo]]) as far as the mouth of the [[Aruwimi River]].\n\nBy 1 January 1887, Stanley was back in [[London]] preparing the expedition to widespread public acclaim. Stanley himself was intent that the expedition be one of humanitarian assistance rather than of military conquest. He declared:\n\n{{Quote |text=The expedition is non-military\u2014that is to say, its purpose is not to fight, destroy, or waste; its purpose is to save, to relieve distress, to carry comfort. Emin Pasha may be a good man, a brave officer, a gallant fellow deserving of a strong effort of relief, but I decline to believe, and I have not been able to gather from any one in England an impression, that his life, or the lives of the few hundreds under him, would overbalance the lives of thousands of natives, and the devastation of immense tracts of country which an expedition strictly military would naturally cause. The expedition is a mere powerful caravan, armed with rifles for the purpose of insuring the safe conduct of the ammunition to Emin Pasha, and for the more certain protection of his people during the retreat home. But it also has means of purchasing the friendship of tribes and chiefs, of buying food and paying its way liberally. |character=Henry Morton Stanley |author=Joel Headley |title=''Stanley's Adventures in the Wilds of Africa''<ref>{{cite book|last=Headley|first=Joel|title=Stanley's Adventures in the Wilds of Africa|year=1890|publisher=Edgewood|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38389/38389-h/38389-h.htm}}</ref> }}\n\n== Double purpose of expedition ==\nIn a number of publications made after the expedition, Stanley asserts that the purpose of the effort was singular; to offer relief to Emin Pasha. For example, he writes the following while explaining the final route decision.\n\n{{Quote |text=The advantages of the Congo route were about five hundred miles shorter land journey, and less opportunities for deserting. It also quieted the fears of the French and Germans that, behind this professedly humanitarian quest, we might have annexation projects.|author=Henry Morton Stanley |title=''The Autobiography of Sir Henry Morton Stanley''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Sir Henry Morton Stanley|last=Stanley|first=Henry|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=1909|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=355}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Stanley's other writings point to a secondary goal which was precisely territorial annexation. He writes in his book on the expedition, about his meeting with the Sultan of Zanzibar, when he arrived there at the start of the expedition, and a certain matter that was discussed at that meeting. At first, he is not explicit on the agenda but it is clear enough.\n\n{{Quote |text=We then entered heartily into our business; how absolutely necessary it was that he should promptly enter into an agreement with the English within the limits assigned by Anglo-German treaty. It would take too long to describe the details of the conversation, but I obtained from him the answer needed.|author=Henry Morton Stanley |title=''In Darkest Africa''<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Darkest Africa|last=Stanley|first=Henry|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1891|isbn=|location=New York|pages=62}}</ref>}}\n\nA few pages further in the same book, Stanley explains what the matter was about and this time, he makes it clear that indeed, it had to do with annexation.\n\n{{Quote |text=I have settled several little commissions at Zanzibar satisfactorily. One was to get the Sultan to sign the concessions which Mackinnon tried to obtain a long time ago. As the Germans have magnificent territory east of Zanzibar, it was but fair that England should have some portion for the protection she has accorded to Zanzibar since 1841 ... The concession that we wished to obtain embraced a portion of East African coast, of which Mombasa and Melindi were the principal towns. For eight years, to my knowledge, the matter had been placed before His Highness, but the Sultan's signature was difficult to obtain.|author=Henry Morton Stanley |title=''In Darkest Africa''<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Darkest Africa|last=Stanley|first=Henry|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1891|isbn=|location=New York|pages=69|via=}}</ref>}}\n\nThe records at the National Archives at Kew, London, offer an even deeper insight and show that annexation was a purpose he had been aware of for the expedition. This is because there are a number of treaties curated there (and gathered by Stanley himself from what is present day Uganda during the Emin Pasha Expedition), ostensibly gaining British protection for a number of African chiefs. Amongst these were a number that have long been identified as possible frauds.<ref>J. M. Gray, \"Early Treaties in Uganda, 1888-1891\", ''The Uganda Journal, The Journal of the Uganda Society'', 2:1 (1948), 30</ref> A good example is treaty number 56, supposedly agreed upon between Stanley and the people of \"Mazamboni, Katto, and Kalenge\". These people had signed over to Stanley \"the Sovereign Right and Right of Government over our country for ever in consideration of value received and for the protection he has accorded us and our Neighbours against KabbaRega and his Warasura\".<ref>British National Archives, Kew (BNA) FO 2/139 (Treaty number 56, undated).</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:In Darkest Africa the Advance.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The steel boat ''Advance'' as depicted in ''In Darkest Africa'' by H.M. Stanley.]]\nThe plan of the expedition was to go to [[Cairo]], then to Zanzibar to hire [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], then south of Africa, around the Cape to the mouth of the Congo, up the Congo by Leopold's [[Steamboat|steamers]], branching off at the [[Aruwimi River]]. Stanley intended to establish a camp on the Aruwimi, then go east overland through unknown territory to reach Lake Albert and Equatoria. He then expected that Emin would send the families of Emin's Egyptian employees back along the just-pioneered route, along with a large store of [[ivory]] accumulated in Equatoria, while Stanley, Emin, and Emin's soldiers would proceed eastward to Zanzibar. Coincidentally, public doubts over the plan centered around whether it could be achieved; the possibility that Emin might not want to leave seems not to have been considered.\n\nThe expedition was the largest and best-equipped to go to Africa; a 28-foot steel boat named the ''Advance'' was designed to be divided into 12 sections for carrying over land, and [[Hiram Maxim]] presented the expedition with one of his recently invented [[Maxim gun]]s, which was the first to be brought to Africa. Merely 'exhibiting' the gun was thought to be a scare, which would spare the expedition problems with troublesome natives.\n\nThe Relief Committee received 400 applications by hopeful participants. From these, Stanley chose the officers who were to accompany him to Africa:\n* [[James S. Jameson]], [[John Rose Troup]], and [[Herbert Ward (sculptor)|Herbert Ward]] had all travelled in Africa before, Jameson as a big game hunter, artist, and traveller, Troup and Ward as employees of the Congo Free State.\n* [[Robert H. Nelson]], [[William Bonny]], [[William G. Stairs]], and [[Edmund Barttelot]] were all military men. Barttelot had been doing service in India.\n* [[A. J. Mounteney-Jephson]] was a young 'gentleman of leisure' coming from the merchant marine who was hired on the quality of his face only, but he paid \u00a31,000 to the Relief Committee, as did Jameson, in order to participate in the expedition.\n* The expedition's doctor [[Thomas Heazle Parke]] was hired in Alexandria where he did military service, as a last-minute disposition, while the expedition was underway to Zanzibar. <!---not clear what this sentence means--->\n* [[William Hoffmann]] was Stanley's personal servant, curiously enough scarcely mentioned at all in Stanley's own account of the events.\n\nStanley departed London on 21 January 1887 and arrived in Cairo on 27 January.  Egyptian objections to the Congo route were overridden by a telegram from [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and the expedition was permitted to march under the Egyptian flag. Stanley also met with [[Mason Bey]], [[Georg August Schweinfurth|Schweinfurth]], and [[Wilhelm Junker|Junker]], who had more up-to-date information about Equatoria.\n\nStanley left Cairo on 3 February, joined up with expedition members during stops in [[Suez]] and [[Aden]], and arrived in Zanzibar on 22 February.  The next three days were spent packing for the expedition, loading the ''[[Madura]]'', and negotiating. Stanley acted as a representative of Mackinnon in convincing the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] to grant a concession for what later became the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (I.B.E.A.C.), and made two agreements with [[Tippu Tib]]. The first included appointing him as Governor of [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], an arrangement much criticized in Europe as a deal with a slave-trader, and the second agreement regarded the provisions of carriers for the expedition. In addition to transporting stores, the carriers were now also expected to bring out some 75 tons of ivory stored in Equatoria. Stanley posted letters to Emin predicting his arrival on Lake Albert around August.\n\n==Up the Congo==\n[[Image:Emin pasha relief expedition map 1890.png|thumb|{{largethumb}}|The expedition route between the Upper Congo river and Bagamoyo]]\n\nThe expedition left Zanzibar on 25 February and arrived at [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Banana]] at the mouth of the Congo on 18 March. Their arrival was somewhat unexpected, because a telegraph cable had broken and local officials had received no instructions. Chartered steamers brought the expedition to [[Matadi]], where the carriers took over, bringing some 800 loads of stores and ammunition to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] on the Stanley Pool. Progress was slow, since the [[rainy season]] was at its height, and food was short - a problem that was to be persistent throughout the expedition (the area along the route rarely had spare food for 1,000 hardworking men, as it was a [[subsistence economy]]).\n[[Image:Peace congoship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Le Peace'']]\n[[Image:Florida01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Le Florida'']]\nOn 21 April, the expedition arrived at Leopoldville. King Leopold had promised a flotilla of river steamers, but only one  worked: the ''Stanley''. Stanley requisitioned two (''Peace'' and ''Henry Reed'') from missionaries of the [[BMS World Mission|Baptist Mission]] and the [[Livingstone Inland Mission]], whose protests were overridden, as well as the ''Florida'', which was still under construction and so used as a barge.  Even these were insufficient, so many of the stores were left at Leopoldville and more at [[Bolobo]].  At this point, Stanley also announced the division of the expedition: a \"Rear Column\" would encamp at [[Yambuya]] on the Aruwimi, while the \"Advance Column\" pressed on to Equatoria.\n\nThe voyage up the Congo started 1 May and was generally uneventful. At [[Bangala Station]], Barttelot and Tippu Tib continued up to Stanley Falls in the ''Henry Reed'', while Stanley took the Aruwimi to Yambuya. The inhabitants of Yambuya refused permission to reside in their village, so Stanley attacked and drove the villagers away, turning the deserted village into a fortified camp. Meanwhile, at Stanley Falls, Tippu Tib attempted to acquire carriers, but he believed that Stanley had broken his part of their agreement by leaving ammunition behind, and Barttelot came to Yambuya with only an indefinite promise that carriers would arrive in several weeks.\n\n==Darkest Africa==\n\nStanley, however, insisted on speed, and left for Lake Albert on 28 June, originally expecting to take two months. The Advance Column, however, was unprepared for the extreme difficulties of travel through the [[Ituri forest]] and did not reach the lake until December. Only 169 of the 389 who set out from Yambuya were still alive. The trees of the forest were so tall and dense that little light reached the floor (thus the phrase \"darkest Africa\"), food was scarcely to be found, and the local [[Pygmies]] took the expedition for an Arab raiding party, shooting at them with poisoned arrows. The expedition stopped at two Arab settlements, [[Ugarrowwa's]] and [[Ipoto]], in each case leaving more of their equipment behind in exchange for food.\n\nThe forest eventually gave way to grassland, and on 13 December the expedition was looking down on Lake Albert. However, Emin was not there, and the locals had not seen a European in many years. Stanley decided to return to the village of [[Ibwiri]] on the plateau above the lake, where they built [[Fort Bodo]]. Stairs went back to Ipoto to collect men and equipment, and returned 12 February. A second trip went back to Ugarrowwa's to collect more equipment. Meanwhile, on 2 April Stanley returned to Lake Albert, this time with the ''Advance''. On 18 April they received a letter from Emin, who had heard about the expedition a year earlier, and had come down the lake in March after hearing rumors of Stanley's arrival.\n\n==With Emin==\n\nJephson was sent on ahead to the lake with the ''Advance'', took the boat up to [[Mswa]], and met Emin on 27 April 1888. Emin brought his steamer to the south end of the lake, and there met Stanley on the 29th, who was surprised to find the figure of Emin to have \"not a trace on it of ill-health or anxiety\", and celebrated with three bottles of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] that had been carried all the way up the Congo. Emin provided Stanley with food and other supplies, thus rescuing the rescuers.\n\nAt this point things became difficult.  Emin was primarily interested in ammunition and other supplies, and a communications route, all of which would assist him in remaining in Equatoria, while Stanley's main goal was to bring Emin out. A month of discussion produced no agreement, and on 24 May Stanley went back to Fort Bodo, arriving there 8 June and meeting Stairs, who had returned from Ugarrowwa's with just fourteen surviving men. On the way Stanley saw the [[Ruwenzori Mountains]] for the first time (although Parke and Jephson had seen them on 20 April).\n\n==Fate of the Rear Column==\n\nOn 16 June, Stanley left the fort in search of the Rear Column; no word of them or from them had been received in a long time. Finally, on 17 August at [[Banalya]], 90 miles upstream from Yambuya, Stanley found Bonny the sole European left in charge of the Column, along with a handful of starving carriers. Barttelot had been shot in a dispute, Jameson was at Bangala dying of a fever, Troup had been invalided home, and [[Herbert Ward (sculptor)|Herbert Ward]] had gone back down the Congo a second time to telegraph the Relief Committee in London for further instructions (the Column had not heard from Stanley in over a year). The original purpose of the Rear Column \u2013 to wait for the additional carriers from Tippu Tib \u2013 had not been accomplished, since without the ammunition supplied by the expedition, Tippu Tib had nothing with which to recruit. After several side trips, Barttelot decided to send Troup and others on the sick list down the Congo, and 11 June 1888, after the arrival of a group of [[Manyema]] bringing Barttelot's total to 560, set off in search of Stanley.\n\nBut the march soon disintegrated into chaos, with large-scale desertion and multiple trips to try to bring up stores; then on 19 July Barttelot was shot while trying to interfere with a Manyema festival. Jameson decided to go down to Bangala to bring up extra loads and left on 9 August, shortly before Stanley's arrival. Stanley was incensed at the state of the Rear Column, blaming them for lack of motion despite his previous orders that they wait for him at Yambuya. From surviving officers Stanley also heard stories of Barttelot's brutality and of another officer, Jameson, who was alleged to have purchased a young female slave and given her to cannibals so he could record her being killed and eaten.<ref>Jeal, T, ''Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer'', Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 357-358.</ref> After the dispatch of a number of letters down-Congo, the expedition returned to Fort Bodo, taking a different route that proved no better for food supply, and it reached the Fort on 20 December, now reduced to 412 men, of whom 124 were too ill to carry any loads.\n\nOn 16 January 1889, near Lake Albert, Stanley received letters from Emin and Jephson, who had been made prisoner by Emin's officers for several months, while at the same time the Mahdists had been capturing additional stations of Equatoria. Since Stanley's arrival, numerous rumors had gone around about Emin's intentions and the likely fate of the soldiers, and in August of the previous year matters had come to a head; a number of officers rebelled, deposed Emin as governor, and kept him and Jephson under a sort of house arrest in [[Dufile]] until November. Even so, Emin was still reluctant to abandon the province.\n\n==To the coast==\nBy 17 February all the surviving members of the expedition, and Emin with a group of about 65 loyal soldiers, met at Stanley's camp above Lake Albert, and during the subsequent weeks several hundred more of Emin's followers, many of them the families of the soldiers, accumulated there. Emin still had not expressed a firm intention to leave Equatoria, and 5 April, after a heated argument, Stanley determined to leave shortly, and the expedition departed Kavalli's for the coast on 10 April.\n\nThe trip to the coast passed first south, along the western flank of the [[Rwenzori Mountains|Ruwenzoris]], and Stairs attempted to ascend to a summit, reaching 10,677&nbsp;ft before having to turn around. They then passed by [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]], then across to the southernmost point of [[Lake Victoria]], passing through the kingdoms of [[Ankole]] and [[Karagwe]]. Stanley made \"treaties\" with the various rulers; although it is most likely that these were not regarded as such by the locals, they were later used to establish I.B.E.A claims in the area.\n\nLake Victoria was seen on 15 August, and the expedition reached Mackay's missionary station at [[Usambiro]] on 28 August. At this point they began to learn of the complicated changing situation in East Africa, with British and German interests scrambling to stake their claims, and a second relief expedition under [[Frederick John Jackson]]. After waiting fruitlessly for news of the Jackson expedition, Stanley left on 17 September, with a party now reduced to some 700 by a combination of death and desertion.\n\nAs the expedition approached the coast, they encountered parties of Germans and other signs of German activity in the interior, and were met by commissioner [[Hermann Wissmann|Wissmann]] on 4 December and escorted into [[Bagamoyo]]. That evening a banquet was held, during which an inebriated Emin fell out of a 2nd-story window he mistook for a balcony, and from which he did not recover until the end of January 1890. In the meantime, the rest of the expedition had dispersed; Stanley went to Zanzibar and then to Cairo, where he wrote the 900 pages of ''In Darkest Africa'' in just 50 days.  The Zanzibari carriers were paid off or (in the case of prisoners) returned to their masters, the Sudanese and Egyptians were transported back to Egypt, some later returning to work for the I.B.E.A. Emin took service with the Germans in February, and the other Europeans returned to England.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nStanley returned to Europe in May 1890 to tremendous public acclaim; both he and his officers received numerous awards, honorary degrees, and speaking engagements. In June his just-published book sold 150,000 copies alone. But the adulation was to be short-lived. By autumn, as the true cost of the expedition became known, and as the families of Barttelot and Jameson reacted to Stanley's accusations of incompetence in the Rear Column, criticism and condemnation became widespread. In the end, it came to be the last expedition of its type; future African expeditions would be government-run in pursuit of military or political goals, or conducted purely for science.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1900, a devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic spread into territories that are now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], western [[Uganda]] and south of [[Sudan]]. Native cattle traveling with the expedition may have introduced the parasite into previously-unaffected regions.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/brain/awn069| pages = awn069| last = Parry| first = Eldryd H.

One was to get the Sultan to sign the concessions which Mackinnon tried to obtain a long time ago. As the Germans have magnificent territory east of Zanzibar, it was but fair that England should have some portion for the protection she has accorded to Zanzibar since 1841 ... The concession that we wished to obtain embraced a portion of East African coast, of which Mombasa and Melindi were the principal towns. For eight years, to my knowledge, the matter had been placed before His Highness, but the Sultan's signature was difficult to obtain.|author=Henry Morton Stanley |title=''In Darkest Africa''<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Darkest Africa|last=Stanley|first=Henry|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1891|isbn=|location=New York|pages=69|via=}}</ref>}}\n\nThe records at the National Archives at Kew, London, offer an even deeper insight and show that annexation was a purpose he had been aware of for the expedition. This is because there are a number of treaties curated there (and gathered by Stanley himself from what is present day Uganda during the Emin Pasha Expedition), ostensibly gaining British protection for a number of African chiefs. Amongst these were a number that have long been identified as possible frauds.<ref>J. M. Gray, \"Early Treaties in Uganda, 1888-1891\", ''The Uganda Journal, The Journal of the Uganda Society'', 2:1 (1948), 30</ref> A good example is treaty number 56, supposedly agreed upon between Stanley and the people of \"Mazamboni, Katto, and Kalenge\". These people had signed over to Stanley \"the Sovereign Right and Right of Government over our country for ever in consideration of value received and for the protection he has accorded us and our Neighbours against KabbaRega and his Warasura\".<ref>British National Archives, Kew (BNA) FO 2/139 (Treaty number 56, undated).</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:In Darkest Africa the Advance.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The steel boat ''Advance'' as depicted in ''In Darkest Africa'' by H.M. Stanley.]]\nThe plan of the expedition was to go to [[Cairo]], then to Zanzibar to hire [[Porter (carrier)|porter]]s, then south of Africa, around the Cape to the mouth of the Congo, up the Congo by Leopold's [[Steamboat|steamers]], branching off at the [[Aruwimi River]]. Stanley intended to establish a camp on the Aruwimi, then go east overland through unknown territory to reach Lake Albert and Equatoria. He then expected that Emin would send the families of Emin's Egyptian employees back along the just-pioneered route, along with a large store of [[ivory]] accumulated in Equatoria, while Stanley, Emin, and Emin's soldiers would proceed eastward to Zanzibar. Coincidentally, public doubts over the plan centered around whether it could be achieved; the possibility that Emin might not want to leave seems not to have been considered.\n\nThe expedition was the largest and best-equipped to go to Africa; a 28-foot steel boat named the ''Advance'' was designed to be divided into 12 sections for carrying over land, and [[Hiram Maxim]] presented the expedition with one of his recently invented [[Maxim gun]]s, which was the first to be brought to Africa. Merely 'exhibiting' the gun was thought to be a scare, which would spare the expedition problems with troublesome natives.\n\nThe Relief Committee received 400 applications by hopeful participants. From these, Stanley chose the officers who were to accompany him to Africa:\n\n*[[James S. Jameson]], [[John Rose Troup]], and [[Herbert Ward (sculptor)|Herbert Ward]] had all travelled in Africa before, Jameson as a big game hunter, artist, and traveller, Troup and Ward as employees of the Congo Free State. \n*[[Robert H. Nelson]], [[William Bonny]], [[William G. Stairs]], and [[Edmund Barttelot]] were all military men. Barttelot had been doing service in India. \n*[[A. J. Mounteney-Jephson]] was a young 'gentleman of leisure' coming from the merchant marine who was hired on the quality of his face only, but he paid \u00a31,000 to the Relief Committee, as did Jameson, in order to participate in the expedition.\n*The expedition's doctor [[Thomas Heazle Parke]] was hired in Alexandria where he did military service, as a last-minute disposition, while the expedition was underway to Zanzibar. <!---not clear what this sentence means--->\n*[[William Hoffmann]] was Stanley's personal servant, curiously enough scarcely mentioned at all in Stanley's own account of the events.\n\nStanley departed London on 21 January 1887 and arrived in Cairo on 27 January.  Egyptian objections to the Congo route were overridden by a telegram from [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and the expedition was permitted to march under the Egyptian flag. Stanley also met with [[Mason Bey]], [[Georg August Schweinfurth|Schweinfurth]], and [[Wilhelm Junker|Junker]], who had more up-to-date information about Equatoria.\n\nStanley left Cairo on 3 February, joined up with expedition members during stops in [[Suez]] and [[Aden]], and arrived in Zanzibar on 22 February.  The next three days were spent packing for the expedition, loading the ''[[Madura]]'', and negotiating. Stanley acted as a representative of Mackinnon in convincing the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] to grant a concession for what later became the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (I.B.E.A.C.), and made two agreements with [[Tippu Tib]]. The first included appointing him as Governor of [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], an arrangement much criticized in Europe as a deal with a slave-trader, and the second agreement regarded the provisions of carriers for the expedition. In addition to transporting stores, the carriers were now also expected to bring out some 75 tons of ivory stored in Equatoria. Stanley posted letters to Emin predicting his arrival on Lake Albert around August.\n\n==Up the Congo==\n[[Image:Emin pasha relief expedition map 1890.png|thumb|{{largethumb}}|The expedition route between the Upper Congo river and Bagamoyo]]\n\nThe expedition left Zanzibar on 25 February and arrived at [[Banana, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Banana]] at the mouth of the Congo on 18 March. Their arrival was somewhat unexpected, because a telegraph cable had broken and local officials had received no instructions. Chartered steamers brought the expedition to [[Matadi]], where the carriers took over, bringing some 800 loads of stores and ammunition to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] on the Stanley Pool. Progress was slow, since the [[rainy season]] was at its height, and food was short - a problem that was to be persistent throughout the expedition (the area along the route rarely had spare food for 1,000 hardworking men, as it was a [[subsistence economy]]).\n[[Image:Peace congoship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Le Peace'']]\n[[Image:Florida01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Le Florida'']]\nOn 21 April, the expedition arrived at Leopoldville. King Leopold had promised a flotilla of river steamers, but only one  worked: the ''Stanley''. Stanley requisitioned two (''Peace'' and ''Henry Reed'') from missionaries of the [[BMS World Mission|Baptist Mission]] and the [[Livingstone Inland Mission]], whose protests were overridden, as well as the ''Florida'', which was still under construction and so used as a barge.  Even these were insufficient, so many of the stores were left at Leopoldville and more at [[Bolobo]].  At this point, Stanley also announced the division of the expedition: a \"Rear Column\" would encamp at [[Yambuya]] on the Aruwimi, while the \"Advance Column\" pressed on to Equatoria.\n\nThe voyage up the Congo started 1 May and was generally uneventful. At [[Bangala Station]], Barttelot and Tippu Tib continued up to Stanley Falls in the ''Henry Reed'', while Stanley took the Aruwimi to Yambuya. The inhabitants of Yambuya refused permission to reside in their village, so Stanley attacked and drove the villagers away, turning the deserted village into a fortified camp. Meanwhile, at Stanley Falls, Tippu Tib attempted to acquire carriers, but he believed that Stanley had broken his part of their agreement by leaving ammunition behind, and Barttelot came to Yambuya with only an indefinite promise that carriers would arrive in several weeks.\n\n==Darkest Africa==\n\nStanley, however, insisted on speed, and left for Lake Albert on 28 June, originally expecting to take two months. The Advance Column, however, was unprepared for the extreme difficulties of travel through the [[Ituri forest]] and did not reach the lake until December. Only 169 of the 389 who set out from Yambuya were still alive. The trees of the forest were so tall and dense that little light reached the floor (thus the phrase \"darkest Africa\"), food was scarcely to be found, and the local [[Pygmies]] took the expedition for an Arab raiding party, shooting at them with poisoned arrows. The expedition stopped at two Arab settlements, [[Ugarrowwa's]] and [[Ipoto]], in each case leaving more of their equipment behind in exchange for food.\n\nThe forest eventually gave way to grassland, and on 13 December the expedition was looking down on Lake Albert. However, Emin was not there, and the locals had not seen a European in many years. Stanley decided to return to the village of [[Ibwiri]] on the plateau above the lake, where they built [[Fort Bodo]]. Stairs went back to Ipoto to collect men and equipment, and returned 12 February. A second trip went back to Ugarrowwa's to collect more equipment. Meanwhile, on 2 April Stanley returned to Lake Albert, this time with the ''Advance''. On 18 April they received a letter from Emin, who had heard about the expedition a year earlier, and had come down the lake in March after hearing rumors of Stanley's arrival.\n\n==With Emin==\n\nJephson was sent on ahead to the lake with the ''Advance'', took the boat up to [[Mswa]], and met Emin on 27 April 1888. Emin brought his steamer to the south end of the lake, and there met Stanley on the 29th, who was surprised to find the figure of Emin to have \"not a trace on it of ill-health or anxiety\", and celebrated with three bottles of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] that had been carried all the way up the Congo. Emin provided Stanley with food and other supplies, thus rescuing the rescuers.\n\nAt this point things became difficult.  Emin was primarily interested in ammunition and other supplies, and a communications route, all of which would assist him in remaining in Equatoria, while Stanley's main goal was to bring Emin out. A month of discussion produced no agreement, and on 24 May Stanley went back to Fort Bodo, arriving there 8 June and meeting Stairs, who had returned from Ugarrowwa's with just fourteen surviving men. On the way Stanley saw the [[Ruwenzori Mountains]] for the first time (although Parke and Jephson had seen them on 20 April).\n\n==Fate of the Rear Column==\n\nOn 16 June, Stanley left the fort in search of the Rear Column; no word of them or from them had been received in a long time. Finally, on 17 August at [[Banalya]], 90 miles upstream from Yambuya, Stanley found Bonny the sole European left in charge of the Column, along with a handful of starving carriers. Barttelot had been shot in a dispute, Jameson was at Bangala dying of a fever, Troup had been invalided home, and [[Herbert Ward (sculptor)|Herbert Ward]] had gone back down the Congo a second time to telegraph the Relief Committee in London for further instructions (the Column had not heard from Stanley in over a year). The original purpose of the Rear Column \u2013 to wait for the additional carriers from Tippu Tib \u2013 had not been accomplished, since without the ammunition supplied by the expedition, Tippu Tib had nothing with which to recruit. After several side trips, Barttelot decided to send Troup and others on the sick list down the Congo, and 11 June 1888, after the arrival of a group of [[Manyema]] bringing Barttelot's total to 560, set off in search of Stanley.\n\nBut the march soon disintegrated into chaos, with large-scale desertion and multiple trips to try to bring up stores; then on 19 July Barttelot was shot while trying to interfere with a Manyema festival. Jameson decided to go down to Bangala to bring up extra loads and left on 9 August, shortly before Stanley's arrival. Stanley was incensed at the state of the Rear Column, blaming them for lack of motion despite his previous orders that they wait for him at Yambuya. From surviving officers Stanley also heard stories of Barttelot's brutality and of another officer, Jameson, who was alleged to have purchased a young female slave and given her to cannibals so he could record her being killed and eaten.<ref>Jeal, T, ''Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer'', Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 357-358.</ref> After the dispatch of a number of letters down-Congo, the expedition returned to Fort Bodo, taking a different route that proved no better for food supply, and it reached the Fort on 20 December, now reduced to 412 men, of whom 124 were too ill to carry any loads.\n\nOn 16 January 1889, near Lake Albert, Stanley received letters from Emin and Jephson, who had been made prisoner by Emin's officers for several months, while at the same time the Mahdists had been capturing additional stations of Equatoria. Since Stanley's arrival, numerous rumors had gone around about Emin's intentions and the likely fate of the soldiers, and in August of the previous year matters had come to a head; a number of officers rebelled, deposed Emin as governor, and kept him and Jephson under a sort of house arrest in [[Dufile]] until November. Even so, Emin was still reluctant to abandon the province.\n\n==To the coast==\nBy 17 February all the surviving members of the expedition, and Emin with a group of about 65 loyal soldiers, met at Stanley's camp above Lake Albert, and during the subsequent weeks several hundred more of Emin's followers, many of them the families of the soldiers, accumulated there. Emin still had not expressed a firm intention to leave Equatoria, and 5 April, after a heated argument, Stanley determined to leave shortly, and the expedition departed Kavalli's for the coast on 10 April.\n\nThe trip to the coast passed first south, along the western flank of the [[Rwenzori Mountains|Ruwenzoris]], and Stairs attempted to ascend to a summit, reaching 10,677&nbsp;ft before having to turn around. They then passed by [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]], then across to the southernmost point of [[Lake Victoria]], passing through the kingdoms of [[Ankole]] and [[Karagwe]]. Stanley made \"treaties\" with the various rulers; although it is most likely that these were not regarded as such by the locals, they were later used to establish I.B.E.A claims in the area.\n\nLake Victoria was seen on 15 August, and the expedition reached Mackay's missionary station at [[Usambiro]] on 28 August. At this point they began to learn of the complicated changing situation in East Africa, with British and German interests scrambling to stake their claims, and a second relief expedition under [[Frederick John Jackson]]. After waiting fruitlessly for news of the Jackson expedition, Stanley left on 17 September, with a party now reduced to some 700 by a combination of death and desertion.\n\nAs the expedition approached the coast, they encountered parties of Germans and other signs of German activity in the interior, and were met by commissioner [[Hermann Wissmann|Wissmann]] on 4 December and escorted into [[Bagamoyo]]. That evening a banquet was held, during which an inebriated Emin fell out of a 2nd-story window he mistook for a balcony, and from which he did not recover until the end of January 1890. In the meantime, the rest of the expedition had dispersed; Stanley went to Zanzibar and then to Cairo, where he wrote the 900 pages of ''In Darkest Africa'' in just 50 days.  The Zanzibari carriers were paid off or (in the case of prisoners) returned to their masters, the Sudanese and Egyptians were transported back to Egypt, some later returning to work for the I.B.E.A. Emin took service with the Germans in February, and the other Europeans returned to England.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nStanley returned to Europe in May 1890 to tremendous public acclaim; both he and his officers received numerous awards, honorary degrees, and speaking engagements. In June his just-published book sold 150,000 copies alone. But the adulation was to be short-lived. By autumn, as the true cost of the expedition became known, and as the families of Barttelot and Jameson reacted to Stanley's accusations of incompetence in the Rear Column, criticism and condemnation became widespread. In the end, it came to be the last expedition of its type; future African expeditions would be government-run in pursuit of military or political goals, or conducted purely for science.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1900, a devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic spread into territories that are now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], western [[Uganda]] and south of [[Sudan]]. Native cattle traveling with the expedition may have introduced the parasite into previously-unaffected regions.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/brain/awn069| pages = awn069| last = Parry| first = Eldryd H.

The CIA used the line of communication with Thondup to cultivate a credible source of intelligence on the ground and administer possible operations moving forward. Thondup described mounting Tibetan hostility toward the occupying Chinese Communist forces and the recent armed conflict in Lhasa between Tibetan demonstrators and Chinese Communist military police. From the intelligence, the CIA learned of the 10,000-15,000 Chinese troops stationed in Tibet. A dire food shortage also exacerbated tensions as Tibetans found it increasingly difficult provide food for the people. Furthermore, the communication with Thondup revealed the workings of covert actions from Tibetans who refused to follow the Dalai Lama\u2019s acceptance of Chinese Communist occupation. The CIA and the State Department both expressed optimism with the circumstances in Tibet and Lhasa, believing that they could maneuver accordingly.<ref>Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952\u20131954, China and Japan, Volume XIV, PART 1 611.93B/5\u20131452 No. 26 Memorandum by the Acting Director of the Office of Chinese Affairs (Perkins) to the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs (Allison) May 14, 1952.</ref>\n\nIn September 1952, a CIA intelligence report noted the difficulty in continuing to support the Tibetan resistance when the Chinese Communist government and the massive People's Liberation Army (PLA) fully occupied the country. As a result of this Chinese domination over the Tibetans, direct diplomatic relations between Tibet and India ceased. A daily Hindi newspaper reported that this move had ended 16 years of direct contact between the governments of India and Tibet. India was able to have direct communications until that point because China's authority in Tibet was still limited. In the final paragraph of the article, the newspaper writes, \"The Chinese occupation of Tibet a year ago has changed this relationship. The cause was inevitable, and India had no choice but to accept this arrangement because the Chinese Communists now have complete control of the foreign affairs of Tibet\". Previously, India had provided a link for United States' support to the Tibetan resistance.<ref name=\"cia.gov\" /> Later that year (December 1952), the CIA produced an Information Report (Classification: Secret) containing two items in the subject line: 1) Anti-Communist Activities, Tibet, and 2) Chinese Communist Activities, Tibet. The document shows that the agency was closely scrutinizing both Tibetan and Chinese groups and individuals at the time, as well as any other obtained intelligence. The report defines the anti-Communist Tibetan People's Party and identified geographic areas where the Party's support was strongest. A 36-year old leader, Lhopto Rimpochhe was named as the leader of the \"warrior monks.\" The document goes on to report on intelligence regarding a petition sent to the Chinese authorities in Lhasa by Ragashar Shape, Tibetan Defense Minister,<ref>{{Cite book |title = Tibet: An Unfinished Story |last=Halper |first=Lezlee Brown and Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn = 978-0-19-936836-5 |location=New York, New York |page = 119 |quote= }}</ref> that went ignored. The Shape petition included the following points: the Dalai Lama should continue to rule unchallenged; monastery estates should not be confiscated; Tibetans should thank the Chinese for liberation but kindly ask them to leave and, in return, the Tibetan people would never ask for military assistance from the Chinese; and persuading the Chinese to \"please buy the [Tibetan] wool.\" The document then proceeded to provide intelligence on various undesired actions taken by the Chinese including forcing the Dalai Lama to give a  speech the threat of death, kidnapping over 200 children for the purpose of retraining them (one was even beheaded as a warning to the others not to cry and complain), and the installation of a puppet governor at Kham.

Airfields could specifically be an advantage as Tibet could then be used as a refueling station between China and India allowing for China to fly extended combat missions over India and target its northern cities. Additionally, as the highest geographical point, Tibet could maintain an aerial advantage over the region.  A CIA information report dated July 31, 1953, reveals the CIA was closely monitoring Chinese projects in Tibet. The report notes that earlier that year Chinese soldiers \"attempted to build airfields at Lhasa,\" the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Gartok, now called Gharyarsa. However, the Dalai Lama disapproved of the project, and the soldiers ceased construction of the airfields. In May 1953, over 1,000 Chinese soldiers marched to the Chumbi Valley with five field artillery pieces.

Providing aid to the Tibetans continued to occur in the reports flowing in and out of the CIA. Several reports documented the economic needs of Tibetans and compared them to the known resources of the Chinese Communists in the Tibetan Army District. Control of the few networks of roads traversing the mountainous terrain granted the Chinese Communists access to the resources they needed to sustain military occupation. This was problematic for the Americans who needed a way to provide any aid to the Tibetan resistance movements. However, the reports weighing the logistics and costs of supplying aid to the Tibetans revealed that American interests were fueled by opposition to the Chinese Communists rather than a support of Tibetan liberation.

These rebels claimed an \"independent kingdom of Tibet\" when they decided to resist the Chinese outpost.<ref name=\":3\" /> To try and get the rebels to back down the Chinese attempted to kidnap the Dalai Lama, leading, in turn, to the 1959 Tibetan Uprising in which thousands took to the streets to stop the supposed kidnapping. A 1959 DCI briefing highlights the measures in which citizens took to protect the Dalai Lama. The report says, \"Thousands of Tibetan demonstrators then took the Dalai Lama into protective custody in his summer palace just outside Lhasa\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Chinese military forces murdered tens of thousands of Tibetans along with thousands more fleeing behind the Dalai Lama. During this revolt, supporters were reported to have \"knocked out a Chinese outpost manned by 80 soldiers, interrupted communications with Peiping, and plastered walls of Lhasa with posters declaring 'independent kingdom of Tibet.'\"<ref name=\":3\" /> The Chinese attempted to make the Dalai Lama stop the uprising, but they could not, which then led to his flight to India.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Dalai\u2019s clandestine departure to India started\u00a0on March 17, 1959 involved him wearing a disguise where he dressed as a soldier and moved with a column of troops to the Indian border. Resistance fighters smuggled him out of the Potala and through rebel-held territory. Two troops who met the Dalai\u2019s escort along the way were trained by the CIA and they reached back to their American contacts via radio to secure permission for the Dalai and his troops to enter India. Permission was granted.<ref name=\":7\" /> Prior to his flight to India (due to shots being fired outside the palace), Dalai and the Tibet representative were sending letters back and forth to each other in hopes of avoiding an attack. Dalai continued fighting for independence for Tibet outside India. Finally, with the hope of halting Chinese aggression and demands, India recognized Tibet as part of China.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1959, the Dalai Lama and approximately 100,000 followers fled to India and Nepal.<ref name=\"Online\" /> The rebels continued to attack Chinese government officials, disrupting communication lines, and targeting Chinese troops.<ref name=\"nyrtibet\" /> Following a mass uprising in [[Lhasa]] in 1959 during the celebration of the [[Tibetan New Year]] and the ensuing Chinese military response, the Dalai Lama went into exile in India.<ref name=\"The CIA 2002\" />  At this point, the Chinese began changing their policy of working through institutions to build the Communist Party in Tibet.  They began to replace the government with Communist-sponsored leaders.  By this time the rebels were under constant Chinese attack and losing the remaining ground that they controlled.<ref name=\":3\" />  A declassified DCI briefing of the Senate Foreign Relation Committee offered some further elaboration on the Dalai Lama's position in India.  The Dalai Lama remained insistent on wanting to establish a free Tibet which threatened his asylum in India. Prime Minister Nehru vowed to protect the Dalai Lama's right to practice his spirituality but would not condone any anti-communist politics coming from the Dalai Lama. Nehru's main reason for this was that India had previously recognized Tibet as a part of China.  The evidence seemed to imply that popular Indian sentiment and reactions to this policy caused Nehru to become more sympathetic toward Tibet, yet unfortunately the rest of this section was redacted from the public record.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFrom 1959\u20131960, the CIA parachuted four groups of Camp Hale trainees to meet up with the Tibetan resistance.  In Autumn of 1959, the CIA parachuted the second group of sixteen men into Chagra Pembar to meet up with the resistance.  By January 1960 the CIA parachuted the fourth and last team into Tibet. Along with these air drops, the CIA also provided pallets of lethal aid to the resistance including rifles, mortars, grenades, and machine guns.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" />  All the CIA trained Tibetans from Camp Hale left with personal weapons, wireless sets, and a cyanide tablet strapped onto each man's left wrist.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2013/04/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/|title=Tibet: The CIA's Cancelled War|last=Mirsky|first=Jonathan|website=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2017-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance movement did accomplish the job of bringing great cost and distraction to the Chinese government.  CIA estimates in 1959 were that the Chinese had around 60,000 troops in Tibet and needed 256 tons of supplies daily.  Due to there only being 3 viable transport routes into Tibet,<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T01049A001900130001-6.pdf|title=LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS OF THE TIBETAN CAMPAIGN (43.2492) {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> the CIA also estimated that if they could get the Chinese to double the needed supplies, then the existing infrastructure would not be able to keep up with supply without supplementary airlifts or construction to repair existing routes.  The CIA estimated that even with these supplemental airlifts, it would cause substantial disruption in other air services and the Chinese could not expect to supply double its commitments long-term. The [[China National Highway 109|Lanzhou-Lhasa highway]] was the ideal logistical land supply route at 2,148&nbsp; km long. The CIA took into consideration factors including road construction, width, grades, curves, bottlenecks, and road conditions impacted by weather. The CIA estimated China could support up to 90,000 troops in Tibet for a few months, but only 60,000 for an extended deployment. In order to support 90,000 troops in the region, China would have to use the Lan-chou-Lhasa highway to its capacity and would require around 7,000 supply trucks per month.  However, such heavy usage of the road was estimated to cause substantial damage.<ref name=\":6\" />  The CIA also considered how a build-up of Chinese troops would affect the railroads and determined that, although congestion could impose some burden on the supply chain, there would be no significant effect on the lines. However, if one of the lines failed due to a washout or other reason, supplies would have to be trucked into the staging areas, which the CIA determined would be a time-consuming operation. Petroleum usage in Tibet was estimated at 2.7% of China's total availability, with a total usage of around 200,000 tons for the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/cia-rdp70t00666r000100100020-2.pdf|title=Transmittal of Paper on Impact of the Tibetan Campaign on the Economy of Communist China {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>  The \"blue satchel raid\" of the Chinese was considered one of the greatest intelligence hauls in the history of the CIA.  This raid obtained Chinese government documents that showed them having trouble moving forward with the spread of communism through Tibet.  It also gave the CIA good insight into what was going on in China, and for the first time, they possessed authentic Chinese documents that were not forged or given to them by a rogue agent.  This changed the focus of the CIA as they informed the Tibetans not to attack the Chinese but rather to gather intelligence on their enemy.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" /> Despite these orders from the CIA, yearly raids during the winter months continued on Chinese encampments and harassment of communist outposts, troops and convoys continued.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1959, CIA issued assessment documents that highlighted the background, logistical issues, and the international fallout in regard to Tibet. One paper, entitled \u201cTibet and China (Background Papers),\u201d described the history and geography of Tibet. The CIA assessed that the economy of Tibet had not changed despite eight years of Chinese rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf|title=Tibet and China (Background Information)|last=CIA|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The agency concluded that rebellions against Chinese communists would continue in Tibet throughout the years, but believed that the rebellions could not damage the hold that China had on Tibet. The CIA believed that the Chinese aggression in Tibet had severely damaged China's standing within Afro-Asian countries. By reasserting control over Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama into exile, China had gone against the image as a neutral peacemaker in the region that they had been cultivating since the Bandung Conference in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Tibet and China: Background Paper |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf |date=April 27, 1959}}</ref> In the briefing note, the CIA stated that the governments of neutral Asian countries, notably India and Burma, had encouraged press and popular opposition to Chinese aggression in Tibet. This was despite the fact that the governments did not formally sanction China for their actions.<ref name=\":3\" /> The background paper specified that one of the strongest reaction to China was from Malaya in which the Foreign Minister condemned the action and likened it to Soviet harsh responses in Hungary. Prince Norodom Sihanouk from Cambodia also showed his sympathy to Tibet and \"expressing surprise\" that Prime Minister Nehru did not take firmer action against Peking. There were protests on China's repression in Tibet as shown in the section of the press in some countries such as Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Japan, and the United Arab Republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf|title=Tibet and China (Background Paper)|last=Central Intelligence Agency|date=27 April 1959|website=Central Intelligence Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>  Another report, \u201cLogistical Problems of the Tibetan Campaign,\u201d studied the strengths, weaknesses, and power of the Chinese military in Tibet.

The CIA conducted studies on how the Tibetan resistance movement could best counter the Chinese Communists. Therefore, the CIA worked with the leaders of the campaign to garner more support for the resistance as well as manage the logistics of the movement of these troops. The CIA examined the difficulty in moving the additional forces necessary to counter the Chinese. This logistical conundrum meant that the CIA was giving recommendations for the capacity and ability of roadways to support the troop movements. Without this logistical support, the Tibetans could not sufficiently counter the Chinese Communists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP80-00809A000700210056-2|title=POLITICAL - DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> However, a declassified CIA document from July 1958 outlined the agency's assessment of the possibility that Communists would infiltrate Tibetan society, and completely assimilate all aspects of Tibetan life into the culture of Communist China.\n\nThe CIA was aware of China's attempts at enacting cultural assimilation in Tibet and, therefore, they wanted to take measures to counteract that possibility. However, according to the document, the possibility of the \"complete integration,\" of \"political, social, and economic\" aspects of Tibetan life was not substantial.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79-01006A000100090001-7|title=RESISTANCE IN TIBET {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n\nLong before the current Chinese occupation, Tibet had a longstanding tradition of independence. The memo cites numerous historical accounts of Chinese attempts at conquering and controlling Tibet, none of which ended in success or the integration of Tibet into Chinese society. The documents also mention the problematic \"terrain, climate, and location\" of Tibet. Tibet contains protruding mountains, massive plateaus, deep river valleys, and gaping gorges that make communication and military operations extremely arduous. The topography of the region enhanced the isolation felt by large swaths of the population, allowing for guerrilla warfare to thrive and causing \"political fragmentation among the Kham,\" the southeastern region of Tibet. Because most Tibetans are peasants and not monks or nobles, they have experience with the terrain and are often nomads. This nomadic propensity consequently effects how they maintain their independent spirit<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The Chinese focused substantial resources on keeping roads and supply lines functioning, a difficult task in Tibet's challenging landscape. Other CIA documents reaffirm this notion, by recognizing the enormous cost of resupplying operatives and keeping supply chains moving in the country.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe July 1985 document also cites the structure of Tibetan society as a primary source of trouble for the Chinese. Tibetan society revolves around the Lamaist Church, and its spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The Dalai Lama was not merely a spiritual guide, but a political and ideological leader. Tibetan monasteries were more than just houses of worship, they were the economic and political centers of Tibetan society, which allowed the clergy to wield considerable power. The clergy was conservative and extremely traditionalistic. This traditionalism meant that any deviation from traditional Tibetan life was strictly opposed. Altogether, the author suggests that the socialization of Tibet may be \"prolonged\" despite the substantial investments of the Chinese to integrate the area. Tibetan's spirit for independence, the country's fractured and isolated population, the harsh Chinese policies, and the Chinese military occupation all contribute to the problems that the Chinese have had in controlling the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nThe [[McMahon Line]], proposed in 1914 by British colonial administrator [[Henry McMahon]], is the demarcation line between Tibet and the North-east region of India, stretches along the crest ridge of the Himalayas. The Chinese, however, refuse to accept the McMahon Line as the legal boundary. Nevertheless, India remains adamant that it stands. With this disagreement, the Chinese believe that they have grounds for charging Indian troops with the invasion of their territory.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79r00890a001100090004-2|title=Sino-Indian Border Dispute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tibet is predominantly composed of rugged terrain, with plateaus, mountains and deep river valleys.<ref name=\"TibetChina\" /> However, the land has never been surveyed, and no markers have been placed thus providing room for disagreement.\n\nIn 1972, before the seismic head of state meeting between Chairman Mao and President Nixon, the CIA cut off all support to the Tibetan resistance as American foreign policy objectives in China, emblematic of Nixon and Kissinger's drive for an open door policy with China, underwent a rapid transformation. As a result, each of the 1,500 CIA-trained rebels received 10,000 rupees to buy land in India or to open a business instead of fighting the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China. Additionally, the [[White House]] decided that the training of Tibetan guerrillas by the CIA would have to cease because the risk of damaging [[Sino-American relations]] would be too high and costly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen Talty|title=The Dalai Lama's Great Escape|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/12/31/dalai-lamas-escape-from-tibet-and-the-cias-role.html|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=Dec 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis rebellion was one of the greatest intelligence successes of the Cold War because of the significant amount of Chinese military documents captured by Tibetan fighters and given to the CIA.\n\nThe CIA is alleged to have been involved in another failed revolt in October 1987 resulting in unrest and the continuation of Chinese repression until May 1993.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\n== Contemporary Tibet-China Relationship ==\nAlthough the Chinese liberalization program for Tibet occurred decades ago, there is still tension between the two parties, in part, because of the U.S. involvement. In late September 2012, a U.S. Ambassador visited Beijing but also met with Tibetan monks. The Ambassador is Gary Locke, who himself is a third-generation Chinese American. The fact that he met with Tibetan monks displeased China. The tension between Tibet and China has influenced the Chinese to \"always protests vehemently whenever U.S. officials meet with the Dalai Lama.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nChina also faces opposition movements from the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, an autonomous region of northwest China, as well as the Falun Gong or Falun Dafa. Inspired by these tensions and domestic schisms, the CIA is thought to look for the right opportunity to destabilize Chinese rule in Tibet.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\nMany foreign policy officials in Washington continue to view China with a critical eye aided in their assessment by CIA assessments of China's non-cooperation in the war on terror. China is often uncooperative in stopping the arms flow across western China to southeast Asia in support of Islamic extremism.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\nModernization has also made it easier for the Chinese to resupply due in part to the construction of the first railway into Tibet occurring between 2001 and 2007. This railway makes for easier movement of troops and equipment.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\n== Costs ==\nThe following table illustrates the costs of the CIA's Tibetan program in 1964:\n\nA total of 1,735,000 dollars was devoted to the Tibetan program for FY1964\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ffdead;\" |Item\n!style=\"background: #ffdead;\" |Cost\n|-\n| Tibetan resistance efforts in Nepal\n| US$500,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Tibet Houses in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Geneva]] (1/2 year)\n| US$75,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Training\n| US$855,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Subsidy to the [[Dalai Lama]]\n| US$180,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Miscellaneous costs\n| US$125,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n|}\n\nMoreover, the estimate for the Tibetan program underwent an estimated budget cut of $570,000 in 1968 when the United States relinquished all related training programs. The remaining $1,165,000 was allocated to the CIA budget for the program in the fiscal year 1968. However, a considerable degree of uncertainty exists regarding the exact amount approved for the program during this time due to classification issues.<ref name=\"officiehis\" />\n\n== International lobbying ==\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] was financially supported by the CIA between the late 1950s and the mid-1970s, receiving $180,000 per annum.

The CIA used the line of communication with Thondup to cultivate a credible source of intelligence on the ground and administer possible operations moving forward. Thondup described mounting Tibetan hostility toward the occupying Chinese Communist forces and the recent armed conflict in Lhasa between Tibetan demonstrators and Chinese Communist military police. From the intelligence, the CIA learned of the 10,000-15,000 Chinese troops stationed in Tibet. A dire food shortage also exacerbated tensions as Tibetans found it increasingly difficult provide food for the people. Furthermore, the communication with Thondup revealed the workings of covert actions from Tibetans who refused to follow the Dalai Lama\u2019s acceptance of Chinese Communist occupation. The CIA and the State Department both expressed optimism with the circumstances in Tibet and Lhasa, believing that they could maneuver accordingly.<ref>Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952\u20131954, China and Japan, Volume XIV, PART 1 611.93B/5\u20131452 No. 26 Memorandum by the Acting Director of the Office of Chinese Affairs (Perkins) to the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs (Allison) May 14, 1952.</ref>\n\nIn September 1952, a CIA intelligence report noted the difficulty in continuing to support the Tibetan resistance when the Chinese Communist government and the massive People's Liberation Army (PLA) fully occupied the country. As a result of this Chinese domination over the Tibetans, direct diplomatic relations between Tibet and India ceased. A daily Hindi newspaper reported that this move had ended 16 years of direct contact between the governments of India and Tibet. India was able to have direct communications until that point because China's authority in Tibet was still limited. In the final paragraph of the article, the newspaper writes, \"The Chinese occupation of Tibet a year ago has changed this relationship. The cause was inevitable, and India had no choice but to accept this arrangement because the Chinese Communists now have complete control of the foreign affairs of Tibet\". Previously, India had provided a link for United States' support to the Tibetan resistance.<ref name=\"cia.gov\" /> Later that year (December 1952), the CIA produced an Information Report (Classification: Secret) containing two items in the subject line: 1) Anti-Communist Activities, Tibet, and 2) Chinese Communist Activities, Tibet. The document shows that the agency was closely scrutinizing both Tibetan and Chinese groups and individuals at the time, as well as any other obtained intelligence. The report defines the anti-Communist Tibetan People's Party and identified geographic areas where the Party's support was strongest. A 36-year old leader, Lhopto Rimpochhe was named as the leader of the \"warrior monks.\" The document goes on to report on intelligence regarding a petition sent to the Chinese authorities in Lhasa by Ragashar Shape, Tibetan Defense Minister,<ref>{{Cite book |title = Tibet: An Unfinished Story |last=Halper |first=Lezlee Brown and Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn = 978-0-19-936836-5 |location=New York, New York |page = 119 |quote= }}</ref> that went ignored. The Shape petition included the following points: the Dalai Lama should continue to rule unchallenged; monastery estates should not be confiscated; Tibetans should thank the Chinese for liberation but kindly ask them to leave and, in return, the Tibetan people would never ask for military assistance from the Chinese; and persuading the Chinese to \"please buy the [Tibetan] wool.\" The document then proceeded to provide intelligence on various undesired actions taken by the Chinese including forcing the Dalai Lama to give a  speech the threat of death, kidnapping over 200 children for the purpose of retraining them (one was even beheaded as a warning to the others not to cry and complain), and the installation of a puppet governor at Kham.

Airfields could specifically be an advantage as Tibet could then be used as a refueling station between China and India allowing for China to fly extended combat missions over India and target its northern cities. Additionally, as the highest geographical point, Tibet could maintain an aerial advantage over the region.  A CIA information report dated July 31, 1953, reveals the CIA was closely monitoring Chinese projects in Tibet. The report notes that earlier that year Chinese soldiers \"attempted to build airfields at Lhasa,\" the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Gartok, now called Gharyarsa. However, the Dalai Lama disapproved of the project, and the soldiers ceased construction of the airfields. In May 1953, over 1,000 Chinese soldiers marched to the Chumbi Valley with five field artillery pieces.

It was in the shared interest of both Tibet and the United States to limit the power of the Chinese within Tibet's borders.

However, their request for an audience was refused by Lord Chamberlain, [[Phala Thubten Wonden]], who believed such a meeting would be unwise. According to [[Tsering Shakya]], \"Phala never told the Dalai Lama or the [[Kashag]] of the arrival of Athar and Lhotse.

Providing aid to the Tibetans continued to occur in the reports flowing in and out of the CIA. Several reports documented the economic needs of Tibetans and compared them to the known resources of the Chinese Communists in the Tibetan Army District. Control of the few networks of roads traversing the mountainous terrain granted the Chinese Communists access to the resources they needed to sustain military occupation. This was problematic for the Americans who needed a way to provide any aid to the Tibetan resistance movements. However, the reports weighing the logistics and costs of supplying aid to the Tibetans revealed that American interests were fueled by opposition to the Chinese Communists rather than a support of Tibetan liberation. The report ultimately concluded that the economic effort required to support troops in Tibet would only have a \u201cmodest if not almost negligible impact on the economy of Communist China.\u201d<ref>\"Transmittal of Paper on Impact of the Tibetan Campaign on the Economy of Communist China | CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)\" (PDF). www.cia.gov.

These rebels displayed a sizeable outbreak in March 1959 because they feared that the Chinese were planning to take the Dalai Lama from the country.<ref name=\":3\" /> Since they had feared he risked kidnapping, they decided to protect him by moving him to an area that was located just outside Lhasa. These rebels claimed an \"independent kingdom of Tibet\" when they decided to resist the Chinese outpost.<ref name=\":3\" /> To try and get the rebels to back down the Chinese attempted to kidnap the Dalai Lama, leading, in turn, to the 1959 Tibetan Uprising in which thousands took to the streets to stop the supposed kidnapping. A 1959 DCI briefing highlights the measures in which citizens took to protect the Dalai Lama. The report says, \"Thousands of Tibetan demonstrators then took the Dalai Lama into protective custody in his summer palace just outside Lhasa\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Chinese military forces murdered tens of thousands of Tibetans along with thousands more fleeing behind the Dalai Lama. During this revolt, supporters were reported to have \"knocked out a Chinese outpost manned by 80 soldiers, interrupted communications with Peiping, and plastered walls of Lhasa with posters declaring 'independent kingdom of Tibet.'\"<ref name=\":3\" /> The Chinese attempted to make the Dalai Lama stop the uprising, but they could not, which then led to his flight to India.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Dalai\u2019s clandestine departure to India started\u00a0on March 17, 1959 involved him wearing a disguise where he dressed as a soldier and moved with a column of troops to the Indian border. Resistance fighters smuggled him out of the Potala and through rebel-held territory. Two troops who met the Dalai\u2019s escort along the way were trained by the CIA and they reached back to their American contacts via radio to secure permission for the Dalai and his troops to enter India. Permission was granted.<ref name=\":7\" /> Prior to his flight to India (due to shots being fired outside the palace), Dalai and the Tibet representative were sending letters back and forth to each other in hopes of avoiding an attack. Dalai continued fighting for independence for Tibet outside India. Finally, with the hope of halting Chinese aggression and demands, India recognized Tibet as part of China.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1959, the Dalai Lama and approximately 100,000 followers fled to India and Nepal.<ref name=\"Online\" /> The rebels continued to attack Chinese government officials, disrupting communication lines, and targeting Chinese troops.<ref name=\"nyrtibet\" /> Following a mass uprising in [[Lhasa]] in 1959 during the celebration of the [[Tibetan New Year]] and the ensuing Chinese military response, the Dalai Lama went into exile in India.<ref name=\"The CIA 2002\" />  At this point, the Chinese began changing their policy of working through institutions to build the Communist Party in Tibet.  They began to replace the government with Communist-sponsored leaders.  By this time the rebels were under constant Chinese attack and losing the remaining ground that they controlled.<ref name=\":3\" />  A declassified DCI briefing of the Senate Foreign Relation Committee offered some further elaboration on the Dalai Lama's position in India.  The Dalai Lama remained insistent on wanting to establish a free Tibet which threatened his asylum in India. Prime Minister Nehru vowed to protect the Dalai Lama's right to practice his spirituality but would not condone any anti-communist politics coming from the Dalai Lama. Nehru's main reason for this was that India had previously recognized Tibet as a part of China.  The evidence seemed to imply that popular Indian sentiment and reactions to this policy caused Nehru to become more sympathetic toward Tibet, yet unfortunately the rest of this section was redacted from the public record.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFrom 1959\u20131960, the CIA parachuted four groups of Camp Hale trainees to meet up with the Tibetan resistance.  In Autumn of 1959, the CIA parachuted the second group of sixteen men into Chagra Pembar to meet up with the resistance.  By January 1960 the CIA parachuted the fourth and last team into Tibet. Along with these air drops, the CIA also provided pallets of lethal aid to the resistance including rifles, mortars, grenades, and machine guns.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" />  All the CIA trained Tibetans from Camp Hale left with personal weapons, wireless sets, and a cyanide tablet strapped onto each man's left wrist.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2013/04/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/|title=Tibet: The CIA's Cancelled War|last=Mirsky|first=Jonathan|website=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2017-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance movement did accomplish the job of bringing great cost and distraction to the Chinese government.  CIA estimates in 1959 were that the Chinese had around 60,000 troops in Tibet and needed 256 tons of supplies daily.  Due to there only being 3 viable transport routes into Tibet,<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T01049A001900130001-6.pdf|title=LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS OF THE TIBETAN CAMPAIGN (43.2492) {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> the CIA also estimated that if they could get the Chinese to double the needed supplies, then the existing infrastructure would not be able to keep up with supply without supplementary airlifts or construction to repair existing routes.  The CIA estimated that even with these supplemental airlifts, it would cause substantial disruption in other air services and the Chinese could not expect to supply double its commitments long-term. The [[China National Highway 109|Lanzhou-Lhasa highway]] was the ideal logistical land supply route at 2,148&nbsp; km long. The CIA took into consideration factors including road construction, width, grades, curves, bottlenecks, and road conditions impacted by weather. The CIA estimated China could support up to 90,000 troops in Tibet for a few months, but only 60,000 for an extended deployment. In order to support 90,000 troops in the region, China would have to use the Lan-chou-Lhasa highway to its capacity and would require around 7,000 supply trucks per month.  However, such heavy usage of the road was estimated to cause substantial damage.<ref name=\":6\" />  The CIA also considered how a build-up of Chinese troops would affect the railroads and determined that, although congestion could impose some burden on the supply chain, there would be no significant effect on the lines. However, if one of the lines failed due to a washout or other reason, supplies would have to be trucked into the staging areas, which the CIA determined would be a time-consuming operation. Petroleum usage in Tibet was estimated at 2.7% of China's total availability, with a total usage of around 200,000 tons for the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/cia-rdp70t00666r000100100020-2.pdf|title=Transmittal of Paper on Impact of the Tibetan Campaign on the Economy of Communist China {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>  The \"blue satchel raid\" of the Chinese was considered one of the greatest intelligence hauls in the history of the CIA.  This raid obtained Chinese government documents that showed them having trouble moving forward with the spread of communism through Tibet.  It also gave the CIA good insight into what was going on in China, and for the first time, they possessed authentic Chinese documents that were not forged or given to them by a rogue agent.  This changed the focus of the CIA as they informed the Tibetans not to attack the Chinese but rather to gather intelligence on their enemy.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" /> Despite these orders from the CIA, yearly raids during the winter months continued on Chinese encampments and harassment of communist outposts, troops and convoys continued.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1959, CIA issued assessment documents that highlighted the background, logistical issues, and the international fallout in regard to Tibet. One paper, entitled \u201cTibet and China (Background Papers),\u201d described the history and geography of Tibet. The CIA assessed that the economy of Tibet had not changed despite eight years of Chinese rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf|title=Tibet and China (Background Information)|last=CIA|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The agency concluded that rebellions against Chinese communists would continue in Tibet throughout the years, but believed that the rebellions could not damage the hold that China had on Tibet. The CIA believed that the Chinese aggression in Tibet had severely damaged China's standing within Afro-Asian countries. By reasserting control over Tibet and forcing the Dalai Lama into exile, China had gone against the image as a neutral peacemaker in the region that they had been cultivating since the Bandung Conference in 1955.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Tibet and China: Background Paper |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf |date=April 27, 1959}}</ref> In the briefing note, the CIA stated that the governments of neutral Asian countries, notably India and Burma, had encouraged press and popular opposition to Chinese aggression in Tibet.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk from Cambodia also showed his sympathy to Tibet and \"expressing surprise\" that Prime Minister Nehru did not take firmer action against Peking. There were protests on China's repression in Tibet as shown in the section of the press in some countries such as Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Japan, and the United Arab Republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP82R00025R000100060022-5.pdf|title=Tibet and China (Background Paper)|last=Central Intelligence Agency|date=27 April 1959|website=Central Intelligence Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>  Another report, \u201cLogistical Problems of the Tibetan Campaign,\u201d studied the strengths, weaknesses, and power of the Chinese military in Tibet.

The CIA conducted studies on how the Tibetan resistance movement could best counter the Chinese Communists. Therefore, the CIA worked with the leaders of the campaign to garner more support for the resistance as well as manage the logistics of the movement of these troops. The CIA examined the difficulty in moving the additional forces necessary to counter the Chinese. This logistical conundrum meant that the CIA was giving recommendations for the capacity and ability of roadways to support the troop movements. Without this logistical support, the Tibetans could not sufficiently counter the Chinese Communists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP80-00809A000700210056-2|title=POLITICAL - DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> However, a declassified CIA document from July 1958 outlined the agency's assessment of the possibility that Communists would infiltrate Tibetan society, and completely assimilate all aspects of Tibetan life into the culture of Communist China.\n\nThe CIA was aware of China's attempts at enacting cultural assimilation in Tibet and, therefore, they wanted to take measures to counteract that possibility. However, according to the document, the possibility of the \"complete integration,\" of \"political, social, and economic\" aspects of Tibetan life was not substantial.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/CIA-RDP79-01006A000100090001-7|title=RESISTANCE IN TIBET {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>\n\nLong before the current Chinese occupation, Tibet had a longstanding tradition of independence. The memo cites numerous historical accounts of Chinese attempts at conquering and controlling Tibet, none of which ended in success or the integration of Tibet into Chinese society. The documents also mention the problematic \"terrain, climate, and location\" of Tibet. Tibet contains protruding mountains, massive plateaus, deep river valleys, and gaping gorges that make communication and military operations extremely arduous. The topography of the region enhanced the isolation felt by large swaths of the population, allowing for guerrilla warfare to thrive and causing \"political fragmentation among the Kham,\" the southeastern region of Tibet. Because most Tibetans are peasants and not monks or nobles, they have experience with the terrain and are often nomads. This nomadic propensity consequently effects how they maintain their independent spirit<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The Chinese focused substantial resources on keeping roads and supply lines functioning, a difficult task in Tibet's challenging landscape. Other CIA documents reaffirm this notion, by recognizing the enormous cost of resupplying operatives and keeping supply chains moving in the country.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe July 1985 document also cites the structure of Tibetan society as a primary source of trouble for the Chinese. Tibetan society revolves around the Lamaist Church, and its spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The Dalai Lama was not merely a spiritual guide, but a political and ideological leader. Tibetan monasteries were more than just houses of worship, they were the economic and political centers of Tibetan society, which allowed the clergy to wield considerable power. The clergy was conservative and extremely traditionalistic. This traditionalism meant that any deviation from traditional Tibetan life was strictly opposed. Altogether, the author suggests that the socialization of Tibet may be \"prolonged\" despite the substantial investments of the Chinese to integrate the area. Tibetan's spirit for independence, the country's fractured and isolated population, the harsh Chinese policies, and the Chinese military occupation all contribute to the problems that the Chinese have had in controlling the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nThe [[McMahon Line]], proposed in 1914 by British colonial administrator [[Henry McMahon]], is the demarcation line between Tibet and the North-east region of India, stretches along the crest ridge of the Himalayas. The Chinese, however, refuse to accept the McMahon Line as the legal boundary. Nevertheless, India remains adamant that it stands. With this disagreement, the Chinese believe that they have grounds for charging Indian troops with the invasion of their territory.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp79r00890a001100090004-2|title=Sino-Indian Border Dispute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tibet is predominantly composed of rugged terrain, with plateaus, mountains and deep river valleys.<ref name=\"TibetChina\" /> However, the land has never been surveyed, and no markers have been placed thus providing room for disagreement.\n\nIn 1972, before the seismic head of state meeting between Chairman Mao and President Nixon, the CIA cut off all support to the Tibetan resistance as American foreign policy objectives in China, emblematic of Nixon and Kissinger's drive for an open door policy with China, underwent a rapid transformation. As a result, each of the 1,500 CIA-trained rebels received 10,000 rupees to buy land in India or to open a business instead of fighting the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China. Additionally, the [[White House]] decided that the training of Tibetan guerrillas by the CIA would have to cease because the risk of damaging [[Sino-American relations]] would be too high and costly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stephen Talty|title=The Dalai Lama's Great Escape|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/12/31/dalai-lamas-escape-from-tibet-and-the-cias-role.html|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=Dec 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis rebellion was one of the greatest intelligence successes of the Cold War because of the significant amount of Chinese military documents captured by Tibetan fighters and given to the CIA.\n\nThe CIA is alleged to have been involved in another failed revolt in October 1987 resulting in unrest and the continuation of Chinese repression until May 1993.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\n== Contemporary Tibet-China Relationship ==\nAlthough the Chinese liberalization program for Tibet occurred decades ago, there is still tension between the two parties, in part, because of the U.S. involvement. In late September 2012, a U.S. Ambassador visited Beijing but also met with Tibetan monks. The Ambassador is Gary Locke, who himself is a third-generation Chinese American. The fact that he met with Tibetan monks displeased China. The tension between Tibet and China has influenced the Chinese to \"always protests vehemently whenever U.S. officials meet with the Dalai Lama.\" <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nChina also faces opposition movements from the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, an autonomous region of northwest China, as well as the Falun Gong or Falun Dafa. Inspired by these tensions and domestic schisms, the CIA is thought to look for the right opportunity to destabilize Chinese rule in Tibet.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\nMany foreign policy officials in Washington continue to view China with a critical eye aided in their assessment by CIA assessments of China's non-cooperation in the war on terror. China is often uncooperative in stopping the arms flow across western China to southeast Asia in support of Islamic extremism.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\nModernization has also made it easier for the Chinese to resupply due in part to the construction of the first railway into Tibet occurring between 2001 and 2007. This railway makes for easier movement of troops and equipment.<ref name=\"Online\" />\n\n== Costs ==\nThe following table illustrates the costs of the CIA's Tibetan program in 1964:\n\nA total of 1,735,000 dollars was devoted to the Tibetan program for FY1964\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background: #ffdead;\" |Item\n!style=\"background: #ffdead;\" |Cost\n|-\n| Tibetan resistance efforts in Nepal\n| US$500,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Tibet Houses in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Geneva]] (1/2 year)\n| US$75,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Training\n| US$855,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Subsidy to the [[Dalai Lama]]\n| US$180,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n| Miscellaneous costs\n| US$125,000<ref name=jan26cia />\n|-\n|}\n\nMoreover, the estimate for the Tibetan program underwent an estimated budget cut of $570,000 in 1968 when the United States relinquished all related training programs. The remaining $1,165,000 was allocated to the CIA budget for the program in the fiscal year 1968. However, a considerable degree of uncertainty exists regarding the exact amount approved for the program during this time due to classification issues.<ref name=\"officiehis\" />\n\n== International lobbying ==\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] was financially supported by the CIA between the late 1950s and the mid-1970s, receiving $180,000 per annum.

The country which was then composed of different kingdoms and thalassocracies oversaw the large number of merchants coming to the islands for trade. [[Indian people|Indian]], [[Arabian people|Arab]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were welcomed by these kingdoms, which were mostly located by riverbanks, coastal ports and central plains. The merchants traded for goods such as gold, rice, pots and other products. The [[barter system]] was implemented at that time and the pre-colonial people enjoyed a life filled with imported goods which reflected their fashion and lifestyle.\n\nFrom the 12th century, a huge industry centred around the manufacture and trade of burnay clay pots, used for the storage of tea and other perishables, was set up in the northern Philippines with Japanese and Okinawan traders. These pots were known as 'Ruson-tsukuri' (Luzon-made) in Japanese, and were considered among the best storage vessels used for the purpose of keeping tea leaves and rice wine fresh. Hence, Ruson-Tsukuri pots became sought after in Northeast Asia. Each Philippine kiln had its own branding symbol, marked on the bottom of the Ruson-tsukuri by a single [[baybayin]] letter.\n\nThe people also were great agriculturists and the islands especifically [[Luzon]] has great abundance of rice, fowls, wine as well as great numbers of carabaos, deer, wild boar and goats. In addition, there were also great quantities of cotton and colored clothes, wax, honey and date palms produced by the natives. The precolonial state of [[Caboloan]]  in [[Pangasinan]] often exported deer-skins to [[Japan]] and [[Okinawa]]. The Nation of [[Ma-i]] produced beeswax, cotton, true pearls, tortoise shell, medicinal betel nuts and yuta cloth in their trade with East Asia. By the early sixteenth century, the two largest polities of the [[List of islands in the Greater Manila Area|Pasig River delta]], [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods throughout the rest of the Philippine archipelago.<ref name=\"Dery2001\">{{cite book | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | authorlink =  | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | year = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | pages =  | volume =  | edition =  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-971-10-1069-0  }}</ref>\n\nThe Visayas islands which is home to the [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], the Kedatuan of Dapitan and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] on the other hand were abundant in rice, fish, cotton, swine, fowls, wax and honey. [[Leyte]] was said to produce two rice crops a year, and Pedro Chirino commented on the great rice and cotton harvests that were sufficient to feed and clothe the people.\n\nIn Mindanao, the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] specialized in the mining of gold and the manufacture of jewelry. The [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] was known for the raising and harvesting of [[cinnamon]]. The [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Sultanate of Lanao]] had a fishing industry by lake Lanao and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] had lively pearl-diving operations.\n\nThe kingdoms of ancient Philippines were active in international trade, and they used the ocean as natural highways.<ref name=\"great\">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html From the mountains to the seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521091413/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html |date=21 May 2009 }}.

The arrival of the Spanish removed this slavering system. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi with Tlaxcaltecs from Mexico conquered and unified the islands. The conquered was possible thanks to the discovery of the trip back to Mexico coast by Agustino Urdaneta. The administration of Islas Filipinas was done through the Capitania General and depended on Mexico Capital which formed the New Spain Viceroyalty. The economy of Islas Filipinas grew further when the Spanish government inaugurated the [[Manila Galleon]] trade system.

Trade also introduced foodstuffs such as [[maize]], [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[chili pepper]]s, [[chocolate]] and [[pineapple]]s from [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. [[Tobacco]], first domesticated in Latin-America, and then introduced to the Philippines, became an important cash crop for Filipinos. The Philippines also became the distribution center of silver mined in the Americas, which was in high demand in Asia, during the period.<ref>1996. \u201cSilk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century.\u201d Philippine Studies 44, 1:52-68.</ref> In exchange for this silver, Manila gathered Indonesian spices, Chinese silks and Indian gems to be exported to Mexico.<ref>Chuan, Hang-sheng. 2001. \u201cThe Chinese Silk Trade with Spanish-America from the Late Ming Period to the Mid-Ch\u2019ing Period.\u201d In Studia Asiatica Essays in Asian Studies in Felicitation to the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of Professor Ch\u2019en Shouyi, ed.

Nevertheless, it didn't affect the economy of the islands.\n\nOn 10 March 1785, [[King Charles III of Spain]] confirmed the establishment of the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter. The Basque-based company was granted a monopoly on the importation of Chinese and Indian goods into the Philippines, as well as the shipping of the goods directly to Spain via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eang|first=Cheong Weng|date=1970|title=Changing the Rules of the Game (The India-Manila Trade: 1785\u20131809)1|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/changing-the-rules-of-the-game-the-indiamanila-trade-178518091/DFED0589509EC155F2EC9C91A201D637|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1017/S002246340002021X|issn=1474-0680|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Spanish East Indies (1815\u201398) ===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 150\n| image1 = La Yndia del Campo tiendera by Justiniano Asuncion.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''La Yndia del Campo tiendera'' (A Native Filipina Rural Merchant) by [[Justiniano Asuncion]])\n| image2 = La Yndia del Campo Tendedora by Justiniano Asuncion.jpg\n| caption2 = ''La Yndia del Campo Tendedora'' (A Native Filipina Field Tender / Farmer) by [[Justiniano Asuncion]]\n}}\n[[File:Escolta Manila.jpg|thumb|200px|Calle Escolta, the economic center of 19th-century Manila]]\n[[File:PHI-A8-El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino-10 pesos (1896).jpg|thumb|150px|El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, 10 pesos bank note (1896)]]\nAfter Spain lost Mexico as a territory, New Spain was dissolved making the Philippines and other Pacific islands to form the [[Spanish East Indies]]. This resulted in the Philippines being governed directly by the [[King of Spain]] and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] while the Pacific islands of [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Guam]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Palau]] was governed by the [[Real Audiencia of Manila]] and was part of the Philippine territorial governance.\n\nIt made the economy of the Philippines grow further as people saw the rise of opportunities. Agriculture remained the largest contributor to economy, being the largest producer of [[coffee]] in Asia as well as a large produce of [[tobacco]].\n\nIn [[Europe]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread from [[Great Britain]] during the period known as the [[Victorian Age]]. The industrialization of Europe created great demands for raw materials from the colonies, bringing with it investment and wealth, although this was very unevenly distributed. [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas|Governor-General Basco]] had opened the Philippines to this trade. Previously, the Philippines was seen as a trading post for international trade but in the nineteenth century it was developed both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods. The economy of the Philippines rose rapidly and its local industries developed to satisfy the rising demands of an industrializing Europe. A small flow of European immigrants came with the opening of the Suez Canal, which cut the travel time between Europe and the Philippines by half. New ideas about government and society, which the friars and colonial authorities found dangerous, quickly found their way into the Philippines, notably through the Freemasons, who along with others, spread the ideals of the American, French and other revolutions, including Spanish liberalism.\n\nIn 1834 the Royal Company of the Philippines was abolished, and free trade was formally recognized. With its excellent harbor, Manila became an open port for Asian, European, and North American traders. European merchants alongside the Chinese immigrants opened stores selling goods from all parts of the world. The ''El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II ''(now the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]) was the first bank opened in the Philippines in 1851.\n\nIn 1873 additional ports were opened to foreign commerce, and by the late nineteenth century three crops\u2014tobacco, abaca, and sugar\u2014dominated Philippine exports.\n\n== First Philippine Republic (1899\u20131901) ==\n\nThe economy of the Philippines during the insurgency of the [[First Philippine Republic]] remained the same throughout its early years but was halted due to the break out of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Nevertheless, during the era of the First Republic, the estimated [[GDP per capita]] for the Philippines in 1900 was of $1,033.00. That made it the second richest place in all of Asia, just a little behind Japan ($1,135.00), and far ahead of China ($652.00) or India ($625.00).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_190-economy-gdp-per-capita-1900|title=GDP per capita in 1900 by country.

An initial high growth phase occurred during the 1910s due to the recovery from the wars with Spain and the US, and investment in agriculture. The Philippines would at first briefly outpace its neighbors. This would not last as growth fell behind in the later years. Stagnation in the late 1920s and beyond took place as access to US markets became restricted by protectionist quotas and fiscal restraints forestalled any further development in agriculture.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 465, June.</ref> \n\nThe growth period can be attributed to the results of a crash program in agricultural modernization undertaken in 1910\u20131920. This in turn was done in order to address the growing shortfall in the supply of rice. The Philippines once a net exporter became an importer of rice as a result of the wars with the Spanish and later the Americans and by the reallocation of labour to export crops.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 467, June.</ref>\n\nThe 1930s would mark the end to this period of relative prosperity. The Sugar Act of 1934 capped Philippines sugar exports to the US at 921,000 tons per year. Expenditure on public infrastructure for agriculture was reduced as the Payne\u2013Aldridge Act stripped the government of customs revenue. Manila hemp was now competing against the newly invented [[Nylon]]. Although the area of land cultivated for agriculture was still increasing, the rate was reduced to 1% per annum.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 475, June.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jones-Bridge-skyview-with-Post-Office-1930s.jpg|thumb|1930s Manila overlooking the Pasig River and Manila Central Post Office]]\nThe policy with the most far reaching consequences of this period was the peg between the peso and dollar. This was enforced by law until 1975. It provided monetary stability for foreign investment inflows, which lead to 40% of all capital invested in manufacturing and commercial enterprises to be owned by foreign entities by 1938. On the other hand, this overvaluation of the peso would have a negative impact with foreign trade with the rest of Asia. Economic policy leading to independence would have necessitated loosening trade links with the US. In order to achieve an internationally competitive exchange rate, the peso dollar link would have to be broken. The much belated move to a true floating exchange rate led to uncompetitive exports as such an import substitution strategy remained until significant currency devaluation opened up the opportunity for reorienting towards exports.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 479, June.</ref>\n\n===Per capita GDP in 1990 Geary-Khamis dollars<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 477, June.</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! 1900 !! 1913 !! 1929 !! 1938 !! 1950 !! 1970 !! 1990\n|-\n| Burma || 647 || 635 || NA || 685 || 393 || 602 || 687\n|-\n| India || 625 || 663 || 665 || 619 || 597 || 878 || 1316\n|-\n| Indonesia || 745 || 917 || 1207 || 1136 || 916 || 1239 || 2525\n|-\n| Japan || 1135 || 1334 || 1949 || 2356 || 1873 || 9448 || 18548\n|-\n| Philippines || 1033 || 1418 || 1564 || 1497 || 1293 || 1766 || 2300\n|- \n| South Korea || 850 || 948 || 1164 || 1649 || 876 || 2208 || 8977\n|-\n| Taiwan || 759 || 794 || 1107 || 1320 || 922 || 2692 || 10324\n|-\n| Thailand || 812 || 846 || 799 || 832 || 882 || 1596 || 4173\n|}\n\n===Annual growth rate of GDP per capita in 1990 Geary-Khamis dollars<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 477, June.</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! 1900-13 !! 1913-29 !! 1929-38 !! 1938-50 !! 1950-70 !! 1970-90 \n|-\n| Burma || 1.19 || 2.42 || -0.45 || -3.65|| 4.12 || 2.82\n|-\n| India || 0.96 || 0.59 || 0.49 || 0.93 || 3.98 || 4.27\n|-\n| Indonesia || 2.79 || 2.85 || 0.77 || -0.40 || 3.34 || 5.73\n|-\n| Japan || 2.46 || 3.63 || 3.53 || -0.66 || 9.20 || 4.22\n|-\n| Philippines || 2.44 || 0.61 || -0.47 || -1.23 || 2.40 || 1.32\n|- \n| South Korea || 2.05 || 3.10 || 5.04 || -2.80 || 6.82 || 8.48\n|-\n| Taiwan ||  1.83 || 3.69 || 4.56 || -0.26 || 8.43 || 8.36\n|-\n| Thailand || 1.64 || 1.69 || 2.86 || 2.33 || 6.21 || 7.03\n|}\n\n=== World War II (1941\u201345) ===\n\nDue to the Japanese invasion establishing the unofficial [[Second Philippine Republic]], the economic growth receded and food shortages occurred. Prioritizing the shortages of food, Jose Laurel, the appointed President, organized an agency to distribute rice, even though most of the rice was confiscated by Japanese soldiers. Manila was one of the many places in the country that suffered from severe shortages, due mainly to a typhoon that struck the country in November 1943. The people were forced to cultivate private plots which produced root crops like [[kangkong]]. The Japanese, in order to raise rice production in the country, brought a quick-maturing horai rice, which was first used in Taiwan. Horai rice was expected to make the Philippines self-sufficient in rice by 1943, but rains during 1942 prevented this.\n\n[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|right|thumb|Japanese Invasion Money \u2013 Philippines 500 Pesos]]\nAlso during World War II in the Philippines, the occupying Japanese government issued fiat currency in several denominations; this is known as the [[Japanese government-issued Philippine peso|Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso]].\n\nThe first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"''replacement notes''\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"''bayong''\" (native bags made of woven coconut or ''[[Corypha|buri]]'' leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills.<ref name=kasaysayan>{{cite book|title=Kasaysayan: History of the Filipino People, Volume 7|year=1990|work=Reader's Digest}}</ref> In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 ''Mickey Mouse'' pesos.<ref>[[Teodoro Agoncillo|Agoncillo, Teodoro A.]] & Guerrero, Milagros C., ''History of the Filipino People'', 1986, R.P.

A year later in 1946, the Philippines got its independence in America, creating the [[Third Philippine Republic]].\n\nIn an effort to solve the massive socio-economic problems of the period, newly elected President [[Manuel Roxas]] reorganized the government, and proposed a wide-sweeping legislative program. Among the undertakings of the Third Republic's initial year were: The establishment of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (which would be reorganized in 1958 as the Development Bank of the Philippines);<ref>History of the Development Bank of the Philippines, About DBP accessed on 2 July 2015</ref> the creation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the organization of the foreign service through Executive Order No. 18; the GI Bill of Rights for Filipino veterans; and the revision of taxation laws to increase government revenues.<ref>''Blue Book of the First Year of the Republic'', Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1947, p. 27</ref>\n\nPresident Roxas moved to strengthen sovereignty by proposing a Central Bank for the Philippines to administer the Philippine banking system<ref>\"Creating a Central Bank for the Philippines\", Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, accessed on 2 July 2015</ref> which was established by Republic Act No. 265.\n\nIn leading a \"cash-starved<ref>Gleeck, Lewis, ''The Third Republic'', New Day Publishers, Quezon City,1993, p.47</ref> government\" that needed to attend a battered nation, President Roxas campaigned for the parity amendment to the 1935 Constitution. This amendment, demanded by the Philippine Trade Relations Act or the Bell Trade Act,<ref>Leclerc, Gr\u00e9goire and Hall, Charles A. S., ''Making World Development Work: Scientific Alternatives to Neoclassical Economic Theory'', (New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press, 2007)</ref> would give American citizens and industries the right to utilize the country's natural resources in return for rehabilitation support from the United States. The President, with the approval of Congress, proposed this move to the nation through a plebiscite.\n\nThe Roxas administration also pioneered the foreign policy of the Republic. Vice President Elpidio Quirino was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. General Carlos P. Romulo, as permanent representative<ref>Castro, Pacifico A., ''Diplomatic Agenda of the Philippine Presidents'', Foreign Service Institute, Manila, 1985, p. 1.</ref> of the Philippines to the United Nations, helped shape the country's international identity in the newly established stage for international diplomacy and relations. During the Roxas administration, the Philippines established diplomatic ties with foreign countries and gained membership to international entities, such as the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), etc.\n\nWhen President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] won the elections, his administration promoted the \"Filipino First\" policy, whose focal point was to regain economic independence; a national effort by Filipinos to \"obtain major and dominant participation in their economy.\"<ref>Carlos P. Garcia, \"Third State of the Nation Address,\" 25 January 1960, ''Official Gazette'', 25 January 1960, accessed on 2 July 2015,</ref> The administration campaigned for the citizens' support in patronizing Filipino products and services, and implemented import and currency controls favorable for Filipino industries.<ref>Abinales, Patricio N., Amoroso, Donna J., ''State and Society in the Philippines''.

Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2002., p. 227,</ref> The Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, through Republic Act No. 301, aimed to prevent corruption, and promote honesty and public trust. Another achievement of the Garcia administration was the Bohlen\u2013Serrano Agreement of 1959, which shortened the term of lease of the US military bases in the country from the previous 99 to 25 years.<ref>Cooley, Alexander, ''Base Politics: Dramatic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas'', NY: Cornell University Press, 2008, p. 68,</ref>\n\nPresident Diosdado Macapagal, during his inaugural address on 30 December 1961, emphasized the responsibilities and goals to be attained in the \"new era\" that was the Macapagal administration. He reiterated his resolve to eradicate corruption, and assured the public that honesty would prevail in his presidency. President Macapagal, too, aimed at self-sufficiency and the promotion of every citizen's welfare, through the partnership of the government and private sector, and to alleviate poverty by providing solutions for unemployment.\n\nAmong the laws passed during the Macapagal administration were: Republic Act No. 3844 or the Agricultural Land Reform Code (an act that established the Land Bank of the Philippines);<ref>\"History: Milestones in Corporate Existence\", Landbank web site, accessed on 2 July 2015,</ref> Republic Act No. 3466, which established the Emergency Employment Administration; Republic Act No. 3518, which established the Philippine Veterans Bank; Republic Act No. 3470, which established the National Cottage Industries Development Authority (NACIDA) to organize, revive, and promote the establishment of local cottage industries; and Republic Act No. 4156, which established the Philippine National Railways (PNR) to operate the national railroad and tramways. The administration lifted [[foreign exchange controls]] as part of the decontrol program in an attempt to promote national economic stability and growth.\n\n=== Marcos Era (1965\u201386) ===\n{{main|Economic history of the Philippines (1965\u201386)|Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos}}\nPresident Ferdinand E. Marcos declared [[martial law]] in the midst of rising student movements and an increasing number communist and socialist groups lobbying for reforms in their respective sectors. Leftists held rallies to express their frustrations to the government, this restiveness culminating in the [[First Quarter Storm]], where activists stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] only to be turned back by the [[Philippine Constabulary]].{{When|date=July 2012}} This event in particular left four people dead and many injured after heavy exchanges of gunfire. There was further unrest, and in the middle of the disorder on 21 September 1972, Marcos issued [[Proclamation No. 1081]], effectively installing martial law in the Philippines, a declaration that suspended civil rights and imposed military rule in the country.\n\nThe GDP of the Philippines rose during the [[martial law]], rising from P55 million to P193 million in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from commercial banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt.<ref name=\"multiple1\">{{cite book|last=De Dios|first=Emmanuel|title=An Analysis of the Philippine Economic Crisis|year=1984|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Diliman, Q.C.}}</ref> As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law was one of the heaviest borrowers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market. Much of the money was spent on pump-priming to improve infrastructure and promote [[tourism]]. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the [[Philippines]] lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970\u20131980, only registered an average 5.73 percent growth, while its counterparts like [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]] garnered a mean growth of 7.97 percent. This lag, which became very apparent at the end of the Marcos Regime, can be attributed to the failures of economic management that was brought upon by State-run monopolies, mismanaged exchange rates, imprudent monetary policy and debt management, all underpinned by rampant corruption and [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|cronyism]]. As said by Emannuel de Dios \u201c[\u2026]main characteristics distinguishing the Marcos years from other periods of our history has been the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the government, and the use of governmental functions to dispense economic privileges to some small factions in the private sector.\u201d<ref name=\"multiple1\" />\n\nThere are few more palpable and glaring examples of the economic mismanagement of the time than the [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]] (BNPP) located in [[Morong, Bataan]]. Started in the 1970s, the BNPP was supposed to boost the country's competitiveness by providing affordable electricity to fuel industrialization and job creation in the country. Far from this, the US$2.3 billion nuclear plant suffered from cost over-runs and engineering and structural issues which eventually led to its mothballing\u2014without generating a single watt of electricity.\n\n[[Income inequality]] grew during the era of martial law, as the poorest 60 percent of the nation were able to contribute only 22.5 percent of the income at 1980, down from 25.0 percent in 1970. The richest 10 percent, meanwhile, took a larger share of the income at 41.7 percent at 1980, up from 37.1 percent at 1970.<ref name=\"multiple1\" /> These trends coincided with accusations of [[cronyism]] in the Marcos administration, as the administration faced questions of favoring certain companies that were close to the ruling family.\n\nAccording to the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) conducted from 1965 to 1985, [[poverty]] incidence in the Philippines rose from 41 percent in 1965 to 58.9 percent in 1985. This can be attributed to lower real agricultural wages and lesser real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers. Real agricultural wages fell about 25 percent from their 1962 level, while real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers decreased by about one-third of their 1962 level. It was observed that higher labor force participation and higher incomes of the rich helped cushion the blow of the mentioned problems.{{How|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Aquino Administration (1986\u201392) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Corazon Aquino}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe Aquino administration took over an economy that had gone through socio-political disasters during the People Power revolution, where there was financial and commodity collapse caused by an overall consumer cynicism, a result of the propaganda against cronies, social economic unrest resulting from numerous global shortages, massive protests, lack of government transparency, the opposition's speculations, and various assassination attempts and failed coups. At that point in time, the country's incurred debt from the Marcos Era's debt-driven development began crippling the country, which slowly made the Philippines the \"Latin-American in East Asia\" as it started to experience the worst recession since the post-war era.\n\nMost of the immediate efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming the image of the country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive lay-offs and inflation. The Aquino administration was persistent in its belief that the problems that arose from the removal of the previous administration can be solved by the decentralization of power.\n\nGrowth gradually began in the next few years of the administration. Somehow, there was still a short-lived, patchy, and erratic recovery from 1987 to 1991 as the political situation stabilized a bit. With this, the peso became more competitive, confidence of investors was gradually regained, positive movements in terms of trade were realized, and regional growth gradually strengthened.\n\n=== Ramos Administration (1992\u201398) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Fidel Ramos}}\nThe Ramos administration basically served its role as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in \"hastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country\".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 106</ref> The administration was a proponent of [[capital account]] liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It was during the term of the administration when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was established, and the Philippines joined the [[World Trade Organization]] and other free trade associations such as the [[APEC]]. Also, debt reduction was considered and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called [[Brady Bonds]] also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, with Jose Almonte as one of the key adviser of the administration.\n\nBy the time Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already burdened with a heavy budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned the formation of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, on the part of the Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).\n\nThe daily brownouts that plagued the economy were also addressed through the enactment of policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy during the first year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.<ref>Canlas, p. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nThe economy seemed to be all set for long-run growth, as shown by sustainable and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, was that it was able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than anybody else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 57\u201359</ref>\n\nPerhaps some of the most important policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account Liberalization and the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The liberalization and opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992.<ref name=\"Balisacanand\">Balisacan and Hill, 'The Philippine Economy'', p. 21</ref> And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.\n\n=== Estrada Administration (1998\u20132001) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Joseph Estrada}}\nAlthough Estrada's administration had to endure the continued shocks of the Asian Crisis contagion, the administration was also characterized by the administration's economic mismanagement and \"midnight cabinets.\" As if the pro-poor rhetoric, promises and drama were not really appalling enough, the administration also had \"midnight cabinets composed of 'drinking buddies' influencing the decisions of the \"daytime cabinet'\".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 19</ref> [[Cronyism]] and other big issues caused the country's image of economic stability to change towards the worse. And instead of adjustments happening, further deterioration of the economy occurred. Targeted revenues were not reached, implementation of policies became very slow, and fiscal adjustments were not efficiently conceptualized and implemented. All those disasters caused by numerous mistakes were made worse by the sudden entrance of the ''[[Jueteng]]'' controversy, which gave rise to the succeeding EDSA Revolutions.\n\nDespite all these controversies, the administration still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise of the population policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped due to the fact that the church condemned it.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 299</ref> The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program \"Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development\".<ref>Villegas, p. 646\u2013647</ref> As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.\n\n=== Macapagal-Arroyo's Administration (2001\u201310) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo}}\nThe Arroyo administration, economically speaking, was a period of good growth rates simultaneous with the US, due perhaps to the emergence of the [[Overseas Filipino]] workers (OFW) and the [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). The emergence of the OFW and the BPO improved the contributions of OFW remittances and investments to growth. In 2004, however, fiscal deficits grew and grew as tax collections fell, perhaps due to rampant and wide scale [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] incidences. Fearing that a doomsday prophecy featuring the [Argentina default] in 2002 might come to fruition, perhaps due to the same sort of fiscal crisis, the administration pushed for the enactment of the 12% VAT and the E-VAT to increase tax revenue and address the large fiscal deficits. This boosted fiscal policy confidence and brought the economy back on track once again.\n\nSoon afterwards, political instability afflicted the country and the economy anew with [[Abu Sayyaf]] terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the major recession that the United States and the rest of the world were actually experiencing.\n\nThe important policies of the Arroyo administration highlighted the importance of regional development, tourism, and foreign investments into the country. Therefore, apart from the enactment and establishment of the E-VAT policy to address the worsening fiscal deficits, the administration also pushed for regional development studies in order to address certain regional issues such as disparities in regional per capita income and the effects of commercial communities on rural growth.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Dynamics'', p. 378</ref> The administration also advocated for investments to improve tourism, especially in other unexplored regions that actually need development touches as well. To further improve tourism, the administration launched the policy touching on Holiday Economics, which involves the changing of days in which we would celebrate certain holidays. Indeed, through the Holiday Economics approach, investments and tourism really improved. As for investment, the Arroyo administration would normally go through lots of trips to other countries in order to encourage foreign investments for the betterment of the Philippine economy and its development.\n\n=== Benigno Aquino III's Administration (2010\u201316) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Benigno Aquino III}}\n[[File:Philippine economic boom.png|thumb|left|Philippine GDP growth 2000-2016]]\nThe Philippines consistently coined as one of the Newly Industrialized Countries has had a fair gain during the latter years under the Arroyo Presidency to the current administration. The government managed foreign debts falling from 58% in 2008 to 47% of total government borrowings. According to the 2012 World Wealth Report, the Philippines was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2010 with a GDP growth of 7.3% driven by the growing business process outsourcing and overseas remittances.<ref name=PHGrowth>{{cite news |title=Philippines, 6th fastest growing in the world: wealth report|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/10928-ph-to-post-high-growth-until-2050 |work=Rappler |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe country markedly slipped to 3.6% in 2011 after the government placed less emphasis on exports, as well as spending less on infrastructure. In addition, the disruption of the flow of imports for raw materials as a result from floods in Thailand and the tsunami in Japan have affected the manufacturing sector in the same year. \"The Philippines contributed more than $125 million as of end-2011 to the pool of money disbursed by the International Monetary Fund to help address the financial crisis confronting economies in Europe. This was according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reported Tuesday that the Philippines, which enjoys growing foreign exchange reserves, has made available about $251.5 million to the IMF to finance the assistance program\u2014the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP)\u2014for crisis-stricken countries.\"<ref name=PHLeander>{{cite news |title=Philippines contributed $125M to IMF as of end-'11 |url=http://business.inquirer.net/45725/philippines-contributed-125m-to-imf-as-of-end-%E2%80%9911|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2012. The Philippine Stock Exchange index ended 2012 with 5,812.73 points a 32.95% growth from the 4,371.96-finish in 2011.<ref name=TheGlobalEconomy.com>{{cite news |title=Philippines: Economic growth |url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Philippines/Economic_growth/ |publisher=TheGlobalEconomy.com |date=2017 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Macroeconomic trends==\n{{See also| Economy of Asia|Economic history of the Philippines (1973\u20131986)|Post-EDSA macroeconomic history of the Philippines|Economic Crisis and Response in the Philippines}}\n[[File:Historical GDP growth of the Philippines.png|thumb|300px|Historical growth of the Philippine economy from 1961-2015]]\nThe Philippine economy has been growing steadily over decades and the International Monetary Fund in 2014 reported it as the 39th largest economy in the world. However its growth has been behind that of many of its Asian neighbors, the so-called [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], and it is not a part of the [[Group of 20]] nations. Instead it is grouped in a second tier for [[emerging markets]] or [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]].

Philippine gold, nickel, copper, palladium and chromite deposits are among the largest in the world. Other important minerals include silver, coal, gypsum, and sulphur. Significant deposits of clay, limestone, marble, silica, and phosphate exist.\n\nAbout 60% of total mining production are accounted for by non-metallic minerals, which contributed substantially to the industry's steady output growth between 1993 and 1998, with the value of production growing 58%. In 1999, however, mineral production declined 16% to $793 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Mineral exports have generally slowed since 1996. Led by copper cathodes, Philippine mineral exports amounted to $650 million in 2000, barely up from 1999 levels. Low metal prices, high production costs, lack of investment in infrastructure, and a challenge to the new mining law have contributed to the mining\nindustry's overall decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe industry rebounded starting in late 2004 when the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of an important law permitting foreign ownership of Philippines mining companies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  However, the DENR has yet to approve the revised Department Administrative Order (DAO) that will provide the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA), the specific part of the 1994 Mining Act that allows 100% foreign ownership of Philippines mines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Offshoring and outsourcing===\n{{Main| Business process outsourcing in the Philippines|Call center industry in the Philippines}}\n[[File:Teletech call cent BACOLOD.jpg|thumb|A business process outsourcing office in [[Bacolod]]]]\n\nIn 2008, the [[Philippines]] has surpassed [[India]] as the world leader in [[business process outsourcing]].<ref>IBM Global Business Services.

The country which was then composed of different kingdoms and thalassocracies oversaw the large number of merchants coming to the islands for trade. [[Indian people|Indian]], [[Arabian people|Arab]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] merchants were welcomed by these kingdoms, which were mostly located by riverbanks, coastal ports and central plains. The merchants traded for goods such as gold, rice, pots and other products. The [[barter system]] was implemented at that time and the pre-colonial people enjoyed a life filled with imported goods which reflected their fashion and lifestyle.\n\nFrom the 12th century, a huge industry centred around the manufacture and trade of burnay clay pots, used for the storage of tea and other perishables, was set up in the northern Philippines with Japanese and Okinawan traders. These pots were known as 'Ruson-tsukuri' (Luzon-made) in Japanese, and were considered among the best storage vessels used for the purpose of keeping tea leaves and rice wine fresh. Hence, Ruson-Tsukuri pots became sought after in Northeast Asia. Each Philippine kiln had its own branding symbol, marked on the bottom of the Ruson-tsukuri by a single [[baybayin]] letter.\n\nThe people also were great agriculturists and the islands especifically [[Luzon]] has great abundance of rice, fowls, wine as well as great numbers of carabaos, deer, wild boar and goats. In addition, there were also great quantities of cotton and colored clothes, wax, honey and date palms produced by the natives. The precolonial state of [[Caboloan]]  in [[Pangasinan]] often exported deer-skins to [[Japan]] and [[Okinawa]]. The Nation of [[Ma-i]] produced beeswax, cotton, true pearls, tortoise shell, medicinal betel nuts and yuta cloth in their trade with East Asia. By the early sixteenth century, the two largest polities of the [[List of islands in the Greater Manila Area|Pasig River delta]], [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], established a shared monopoly on the trade of Chinese goods throughout the rest of the Philippine archipelago.<ref name=\"Dery2001\">{{cite book | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | authorlink =  | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | year = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | pages =  | volume =  | edition =  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-971-10-1069-0  }}</ref>\n\nThe Visayas islands which is home to the [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]], the Kedatuan of Dapitan and the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] on the other hand were abundant in rice, fish, cotton, swine, fowls, wax and honey. [[Leyte]] was said to produce two rice crops a year, and Pedro Chirino commented on the great rice and cotton harvests that were sufficient to feed and clothe the people.\n\nIn Mindanao, the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] specialized in the mining of gold and the manufacture of jewelry. The [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] was known for the raising and harvesting of [[cinnamon]]. The [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Sultanate of Lanao]] had a fishing industry by lake Lanao and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] had lively pearl-diving operations.\n\nThe kingdoms of ancient Philippines were active in international trade, and they used the ocean as natural highways.<ref name=\"great\">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html From the mountains to the seas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521091413/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/jan/18/yehey/weekend/20090118week1.html |date=21 May 2009 }}.

The natives make use of the ''salambao'', which is a type of raft that utilizes a large [[fishing net]] which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles made from a particular type of resin similar to the copal of Mexico. Use of safe pens for incubation and protection of the small fry from predators was also observed, and this method astonished the Spaniards at that time.<ref name=\"geo\" /> During fishing, large mesh nets were also used by the natives to protect the young and ensure future good catches.\n\nFrom the early 1500s to as late as the 1560s, people from [[Luzon]], Philippines; were referred to in Portuguese Malacca as [[Lu\u00e7\u00f5es]], and they set up many overseas communities across Southeast Asia where they participated in trading ventures and military campaigns in [[Taungoo Dynasty|Burma]], [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] and [[East Timor|Eastern Timor]]<ref>Lucoes warriors aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547&nbsp;AD.

The arrival of the Spanish removed this slavering system. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi with Tlaxcaltecs from Mexico conquered and unified the islands. The conquered was possible thanks to the discovery of the trip back to Mexico coast by Agustino Urdaneta. The administration of Islas Filipinas was done through the Capitania General and depended on Mexico Capital which formed the New Spain Viceroyalty. The economy of Islas Filipinas grew further when the Spanish government inaugurated the [[Manila Galleon]] trade system.

Trade also introduced foodstuffs such as [[maize]], [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[chili pepper]]s, [[chocolate]] and [[pineapple]]s from [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. [[Tobacco]], first domesticated in Latin-America, and then introduced to the Philippines, became an important cash crop for Filipinos. The Philippines also became the distribution center of silver mined in the Americas, which was in high demand in Asia, during the period.<ref>1996. \u201cSilk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century.\u201d Philippine Studies 44, 1:52-68.</ref> In exchange for this silver, Manila gathered Indonesian spices, Chinese silks and Indian gems to be exported to Mexico.<ref>Chuan, Hang-sheng. 2001. \u201cThe Chinese Silk Trade with Spanish-America from the Late Ming Period to the Mid-Ch\u2019ing Period.\u201d In Studia Asiatica Essays in Asian Studies in Felicitation to the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of Professor Ch\u2019en Shouyi, ed.

Nevertheless, it didn't affect the economy of the islands.\n\nOn 10 March 1785, [[King Charles III of Spain]] confirmed the establishment of the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter. The Basque-based company was granted a monopoly on the importation of Chinese and Indian goods into the Philippines, as well as the shipping of the goods directly to Spain via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eang|first=Cheong Weng|date=1970|title=Changing the Rules of the Game (The India-Manila Trade: 1785\u20131809)1|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/changing-the-rules-of-the-game-the-indiamanila-trade-178518091/DFED0589509EC155F2EC9C91A201D637|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1017/S002246340002021X|issn=1474-0680|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Spanish East Indies (1815\u201398) ===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 150\n| image1 = La Yndia del Campo tiendera by Justiniano Asuncion.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''La Yndia del Campo tiendera'' (A Native Filipina Rural Merchant) by [[Justiniano Asuncion]])\n| image2 = La Yndia del Campo Tendedora by Justiniano Asuncion.jpg\n| caption2 = ''La Yndia del Campo Tendedora'' (A Native Filipina Field Tender / Farmer) by [[Justiniano Asuncion]]\n}}\n[[File:Escolta Manila.jpg|thumb|200px|Calle Escolta, the economic center of 19th-century Manila]]\n[[File:PHI-A8-El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino-10 pesos (1896).jpg|thumb|150px|El Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino, 10 pesos bank note (1896)]]\nAfter Spain lost Mexico as a territory, New Spain was dissolved making the Philippines and other Pacific islands to form the [[Spanish East Indies]]. This resulted in the Philippines being governed directly by the [[King of Spain]] and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] while the Pacific islands of [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Guam]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Palau]] was governed by the [[Real Audiencia of Manila]] and was part of the Philippine territorial governance.\n\nIt made the economy of the Philippines grow further as people saw the rise of opportunities. Agriculture remained the largest contributor to economy, being the largest producer of [[coffee]] in Asia as well as a large produce of [[tobacco]].\n\nIn [[Europe]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread from [[Great Britain]] during the period known as the [[Victorian Age]]. The industrialization of Europe created great demands for raw materials from the colonies, bringing with it investment and wealth, although this was very unevenly distributed. [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas|Governor-General Basco]] had opened the Philippines to this trade. Previously, the Philippines was seen as a trading post for international trade but in the nineteenth century it was developed both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods. The economy of the Philippines rose rapidly and its local industries developed to satisfy the rising demands of an industrializing Europe. A small flow of European immigrants came with the opening of the Suez Canal, which cut the travel time between Europe and the Philippines by half. New ideas about government and society, which the friars and colonial authorities found dangerous, quickly found their way into the Philippines, notably through the Freemasons, who along with others, spread the ideals of the American, French and other revolutions, including Spanish liberalism.\n\nIn 1834 the Royal Company of the Philippines was abolished, and free trade was formally recognized. With its excellent harbor, Manila became an open port for Asian, European, and North American traders. European merchants alongside the Chinese immigrants opened stores selling goods from all parts of the world. The ''El Banco Espa\u00f1ol Filipino de Isabel II ''(now the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]]) was the first bank opened in the Philippines in 1851.\n\nIn 1873 additional ports were opened to foreign commerce, and by the late nineteenth century three crops\u2014tobacco, abaca, and sugar\u2014dominated Philippine exports.\n\n== First Philippine Republic (1899\u20131901) ==\n\nThe economy of the Philippines during the insurgency of the [[First Philippine Republic]] remained the same throughout its early years but was halted due to the break out of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Nevertheless, during the era of the First Republic, the estimated [[GDP per capita]] for the Philippines in 1900 was of $1,033.00. That made it the second richest place in all of Asia, just a little behind Japan ($1,135.00), and far ahead of China ($652.00) or India ($625.00).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_gdp_per_cap_in_190-economy-gdp-per-capita-1900|title=GDP per capita in 1900 by country.

An initial high growth phase occurred during the 1910s due to the recovery from the wars with Spain and the US, and investment in agriculture. The Philippines would at first briefly outpace its neighbors. This would not last as growth fell behind in the later years. Stagnation in the late 1920s and beyond took place as access to US markets became restricted by protectionist quotas and fiscal restraints forestalled any further development in agriculture.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 465, June.</ref> \n\nThe growth period can be attributed to the results of a crash program in agricultural modernization undertaken in 1910\u20131920. This in turn was done in order to address the growing shortfall in the supply of rice. The Philippines once a net exporter became an importer of rice as a result of the wars with the Spanish and later the Americans and by the reallocation of labour to export crops.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 467, June.</ref>\n\nThe 1930s would mark the end to this period of relative prosperity. The Sugar Act of 1934 capped Philippines sugar exports to the US at 921,000 tons per year. Expenditure on public infrastructure for agriculture was reduced as the Payne\u2013Aldridge Act stripped the government of customs revenue. Manila hemp was now competing against the newly invented [[Nylon]]. Although the area of land cultivated for agriculture was still increasing, the rate was reduced to 1% per annum.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 475, June.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jones-Bridge-skyview-with-Post-Office-1930s.jpg|thumb|1930s Manila overlooking the Pasig River and Manila Central Post Office]]\nThe policy with the most far reaching consequences of this period was the peg between the peso and dollar. This was enforced by law until 1975. It provided monetary stability for foreign investment inflows, which lead to 40% of all capital invested in manufacturing and commercial enterprises to be owned by foreign entities by 1938. On the other hand, this overvaluation of the peso would have a negative impact with foreign trade with the rest of Asia. Economic policy leading to independence would have necessitated loosening trade links with the US. In order to achieve an internationally competitive exchange rate, the peso dollar link would have to be broken. The much belated move to a true floating exchange rate led to uncompetitive exports as such an import substitution strategy remained until significant currency devaluation opened up the opportunity for reorienting towards exports.<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 479, June.</ref>\n\n===Per capita GDP in 1990 Geary-Khamis dollars<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 477, June.</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! 1900 !! 1913 !! 1929 !! 1938 !! 1950 !! 1970 !! 1990\n|-\n| Burma || 647 || 635 || NA || 685 || 393 || 602 || 687\n|-\n| India || 625 || 663 || 665 || 619 || 597 || 878 || 1316\n|-\n| Indonesia || 745 || 917 || 1207 || 1136 || 916 || 1239 || 2525\n|-\n| Japan || 1135 || 1334 || 1949 || 2356 || 1873 || 9448 || 18548\n|-\n| Philippines || 1033 || 1418 || 1564 || 1497 || 1293 || 1766 || 2300\n|- \n| South Korea || 850 || 948 || 1164 || 1649 || 876 || 2208 || 8977\n|-\n| Taiwan || 759 || 794 || 1107 || 1320 || 922 || 2692 || 10324\n|-\n| Thailand || 812 || 846 || 799 || 832 || 882 || 1596 || 4173\n|}\n\n===Annual growth rate of GDP per capita in 1990 Geary-Khamis dollars<ref>Hooley, Richard, 2005. \"American economic policy in the Philippines, 1902-1940: Exploring a dark age in colonial statistics,\" Journal of Asian Economics, Elsevier, vol. 16(3), page 477, June.</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! 1900-13 !! 1913-29 !! 1929-38 !! 1938-50 !! 1950-70 !! 1970-90 \n|-\n| Burma || 1.19 || 2.42 || -0.45 || -3.65|| 4.12 || 2.82\n|-\n| India || 0.96 || 0.59 || 0.49 || 0.93 || 3.98 || 4.27\n|-\n| Indonesia || 2.79 || 2.85 || 0.77 || -0.40 || 3.34 || 5.73\n|-\n| Japan || 2.46 || 3.63 || 3.53 || -0.66 || 9.20 || 4.22\n|-\n| Philippines || 2.44 || 0.61 || -0.47 || -1.23 || 2.40 || 1.32\n|- \n| South Korea || 2.05 || 3.10 || 5.04 || -2.80 || 6.82 || 8.48\n|-\n| Taiwan ||  1.83 || 3.69 || 4.56 || -0.26 || 8.43 || 8.36\n|-\n| Thailand || 1.64 || 1.69 || 2.86 || 2.33 || 6.21 || 7.03\n|}\n\n=== World War II (1941\u201345) ===\n\nDue to the Japanese invasion establishing the unofficial [[Second Philippine Republic]], the economic growth receded and food shortages occurred. Prioritizing the shortages of food, Jose Laurel, the appointed President, organized an agency to distribute rice, even though most of the rice was confiscated by Japanese soldiers. Manila was one of the many places in the country that suffered from severe shortages, due mainly to a typhoon that struck the country in November 1943. The people were forced to cultivate private plots which produced root crops like [[kangkong]]. The Japanese, in order to raise rice production in the country, brought a quick-maturing horai rice, which was first used in Taiwan. Horai rice was expected to make the Philippines self-sufficient in rice by 1943, but rains during 1942 prevented this.\n\n[[File:PHI-114-Japanese Government (Philippines)-500 Pesos (1944).jpg|right|thumb|Japanese Invasion Money \u2013 Philippines 500 Pesos]]\nAlso during World War II in the Philippines, the occupying Japanese government issued fiat currency in several denominations; this is known as the [[Japanese government-issued Philippine peso|Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso]].\n\nThe first issue in 1942 consisted of denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 centavos and 1, 5, and 10 Pesos. The next year brought \"''replacement notes''\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation.

A year later in 1946, the Philippines got its independence in America, creating the [[Third Philippine Republic]].\n\nIn an effort to solve the massive socio-economic problems of the period, newly elected President [[Manuel Roxas]] reorganized the government, and proposed a wide-sweeping legislative program. Among the undertakings of the Third Republic's initial year were: The establishment of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (which would be reorganized in 1958 as the Development Bank of the Philippines);<ref>History of the Development Bank of the Philippines, About DBP accessed on 2 July 2015</ref> the creation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the organization of the foreign service through Executive Order No. 18; the GI Bill of Rights for Filipino veterans; and the revision of taxation laws to increase government revenues.<ref>''Blue Book of the First Year of the Republic'', Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1947, p. 27</ref>\n\nPresident Roxas moved to strengthen sovereignty by proposing a Central Bank for the Philippines to administer the Philippine banking system<ref>\"Creating a Central Bank for the Philippines\", Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website, accessed on 2 July 2015</ref> which was established by Republic Act No. 265.\n\nIn leading a \"cash-starved<ref>Gleeck, Lewis, ''The Third Republic'', New Day Publishers, Quezon City,1993, p.47</ref> government\" that needed to attend a battered nation, President Roxas campaigned for the parity amendment to the 1935 Constitution. This amendment, demanded by the Philippine Trade Relations Act or the Bell Trade Act,<ref>Leclerc, Gr\u00e9goire and Hall, Charles A. S., ''Making World Development Work: Scientific Alternatives to Neoclassical Economic Theory'', (New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press, 2007)</ref> would give American citizens and industries the right to utilize the country's natural resources in return for rehabilitation support from the United States. The President, with the approval of Congress, proposed this move to the nation through a plebiscite.\n\nThe Roxas administration also pioneered the foreign policy of the Republic. Vice President Elpidio Quirino was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. General Carlos P. Romulo, as permanent representative<ref>Castro, Pacifico A., ''Diplomatic Agenda of the Philippine Presidents'', Foreign Service Institute, Manila, 1985, p. 1.</ref> of the Philippines to the United Nations, helped shape the country's international identity in the newly established stage for international diplomacy and relations. During the Roxas administration, the Philippines established diplomatic ties with foreign countries and gained membership to international entities, such as the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), etc.\n\nWhen President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] won the elections, his administration promoted the \"Filipino First\" policy, whose focal point was to regain economic independence; a national effort by Filipinos to \"obtain major and dominant participation in their economy.\"<ref>Carlos P. Garcia, \"Third State of the Nation Address,\" 25 January 1960, ''Official Gazette'', 25 January 1960, accessed on 2 July 2015,</ref> The administration campaigned for the citizens' support in patronizing Filipino products and services, and implemented import and currency controls favorable for Filipino industries.<ref>Abinales, Patricio N., Amoroso, Donna J., ''State and Society in the Philippines''.

President Macapagal, too, aimed at self-sufficiency and the promotion of every citizen's welfare, through the partnership of the government and private sector, and to alleviate poverty by providing solutions for unemployment.\n\nAmong the laws passed during the Macapagal administration were: Republic Act No. 3844 or the Agricultural Land Reform Code (an act that established the Land Bank of the Philippines);<ref>\"History: Milestones in Corporate Existence\", Landbank web site, accessed on 2 July 2015,</ref> Republic Act No. 3466, which established the Emergency Employment Administration; Republic Act No. 3518, which established the Philippine Veterans Bank; Republic Act No. 3470, which established the National Cottage Industries Development Authority (NACIDA) to organize, revive, and promote the establishment of local cottage industries; and Republic Act No. 4156, which established the Philippine National Railways (PNR) to operate the national railroad and tramways. The administration lifted [[foreign exchange controls]] as part of the decontrol program in an attempt to promote national economic stability and growth.\n\n=== Marcos Era (1965\u201386) ===\n{{main|Economic history of the Philippines (1965\u201386)|Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos}}\nPresident Ferdinand E. Marcos declared [[martial law]] in the midst of rising student movements and an increasing number communist and socialist groups lobbying for reforms in their respective sectors. Leftists held rallies to express their frustrations to the government, this restiveness culminating in the [[First Quarter Storm]], where activists stormed [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] only to be turned back by the [[Philippine Constabulary]].{{When|date=July 2012}} This event in particular left four people dead and many injured after heavy exchanges of gunfire. There was further unrest, and in the middle of the disorder on 21 September 1972, Marcos issued [[Proclamation No. 1081]], effectively installing martial law in the Philippines, a declaration that suspended civil rights and imposed military rule in the country.\n\nThe GDP of the Philippines rose during the [[martial law]], rising from P55 million to P193 million in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from commercial banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt.<ref name=\"multiple1\">{{cite book|last=De Dios|first=Emmanuel|title=An Analysis of the Philippine Economic Crisis|year=1984|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Diliman, Q.C.}}</ref> As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law was one of the heaviest borrowers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market. Much of the money was spent on pump-priming to improve infrastructure and promote [[tourism]]. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the [[Philippines]] lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970\u20131980, only registered an average 5.73 percent growth, while its counterparts like [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]] garnered a mean growth of 7.97 percent. This lag, which became very apparent at the end of the Marcos Regime, can be attributed to the failures of economic management that was brought upon by State-run monopolies, mismanaged exchange rates, imprudent monetary policy and debt management, all underpinned by rampant corruption and [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|cronyism]]. As said by Emannuel de Dios \u201c[\u2026]main characteristics distinguishing the Marcos years from other periods of our history has been the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the government, and the use of governmental functions to dispense economic privileges to some small factions in the private sector.\u201d<ref name=\"multiple1\" />\n\nThere are few more palpable and glaring examples of the economic mismanagement of the time than the [[Bataan Nuclear Power Plant]] (BNPP) located in [[Morong, Bataan]]. Started in the 1970s, the BNPP was supposed to boost the country's competitiveness by providing affordable electricity to fuel industrialization and job creation in the country. Far from this, the US$2.3 billion nuclear plant suffered from cost over-runs and engineering and structural issues which eventually led to its mothballing\u2014without generating a single watt of electricity.\n\n[[Income inequality]] grew during the era of martial law, as the poorest 60 percent of the nation were able to contribute only 22.5 percent of the income at 1980, down from 25.0 percent in 1970. The richest 10 percent, meanwhile, took a larger share of the income at 41.7 percent at 1980, up from 37.1 percent at 1970.<ref name=\"multiple1\" /> These trends coincided with accusations of [[cronyism]] in the Marcos administration, as the administration faced questions of favoring certain companies that were close to the ruling family.\n\nAccording to the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) conducted from 1965 to 1985, [[poverty]] incidence in the Philippines rose from 41 percent in 1965 to 58.9 percent in 1985. This can be attributed to lower real agricultural wages and lesser real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers. Real agricultural wages fell about 25 percent from their 1962 level, while real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers decreased by about one-third of their 1962 level. It was observed that higher labor force participation and higher incomes of the rich helped cushion the blow of the mentioned problems.{{How|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Aquino Administration (1986\u201392) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Corazon Aquino}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe Aquino administration took over an economy that had gone through socio-political disasters during the People Power revolution, where there was financial and commodity collapse caused by an overall consumer cynicism, a result of the propaganda against cronies, social economic unrest resulting from numerous global shortages, massive protests, lack of government transparency, the opposition's speculations, and various assassination attempts and failed coups. At that point in time, the country's incurred debt from the Marcos Era's debt-driven development began crippling the country, which slowly made the Philippines the \"Latin-American in East Asia\" as it started to experience the worst recession since the post-war era.\n\nMost of the immediate efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming the image of the country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive lay-offs and inflation. The Aquino administration was persistent in its belief that the problems that arose from the removal of the previous administration can be solved by the decentralization of power.\n\nGrowth gradually began in the next few years of the administration. Somehow, there was still a short-lived, patchy, and erratic recovery from 1987 to 1991 as the political situation stabilized a bit. With this, the peso became more competitive, confidence of investors was gradually regained, positive movements in terms of trade were realized, and regional growth gradually strengthened.\n\n=== Ramos Administration (1992\u201398) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Fidel Ramos}}\nThe Ramos administration basically served its role as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in \"hastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country\".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 106</ref> The administration was a proponent of [[capital account]] liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It was during the term of the administration when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was established, and the Philippines joined the [[World Trade Organization]] and other free trade associations such as the [[APEC]]. Also, debt reduction was considered and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called [[Brady Bonds]] also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, with Jose Almonte as one of the key adviser of the administration.\n\nBy the time Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already burdened with a heavy budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned the formation of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, on the part of the Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).\n\nThe daily brownouts that plagued the economy were also addressed through the enactment of policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy during the first year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.<ref>Canlas, p. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nThe economy seemed to be all set for long-run growth, as shown by sustainable and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, was that it was able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than anybody else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 57\u201359</ref>\n\nPerhaps some of the most important policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account Liberalization and the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The liberalization and opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992.<ref name=\"Balisacanand\">Balisacan and Hill, 'The Philippine Economy'', p. 21</ref> And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.\n\n=== Estrada Administration (1998\u20132001) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Joseph Estrada}}\nAlthough Estrada's administration had to endure the continued shocks of the Asian Crisis contagion, the administration was also characterized by the administration's economic mismanagement and \"midnight cabinets.\" As if the pro-poor rhetoric, promises and drama were not really appalling enough, the administration also had \"midnight cabinets composed of 'drinking buddies' influencing the decisions of the \"daytime cabinet'\".<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 19</ref> [[Cronyism]] and other big issues caused the country's image of economic stability to change towards the worse. And instead of adjustments happening, further deterioration of the economy occurred. Targeted revenues were not reached, implementation of policies became very slow, and fiscal adjustments were not efficiently conceptualized and implemented. All those disasters caused by numerous mistakes were made worse by the sudden entrance of the ''[[Jueteng]]'' controversy, which gave rise to the succeeding EDSA Revolutions.\n\nDespite all these controversies, the administration still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise of the population policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped due to the fact that the church condemned it.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Philippine Economy'', p. 299</ref> The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program \"Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development\".<ref>Villegas, p. 646\u2013647</ref> As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.\n\n=== Macapagal-Arroyo's Administration (2001\u201310) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo}}\nThe Arroyo administration, economically speaking, was a period of good growth rates simultaneous with the US, due perhaps to the emergence of the [[Overseas Filipino]] workers (OFW) and the [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). The emergence of the OFW and the BPO improved the contributions of OFW remittances and investments to growth. In 2004, however, fiscal deficits grew and grew as tax collections fell, perhaps due to rampant and wide scale [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] incidences. Fearing that a doomsday prophecy featuring the [Argentina default] in 2002 might come to fruition, perhaps due to the same sort of fiscal crisis, the administration pushed for the enactment of the 12% VAT and the E-VAT to increase tax revenue and address the large fiscal deficits. This boosted fiscal policy confidence and brought the economy back on track once again.\n\nSoon afterwards, political instability afflicted the country and the economy anew with [[Abu Sayyaf]] terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the major recession that the United States and the rest of the world were actually experiencing.\n\nThe important policies of the Arroyo administration highlighted the importance of regional development, tourism, and foreign investments into the country. Therefore, apart from the enactment and establishment of the E-VAT policy to address the worsening fiscal deficits, the administration also pushed for regional development studies in order to address certain regional issues such as disparities in regional per capita income and the effects of commercial communities on rural growth.<ref>Balisacan and Hill, ''The Dynamics'', p. 378</ref> The administration also advocated for investments to improve tourism, especially in other unexplored regions that actually need development touches as well. To further improve tourism, the administration launched the policy touching on Holiday Economics, which involves the changing of days in which we would celebrate certain holidays. Indeed, through the Holiday Economics approach, investments and tourism really improved. As for investment, the Arroyo administration would normally go through lots of trips to other countries in order to encourage foreign investments for the betterment of the Philippine economy and its development.\n\n=== Benigno Aquino III's Administration (2010\u201316) ===\n{{main|Presidency of Benigno Aquino III}}\n[[File:Philippine economic boom.png|thumb|left|Philippine GDP growth 2000-2016]]\nThe Philippines consistently coined as one of the Newly Industrialized Countries has had a fair gain during the latter years under the Arroyo Presidency to the current administration. The government managed foreign debts falling from 58% in 2008 to 47% of total government borrowings. According to the 2012 World Wealth Report, the Philippines was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2010 with a GDP growth of 7.3% driven by the growing business process outsourcing and overseas remittances.<ref name=PHGrowth>{{cite news |title=Philippines, 6th fastest growing in the world: wealth report|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/10928-ph-to-post-high-growth-until-2050 |work=Rappler |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe country markedly slipped to 3.6% in 2011 after the government placed less emphasis on exports, as well as spending less on infrastructure. In addition, the disruption of the flow of imports for raw materials as a result from floods in Thailand and the tsunami in Japan have affected the manufacturing sector in the same year. \"The Philippines contributed more than $125 million as of end-2011 to the pool of money disbursed by the International Monetary Fund to help address the financial crisis confronting economies in Europe. This was according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reported Tuesday that the Philippines, which enjoys growing foreign exchange reserves, has made available about $251.5 million to the IMF to finance the assistance program\u2014the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP)\u2014for crisis-stricken countries.\"<ref name=PHLeander>{{cite news |title=Philippines contributed $125M to IMF as of end-'11 |url=http://business.inquirer.net/45725/philippines-contributed-125m-to-imf-as-of-end-%E2%80%9911|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=22 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2012. The Philippine Stock Exchange index ended 2012 with 5,812.73 points a 32.95% growth from the 4,371.96-finish in 2011.<ref name=TheGlobalEconomy.com>{{cite news |title=Philippines: Economic growth |url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Philippines/Economic_growth/ |publisher=TheGlobalEconomy.com |date=2017 |accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Macroeconomic trends==\n{{See also| Economy of Asia|Economic history of the Philippines (1973\u20131986)|Post-EDSA macroeconomic history of the Philippines|Economic Crisis and Response in the Philippines}}\n[[File:Historical GDP growth of the Philippines.png|thumb|300px|Historical growth of the Philippine economy from 1961-2015]]\nThe Philippine economy has been growing steadily over decades and the International Monetary Fund in 2014 reported it as the 39th largest economy in the world. However its growth has been behind that of many of its Asian neighbors, the so-called [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]], and it is not a part of the [[Group of 20]] nations. Instead it is grouped in a second tier for [[emerging markets]] or [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]].

It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.\n\nThe development of a new [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'']] film began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the [[The Invisible Man|novel's]] plot, and the combination of scares with \"a smart narrative about how women can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\".<ref name=WrapProj/> The film also became a commercial success, grossing $125.8&nbsp;million worldwide against a $7&nbsp;million budget and it is currently the [[2020 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2020]]. However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available digitally-on-demand just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]] ([[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]]), Cecilia Kass ([[Elisabeth Moss]])\u00a0drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily ([[Harriet Dyer]]). After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend, Detective James Lanier ([[Aldis Hodge]]), and his teenage daughter Sydney ([[Storm Reid]]). Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5 million in his will handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom ([[Michael Dorman]]). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom\u00a0and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle before escaping to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disputes this, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight however, she silently taunts Adrian; having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit a free woman.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n* Benedict Hardie as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.

It is an international co-production of the United States and Australia.\n\nThe development of a new [[Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'']] film began as early as 2006. The project was revived as part of Universal's shared cinematic universe in 2016, intended to consist of their classic monsters, with [[Johnny Depp]] attached to star in the title role. After ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was released in 2017 to critical and financial failure, development was halted on all projects. In early 2019, the studio changed their plans from a serialized universe to films based on individualized story-telling, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from July to September 2019 in [[Sydney]], Australia.\n\n''The Invisible Man'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 28, 2020, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Moss' performance, its inventive modernization of the [[The Invisible Man|novel's]] plot, and the combination of scares with \"a smart narrative about how women can be manipulated and abused in harmful relationships\".<ref name=WrapProj/> The film also became a commercial success, grossing $125.8&nbsp;million worldwide against a $7&nbsp;million budget and it is currently the [[2020 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2020]]. However, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Universal announced the film would be made available digitally-on-demand just three weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n== Plot ==\nTrapped in a violent, controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]] ([[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]]), Cecilia Kass ([[Elisabeth Moss]])\u00a0drugs him with [[Diazepam]] and escapes their home into the nearby woods to wait for her sister, Emily ([[Harriet Dyer]]). After she arrives, Adrian nearly catches Cecilia, but the pair are able to escape.\n\nCecilia hides out with childhood friend, Detective James Lanier ([[Aldis Hodge]]), and his teenage daughter Sydney ([[Storm Reid]]). Two weeks later, Adrian seemingly commits [[suicide]] and leaves Cecilia $5 million in his will handled and organized by his lawyer brother, Tom ([[Michael Dorman]]). As Cecilia tries to move forward, she is plagued by several unexplained experiences. During a job interview, she faints after finding her portfolio's contents removed and is taken to the hospital. Later, the doctor calls and says they found high levels of Diazepam in her system. Shortly after returning home, Cecilia finds the same bottle she drugged Adrian with, which she dropped during her escape, in her bathroom.\n\nShe arranges a meeting with Tom,\u00a0and James, insisting that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but gets rebuffed. Cecilia turns to her sister, but Emily refuses to acknowledge her after receiving an email from Cecilia's account stating she never wants to see her again. Later, she is comforted by Sydney, but Sydney is hit by an unseen force, leading her and James to assume Cecilia did it. While a furious James rushes his daughter out of the house, Cecilia tries a number of tactics to catch the figure. After finding Adrian's old phone in the attic and covering the figure with paint, she ends up in a violent struggle and escapes to Adrian's home to investigate. In his lab, she finds a suit that confirms her suspicions. After hiding it in a closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so Cecilia flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet in a restaurant, though as Cecilia begins to tell her what she found, the invisible figure slits Emily's throat with a knife and places it in Cecilia's hand, framing her for the crime.\n\nRemanded to a [[mental hospital]] while she awaits trial, the staff informs Cecilia that she is pregnant. Tom visits her and offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to \"return to him\" and raise the child, implying that he helped his brother stage his suicide while revealing Adrian tampered with her [[birth control]] to ensure she became pregnant. Cecilia refuses to take the deal and steals a pen from his briefcase. That night, she uses the pen to pretend to commit suicide to draw the invisible figure out. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the invisible figure violently incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. Promising not to harm her because of her pregnancy, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves.\n\nCecilia races to James' house, where she finds the invisible figure attacking him and Sydney. She manages to shoot the figure after spraying him with a fire extinguisher, but when she unmasks him, she finds Tom in the suit. Police find a captive Adrian alive at his house, tied up in his basement and claiming Tom held him prisoner. Cecilia quickly disagrees, insisting the brothers must have shared the suit, with Adrian sending Tom to the house knowing what would happen.\n\nIn an attempt to get Adrian to confess, she meets him at his house to discuss her pregnancy while James listens in on a wire. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to being the invisible figure. Adrian insists Tom did kidnap him, claiming that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her in their relationship. When she begins to cry, Adrian alludes to former abuse using similar phrasing to that of the invisible figure. Smiling, Cecilia departs to use the restroom. Moments later, the room's security camera captures Adrian seemingly committing suicide. Cecilia returns and, apparently distraught, calls the police. Out of the camera's sight, however, she silently taunts Adrian, having retrieved the spare suit she hid earlier to kill him.\n\nWhen James arrives and asks what happened, she confirms what the camera saw. He spots the suit in her bag, but accepts her story and allows her to leave. Relieved, Cecilia leaves the house with the suit as a free woman.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Cecilia \"Cee\" Kass\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Adrian Griffin]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as James Lanier, a San Francisco police detective, Sydney's father and Cee\u2019s childhood friend\n* [[Storm Reid]] as Sydney Lanier, James' teenage daughter\n* [[Harriet Dyer]] as Emily Kass, Cee\u2019s sister\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Tom Griffin]], Adrian's brother and lawyer\n* Benedict Hardie as Marc\n* Amali Golden as Annie\n* Sam Smith as Detective Reckley\n* [[Nash Edgerton]] as a Security Guard\n* Zara Michaels as a Nurse\n* Vivienne Greer as Screaming Woman\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong]] as Accident Victim\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of a new ''The Invisible Man'' film began as early as 2006 when [[David S.

The organisation developed from a small community operation for local photographers and developed to encompass photographers Australia-wide and international in its program of exhibitions and publications. A major contribution was the survey exhibition and publication ''The Thousand Mile Stare'' which toured the nation through 1988 to 1989 which has become a reference point in the late twentieth history of Australian photography.<ref>Bennett, David & Agee, Joyce & Victorian Centre for Photography (1988).

It was supported by funding from the Victorian Ministry for the Arts and from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]] and issued an irregular newsletter to members. The organisation developed from a small community operation for local photographers and developed to encompass photographers Australia-wide and international in its program of exhibitions and publications. A major contribution was the survey exhibition and publication ''The Thousand Mile Stare'' which toured the nation through 1988 to 1989 which has become a reference point in the late twentieth history of Australian photography.<ref>Bennett, David & Agee, Joyce & Victorian Centre for Photography (1988).
