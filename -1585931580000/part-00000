He joined [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on loan in September 2014, before he was sold on to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in February 2015. He helped Shrewsbury to win promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2014\u201315 campaign, before he was loaned out to [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in January 2016. His contract with Shrewsbury was cancelled in August 2016, and he subsequently signed with [[AFC Wimbledon]].

The film stars [[Ross Lynch]] as Dahmer, and also stars [[Alex Wolff]], [[Dallas Roberts]], and [[Anne Heche]].\n\nThe film premiered at the 2017 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on November 3, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Gordon|title=Tribeca Film Festival Unveils 2017 Feature Film Slate (Full List)|url=https://variety.com/2017/legit/news/2017-tribeca-film-festival-slate-full-list-1202000457/|date=March 2, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1974, Jeffrey Dahmer is a high school freshman living in [[Bath, Ohio]], with his parents, Lionel and Joyce, and his little brother, Dave. Jeffrey develops an obsession with a male jogger whom he sees every day from his school bus. For a hobby, Jeffrey collects dead animals that he dissolves to the bones using chemicals provided by his father, who is a chemist. This hobby is initiated by his obsessive interest in how animals are \"fitted together\".<ref>{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=63}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Lionel trashes Jeffrey's collection of bones and orders him to make friends at school. During school, Jeffrey imitates spasms, clears his backpack, and makes loud noises, catching the attention of aspiring artist John \"Derf\" Backderf and his friends.  Jeffrey inspires Derf to draw him in various situations; drawings that would later be incorporated into Derf's graphic novel ''My Friend Dahmer''.  Derf and his friends form the \"Dahmer Fan Club,\" using Jeffrey for a variety of pranks such as sneaking him in every club yearbook photo, and conning their way to a meeting with then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]] during a school field trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Joyce starts relapsing into chronic [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], leading to increasingly bitter fights between her and Lionel. To cope, Jeffrey turns to [[Alcoholism|drinking heavily]], and begins killing animals himself.\n\nThe jogger with whom Jeffrey is obsessed turns out to be Dr. Matthews, the [[Pediatrics|physician]] of one of Derf's friends. Jeffrey fakes a cold so that he can get an appointment with him, and he can examine Jeffrey naked. Dr. Matthews becomes uncomfortable during the hernia exam when he notices that Jeffrey has an erection. When Jeffrey returns home, he retires to his room and masturbates to the incident. The following night, Jeffrey [[Necrophilia|fantasizes about being with Dr. Matthews' corpse]]. He starts stalking Dr. Matthews with a [[baseball bat]], but never goes through with attacking him.\n\nJeffrey's father moves out while Jeffrey is away on the field trip.  After the trip, Jeffrey makes some attempts to stay connected to his friends such as bringing a date to the prom, but ultimately drifts away from them. At graduation, Lionel hands Jeffrey the keys to the family [[Volkswagen Beetle]] which he would later use to commit his first murder. Unbeknownst to Lionel, Joyce leaves Ohio to live with relatives in Wisconsin, taking Dave with her and leaving Jeffrey completely alone.\n\nThat evening, Derf spots Jeffrey walking home alone, with blood on his fingernails. Derf offers a ride to Jeffrey, finding him living alone with no plans for the future.  Derf tells him that he is leaving for college the following day and offers him his drawings of Jeffrey, which he declines. He menacingly invites Derf inside for a beer, but Derf turns him down. As Derf walks back to his car, Jeffrey picks up a baseball bat and is about to strike him with it, although he later puts it down. As Derf gets in the car and drives home, he notices the bat. Jeffrey never has contact with his high school friends again. The next morning, Jeffrey drives around and picks up [[Hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] Steven Hicks from a concert.

They have released three [[live album]]s, ''[[We Are Young & Free]]'' (2013), ''[[Youth Revival]]'' (2016) and ''[[III Live at Hillsong Conference|III Live]]'' (2018) as well as four [[studio album]]s, ''[[Youth Revival Acoustic]]'' (2017), ''[[III (Hillsong Young & Free album)|III]]'' (2018), ''[[III (Studio Sessions)]]'' (2019), and ''[[III (Reimagined)]]'' (2019). Additionally, the group have released two [[extended play]]s, ''[[This Is Living EP|This Is Living]]'' (2015) and ''We Are Young & Free (The Remixes) - EP'' (2015).\n\n==Background==\nThe group formed in 2012 out of [[Sydney]], Australia, where they were located at Hillsong Church. Their members are worship leaders, Aodhan King, Alexander Pappas, Tyler Douglass, Renee Sieff, Ben Tan, and Melodie Wagner. [[Hillsong United]] [launched in 1998], the original group, began when the members were all relatively young, because it was started as part of the youth ministry at Hillsong Church. As they evolved and started to mature, have families of their own, and take on adulthood, many people at the church felt that there was a need for a new group that would aim its message at younger people with a stimulating new sound.<ref name=\"CR Story\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Mountford|title=Hillsong Young & Free: The latest offshoot of the Australian movement |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Hillsong_Young__Free_The_latest_offshoot_of_the_Australian_movement/52762/p1/|publisher=[[Cross Rhythms]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"AM Bio\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Jeffries|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BB Interview\">{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Askar|title=Hillsong Young & Free on New Live Album 'Youth Revival': 'The Focus Is on the Message' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6890367/hillsong-young-free-interview-youth-revival-album-interview|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"CCM Interview\">{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Ritchie |title=Hillsong Young & Free Q&A |url=https://www.ccmmagazine.com/features/hillsong-young-free-qa/ |magazine=[[CCM Magazine]] |accessdate=31 March 2016 |date=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHillsong Young & Free released their first [[live album]], ''We Are Young & Free'', on 1 October 2013.<ref name=\"AM Review\">{{cite web|first=Andree|last=Farias|title=''We Are Young & Free'' - Hillsong Young & Free : Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/we-are-young-free-live-mw0002562111|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review One\">{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Hathcock |title=Singing a Song to Fill the Void|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=21758&user_id=8571|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=1 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review One\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - We Are Young & Free |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=3953|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=6 September 2013}}</ref> The album debuted and peaked at No. 6 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] in Australia,<ref name=\"AUS\"/> also charting on several [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] charts in the United States, peaking at No. 22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 1 on the [[Christian Albums]] chart.<ref name=\"AM Awards\">{{cite web|author=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]|title=Hillsong Young & Free : Awards |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hillsong-young-free-mn0003139286/awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref> Their subsequent release an [[extended play]], ''This Is Living'', was released on 11 January 2015.<ref name=\"WL Review One\">{{cite web|first=Brendan|last=Prout|title=Hillsong Young & Free: ''This Is Living''|url=https://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|magazine=[[Worship Leader (magazine)|Worship Leader]]|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313210205/http://worshipleader.com/albums/this-is-living/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"NRT Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Caitlin|last=Lassiter|title=The Voice of A New Generation |url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/userprofile_reviewssinglepost.php?review_id=22814&user_id=130961|publisher=New Release Today|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=15 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"LTtM Review Two\">{{cite web|first=Jono|last=Davies|title=Reviews - Hillsong Young & Free - This Is Living |url=http://www.louderthanthemusic.com/document.php?id=4674|publisher=Louder Than the Music|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=21 January 2015}}</ref> The release charted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No. 38 and No. 1 on the Christian Albums chart.

They have released three [[live album]]s, ''[[We Are Young & Free]]'' (2013), ''[[Youth Revival]]'' (2016) and ''[[III Live at Hillsong Conference|III Live]]'' (2018) as well as four [[studio album]]s, ''[[Youth Revival Acoustic]]'' (2017), ''[[III (Hillsong Young & Free album)|III]]'' (2018), ''[[III (Studio Sessions)]]'' (2019), and ''[[III (Reimagined)]]'' (2019). Additionally, the group have released two [[extended play]]s, ''[[This Is Living EP|This Is Living]]'' (2015) and ''We Are Young & Free (The Remixes) - EP'' (2015).\n\n==Background==\nThe group formed in 2012 out of [[Sydney]], Australia, where they were located at Hillsong Church.
