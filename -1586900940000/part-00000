Originally published in ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'', it was written in England.  The story's protagonist is a Texas marshal named Jack Potter, who is returning to the town of Yellow Sky with his eastern bride.  Potter's nemesis, the gunslinger Scratchy Wilson, drunkenly plans to accost the sheriff after he disembarks the train, but his dumb self decided to shot himself in the back on the head\n\nThe short story inspired a 1967 opera of the same name by [[Roger Nixon]], and the 1952 film ''[[Face to Face (1952 film)|Face to Face]]''.\n\n==Author==\nStephen Crane was an American author born on November 1, 1871 in Newark, New Jersey who passed away on June 5, 1900 from tuberculosis. At the time of his death he was living in Germany. According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"He is known for being a novelist, poet, and short-story writer, best known for his novels ''Maggie: A Girl of the Streets'' (1893) and ''The Red Badge of Courage'' (1895) and the short stories '[[The Open Boat]]', 'The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky', and 'The Blue Hotel'\".\n\n==Plot summary==\n===I===\nThe short story opens in a parlor car of a train traveling westward from San Antonio towards a late-nineteenth-century Texas town named Yellow Sky. In this section a couple of characters are introduced\u2014Jack Potter, and his bride.  Newly married in San Antonio, \"They were evidently very happy\".<ref>Crane p. 300</ref> \"The bride was not pretty, nor was she very young. She wore a dress of blue cashmere, with small reservations of velvet here and there, and with steel blue buttons abounding\".<ref>Crane p. 300.</ref> Jack Potter is then described briefly as the Marshal of Yellow Sky. He is \"...a man known, liked, and feared in his corner, a prominent person...\".<ref>Crane pp. 301-302</ref> Further into chapter one, Potter is getting more and more anxious while approaching his town. \"In San Antonio he was a man hidden in the dark. A knife to sever any friendly duty, any form, was easy to his hand in that remote city. But the hour of Yellow Sky\u2014the hour of daylight\u2014was approaching\".<ref>Crane p. 302</ref> The section ends with Potter and his wife stepping off the train and fleeing the scene.\n\n===II===\nSection two begins in the setting of a bar in Yellow Sky called the Weary Gentlemen saloon. It introduces a few more characters in the first couple sentences. \"One was a salesman, who talked a great deal and rapidly; three were Texans who did not care to talk at the time; and two were Mexican sheep-herders, who did not talk as a general practice in the Weary Gentlemen saloon\".<ref>Crane p. 303</ref> In the fourth paragraph a young man appears in the doorway of the saloon and says \"Scratchy Wilson's drunk, and has turned loose with both hands\".<ref>Crane p. 303</ref> The drummer isn't aware of who Scratchy Wilson is, but when the barkeeper closes the shutters and locks the door, the drummer begins asking the barkeeper questions. The barkeeper answers his questions by stating \"You see, this here Scratchy Wilson is a wonder with a gun\u2014a perfect wonder; and when he goes on the war trail, we hunt our holes\u2014naturally. He's about the last one of the old gang that used to hang out along the river here. He's a terror when he's drunk. When he's sober he's all right\u2014kind of simple\u2014wouldn't hurt a fly\u2014nicest fellow in town. But when he's drunk\u2014whoo!\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> The plot of the second section is to add some rising suspense for chapter three when Scratchy Wilson appears.\n\n===III===\nThis section is solely about Scratchy Wilson. \"A man in a maroon-colored flannel shirt\"<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> and childlike red and gold boots is walking up the main street of Yellow Sky carrying a revolver. He is yelling throughout the town with a voice \"that seemed to have no relation to the ordinary vocal strength of a man\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> This man is the drunk Scratchy Wilson, and he is in search of a fight. When Scratchy approaches the door to the saloon, he comes into contact with the bartender's dog. The dog starts to walk away from Scratchy, he yells at it, and it starts to sprint. He starts shooting at the dog, missing both times but forcing the dog to flee in a new direction. He now turns his attention to the saloon door and pounds on it with his revolver demanding to be served a drink. He becomes infuriated, no one is letting him in, so he stabs some paper to the door and shoots at it. While walking back down the main street, the name Jack Potter comes to Scratchy's mind. He goes to the house of his \"ancient antagonist\"<ref>Crane 306</ref> and demands he come out and fight, becoming more and more enraged that Sheriff Potter is not answering him.\n\n===IV===\nSheriff Jack Potter and his bride walk around the corner to his house. There, they come face to face with Scratchy Wilson; reloading his revolver. He sees the Sheriff, drops his gun and pulls a fresh one from his holster. Scratchy believes that Jack going to attack him from behind. Sheriff Potter informs Scratchy that he was unarmed and would not be fighting him tonight. Being from the old west where everyone carries a gun, Scratchy does not believe Jack has no gun with him. The Sheriff tells him that he does not have his weapon because he was just married in San Antonio. Scratchy, in disbelief, sees Jack's new wife standing next to him on the street and instantly breaks his rage. He sinks his head and walks away leaving the bride and groom in peace.\n\n==Characters==\n*Jack Potter: The marshal of Yellow Sky. \"A conscientious man who takes his job seriously- too seriously, perhaps. He assumes that the townsfolk consider his role central to their safe existence and that they will feel he has let them down when they learn that he has married\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref> \"Like Scratchy, Jack is a relic of a time passed, but his marriage marks his relinquishment of his mythic role as the solitary western marshal\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref>\n*Bride: \"Jack's wife is given no name, signifying for many critics her role as a faceless representative of the institution of marriage, just one of many vestiges of eastern civilization that have made their way to Yellow Sky\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref> \"... she displays a shyness, clumsiness, and lack of sophistication that is noted by the other travelers, who immediately recognize her lower-class status\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref> \"Crane uses a mock heroic style to describe the wife's fascinated horror on seeing the gun-toting Scratchy\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref> \n*Drummer: The drummer is seen in the Saloon along with a handful of other men drinking and carrying away. \"Like other characters in Crane's fiction, he is a sober and rational (though perhaps overly talkative) representative of the East and is innocent of frontier ways; he is surprised to learn that such anachronistic characters as Scratchy still exist. The drummer plays a practical role in the plot because he is an outsider who needs to be educated about Yellow Sky, thereby providing a reason to include an explanation of Scratchy's background and nature\".<ref>Howes p. 144</ref>\n*Scratchy Wilson: When researching, if you come across the definition of the word \"scratchy\" you will find that it's usually talking about a certain fabric but it basically means to cause discomfort by having a rough or itchy feel. In the story, Scratchy never really harms anyone. Yes, he does aim his gun and fire at dormant objects but he never truly hurts anyone, he just causes discomfort. \"Although he plays the part of an old-style frontier character, the truth is that his flannel shirt was made in an eastern factory and his boots are the same kind coveted by schoolboys\".<ref>Howes p. 143</ref> \"His role as the mythic western cowboy and rogue has changed, just as Jack's role has changed, but he has no new role to assume and thus particularly pathetic as he trudges away at the end of the story\".<ref>Howes p. 144</ref>\n*The Negro Waiters: Waiters in white suits working on the dining car of the train. They lead the newlywed couple through the dinner, while subtly condescending them.\n*Mexican Sheep-Herders: Patrons of the Weary Gentleman saloon. Leave out the back door of the saloon upon hearing of Scratchy Wilson's antics. \n*Young Man: A young male resident of Yellow Sky. Warns the town and patrons of the Weary Gentlemen.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe short story \"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is written to show the vast incline of society for the West.{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=What does \"incline\" mean in this context?}} Paul Sorrentino, a published essay writer, wrote about the correlation between the name Jack Potter and a political figure for Texas named Robert Potter. Robert Potter signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. \"In 1888 Archibald Clavering Gunter combined the exploits of various Potters from Texas in his enormously best selling novel ''Mr. Potter of Texas'', a romantic adventure about a Mr. Sampson Potter, the stereotypical rugged frontiersman with the cliched heart of gold, who had been a ranger, Congressman, cattleman, and sheriff\".<ref>Sorrentino p. 53</ref> \"By the time that Crane wrote 'The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky' in 1897 about a Texas marshal named Jack Potter, the names Potter and Texas Jack were legendary symbols of the self-made frontiersman who helped pave the west for the advance of civilization. From Scratchy Wilson's point of view, however, this advancement had not yet occurred\".<ref>Sorrentino p. 53</ref>\n\n==Point of view==\n\"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is written in a third-person omniscient point of view with an omniscient narrator. \"The narrator is 'all-knowing' and 'can move from place to place... slipping into and out of characters'\".<ref>Meyers p. 216</ref> We as readers only follow a handful of characters and are always told what they say; never hearing their internal dialogue. We also get back stories of certain things that only an omnipotent narrator could know, \"...Maroon-colored flannel shirt, which had been purchased for purpose of decoration, and made principally by some Jewish woman on the east side of New York\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref>\n\n==Symbolism==\n*Jack Potter \u2013 The Sheriff/Marshal is unique in that he is one of only two named characters in the story. Stephen Crane chose his name with purpose. He is a wild west sheriff and yet has the bland name of Jack Potter, the opposite of what one would expect from a Texas marshal. \"By the 1890's, dead or retired where the marshals with such colorful names as Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, and Bat Masterson\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> The surname Potter is also a reference to a Potter's Field. \"Traditionally a graveyard for the homeless and friendless\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> Yellow Sky is Marshal Potter's field, watching over the dying West.\n*Yellow Sky \u2013 The entire town of Yellow Sky is a symbol, its name alone is \"indicative of sunsets and death... one huge cemetery for dying westerners\" <ref>Petry p. 46,</ref>\n*Scratchy Wilson \u2013 One of only two named characters in the story, Scratchy Wilson is the last old west gang member in town. His first name is one that makes him a demon like character. \"'Old Scratch' is a traditional nickname for the Devil. The 'y' suffix of 'Scratchy' however \u2013 deflates Wilson's demonism\".<ref>Petry p. 46/47</ref> He is seen in section III as a man dressed in a maroon shirt and red boots.These colors are classic representations of the Devil and help to present him as demon like. The name Scratchy also indicates of something that is irritating. The town finds his antics annoying but sees him as a mild threat.\n*The Train \u2013 It acts as a device to transport the east west. Trains in the mid-1800s opened the West and made it what it was. Towns would spring up all along the railways and lead to plentiful western settlements in these locations. The trains birthed these towns even though \"from the start [they] were condemned...predicted to be failures.\"<ref>Hudson p. 42</ref> This train, however, is bringing the death of Yellow Sky. Bringing salesmen, eastern clothing, and ultimately eastern ways of life, it is killing the Old West and replacing it with something else.\n*The Bride \u2013 Stephen Crane does not give her a name, only The Bride or Mrs. Potter. Stephen Crane makes her, as an individual, meaningless. She \"matters only as a representative of the new Eastern order\".<ref>Petry 46</ref> In the final scene of the story, she stops Scratchy Wilson from continuing his rampage, not as herself, but as an idea. Seeing her as incoming change, not to him personally but to the town and to Sheriff Potter, Wilson breaks down to a childlike state in the face of her and the inevitability of his way of life dying: \"Well, I 'low it's off Jack,\" said Wilson. He was looking at the ground. \"Married!\" He was not a student of chivalry; it was merely that in the presence of this foreign condition he was a  simple child on the earlier plains. He picked up his starboard revolver, and, placing both weapons in their holsters, he went away. His feet made funnel-shaped tracks in the heavy sand.<ref>Crane p. 307</ref>\n\n==Theme==\nMeyers calls theme \"the central idea or meaning of a story. It provides a unifying point around which the plot, characters, setting, point of view, symbols, and other elements of the story are organized.\"<ref>Crane p. 296</ref> The theme of \"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is \"the dying of the sentimentalized West with the encroachment of the lifestyle of the civilized East\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> The old west that once was is fading and very little is left. Scratchy Wilson is a leftover of that time. He was once a member of a wild west gang; now he is just a childlike drunk residing outside of town. Moreover, even though Scratchy is a symbol of a bygone era, he has been changed. He wears clothing from \"some Jewish woman on the East Side of New York\" and boots that were \"beloved in winter by little sledding boys\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> These items that he wears are not things you would find in Texas; they were likely brought in by salesmen or drummers into the town from the East. Scratchy is but a child and when faced with change that he is not ready for, he cowers back to his home with his head sunken.\n\n==Setting==\nThe story takes place in three main locations in the late 1800s: the train, the Weary Gentleman saloon, and outside Sheriff Jack Potter's house. The train and saloon help to set the period. A time where trains are a major form of transportation and in Yellow Sky's case, one of the only ways to get there. The saloon acts as a way to give insight and backstory to the two main characters, Jack and Scratchy. We get a perspective on the two from side characters in the story. The Sheriff's house, an immovable object in Scratchy's warpath, is the final scene of the story. \nPresently there came the spectacle of a madman churning himself into deepest rage over the immobility of a house. He fumed at it as the winter wind attacks a prairie cabin in the North. To the distance, there should have gone the sound of a tumult like the fighting of two hundred Mexicans. As necessity bade him, he paused for breath or to reload his revolvers.<ref>Crane p. 306</ref>\n\n==Imagery==\nCrane uses a vast amount of imagery in the story, for example; \"...Crane used nautical imagery in 'The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky' as a visual reminder of this westward movement.{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=Unclosed quotation marks make it unclear what's being quoted or where the quote ends.}} In the passenger-car with its \"sea-green figured velvet\",<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> a waiter, like a \"pilot,\"<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> is \"steering [Potter and his bride] through their meal\".<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> Contemplating the best way to sneak into Yellow Sky undetected, Potter envisions himself as a boat, \"a plains-craft\"<ref>Crane p. 302</ref> \u2013 to use a phrase invented by Crane. In the past, when Scratchy terrorized the town, Potter \"would sail in and pull out all the kinks in this thing\",<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> though this time the boat-like Potter encounters resistance as he and his bride, like two boat sails, \"put forth the efforts of a pair walking bowed against a strong wind\".<ref>Crane p. 306</ref> Confronted with the stormy Scratchy, the bride becomes a \"drowning woman\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> and Potter, despite attempts to maintain his course of direction, is \"stiffening and steadying\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> while \"a vision of the Pullman floated\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> in his mind as a symbol of his new condition. After Scratchy reluctantly accepts the end of the childlike drama that he and the marshal have repeatedly enacted in the past, he picks up his \"starboard revolver\",<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> \"his throat [working] like a pump\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> of a steamboat, and drifts away, his feet creating the \"funnel-shaped tracks\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> that form the wake of a boat symbolizing the funeral wake commemorating the passing of the frontier.<ref>Sorrentino p. 54</ref>\n\n== Sources ==\n*Howes, Kelly King.

Warns the town and patrons of the Weary Gentlemen.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe short story \"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is written to show the vast incline of society for the West.{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=What does \"incline\" mean in this context?}} Paul Sorrentino, a published essay writer, wrote about the correlation between the name Jack Potter and a political figure for Texas named Robert Potter. Robert Potter signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. \"In 1888 Archibald Clavering Gunter combined the exploits of various Potters from Texas in his enormously best selling novel ''Mr. Potter of Texas'', a romantic adventure about a Mr. Sampson Potter, the stereotypical rugged frontiersman with the cliched heart of gold, who had been a ranger, Congressman, cattleman, and sheriff\".<ref>Sorrentino p. 53</ref> \"By the time that Crane wrote 'The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky' in 1897 about a Texas marshal named Jack Potter, the names Potter and Texas Jack were legendary symbols of the self-made frontiersman who helped pave the west for the advance of civilization. From Scratchy Wilson's point of view, however, this advancement had not yet occurred\".<ref>Sorrentino p. 53</ref>\n\n==Point of view==\n\"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is written in a third-person omniscient point of view with an omniscient narrator. \"The narrator is 'all-knowing' and 'can move from place to place... slipping into and out of characters'\".<ref>Meyers p. 216</ref> We as readers only follow a handful of characters and are always told what they say; never hearing their internal dialogue. We also get back stories of certain things that only an omnipotent narrator could know, \"...Maroon-colored flannel shirt, which had been purchased for purpose of decoration, and made principally by some Jewish woman on the east side of New York\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref>\n\n==Symbolism==\n*Jack Potter \u2013 The Sheriff/Marshal is unique in that he is one of only two named characters in the story. Stephen Crane chose his name with purpose. He is a wild west sheriff and yet has the bland name of Jack Potter, the opposite of what one would expect from a Texas marshal. \"By the 1890's, dead or retired where the marshals with such colorful names as Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, and Bat Masterson\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> The surname Potter is also a reference to a Potter's Field. \"Traditionally a graveyard for the homeless and friendless\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> Yellow Sky is Marshal Potter's field, watching over the dying West.\n*Yellow Sky \u2013 The entire town of Yellow Sky is a symbol, its name alone is \"indicative of sunsets and death... one huge cemetery for dying westerners\" <ref>Petry p. 46,</ref>\n*Scratchy Wilson \u2013 One of only two named characters in the story, Scratchy Wilson is the last old west gang member in town. His first name is one that makes him a demon like character. \"'Old Scratch' is a traditional nickname for the Devil. The 'y' suffix of 'Scratchy' however \u2013 deflates Wilson's demonism\".<ref>Petry p. 46/47</ref> He is seen in section III as a man dressed in a maroon shirt and red boots.These colors are classic representations of the Devil and help to present him as demon like. The name Scratchy also indicates of something that is irritating. The town finds his antics annoying but sees him as a mild threat.\n*The Train \u2013 It acts as a device to transport the east west. Trains in the mid-1800s opened the West and made it what it was. Towns would spring up all along the railways and lead to plentiful western settlements in these locations. The trains birthed these towns even though \"from the start [they] were condemned...predicted to be failures.\"<ref>Hudson p. 42</ref> This train, however, is bringing the death of Yellow Sky. Bringing salesmen, eastern clothing, and ultimately eastern ways of life, it is killing the Old West and replacing it with something else.\n*The Bride \u2013 Stephen Crane does not give her a name, only The Bride or Mrs. Potter. Stephen Crane makes her, as an individual, meaningless. She \"matters only as a representative of the new Eastern order\".<ref>Petry 46</ref> In the final scene of the story, she stops Scratchy Wilson from continuing his rampage, not as herself, but as an idea. Seeing her as incoming change, not to him personally but to the town and to Sheriff Potter, Wilson breaks down to a childlike state in the face of her and the inevitability of his way of life dying: \"Well, I 'low it's off Jack,\" said Wilson. He was looking at the ground. \"Married!\" He was not a student of chivalry; it was merely that in the presence of this foreign condition he was a  simple child on the earlier plains. He picked up his starboard revolver, and, placing both weapons in their holsters, he went away. His feet made funnel-shaped tracks in the heavy sand.<ref>Crane p. 307</ref>\n\n==Theme==\nMeyers calls theme \"the central idea or meaning of a story. It provides a unifying point around which the plot, characters, setting, point of view, symbols, and other elements of the story are organized.\"<ref>Crane p. 296</ref> The theme of \"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky\" is \"the dying of the sentimentalized West with the encroachment of the lifestyle of the civilized East\".<ref>Petry p. 46</ref> The old west that once was is fading and very little is left. Scratchy Wilson is a leftover of that time. He was once a member of a wild west gang; now he is just a childlike drunk residing outside of town. Moreover, even though Scratchy is a symbol of a bygone era, he has been changed. He wears clothing from \"some Jewish woman on the East Side of New York\" and boots that were \"beloved in winter by little sledding boys\".<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> These items that he wears are not things you would find in Texas; they were likely brought in by salesmen or drummers into the town from the East. Scratchy is but a child and when faced with change that he is not ready for, he cowers back to his home with his head sunken.\n\n==Setting==\nThe story takes place in three main locations in the late 1800s: the train, the Weary Gentleman saloon, and outside Sheriff Jack Potter's house. The train and saloon help to set the period. A time where trains are a major form of transportation and in Yellow Sky's case, one of the only ways to get there. The saloon acts as a way to give insight and backstory to the two main characters, Jack and Scratchy. We get a perspective on the two from side characters in the story. The Sheriff's house, an immovable object in Scratchy's warpath, is the final scene of the story. \nPresently there came the spectacle of a madman churning himself into deepest rage over the immobility of a house. He fumed at it as the winter wind attacks a prairie cabin in the North. To the distance, there should have gone the sound of a tumult like the fighting of two hundred Mexicans. As necessity bade him, he paused for breath or to reload his revolvers.<ref>Crane p. 306</ref>\n\n==Imagery==\nCrane uses a vast amount of imagery in the story, for example; \"...Crane used nautical imagery in 'The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky' as a visual reminder of this westward movement.{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=Unclosed quotation marks make it unclear what's being quoted or where the quote ends.}} In the passenger-car with its \"sea-green figured velvet\",<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> a waiter, like a \"pilot,\"<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> is \"steering [Potter and his bride] through their meal\".<ref>Crane p. 301</ref> Contemplating the best way to sneak into Yellow Sky undetected, Potter envisions himself as a boat, \"a plains-craft\"<ref>Crane p. 302</ref> \u2013 to use a phrase invented by Crane. In the past, when Scratchy terrorized the town, Potter \"would sail in and pull out all the kinks in this thing\",<ref>Crane p. 305</ref> though this time the boat-like Potter encounters resistance as he and his bride, like two boat sails, \"put forth the efforts of a pair walking bowed against a strong wind\".<ref>Crane p. 306</ref> Confronted with the stormy Scratchy, the bride becomes a \"drowning woman\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> and Potter, despite attempts to maintain his course of direction, is \"stiffening and steadying\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> while \"a vision of the Pullman floated\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> in his mind as a symbol of his new condition. After Scratchy reluctantly accepts the end of the childlike drama that he and the marshal have repeatedly enacted in the past, he picks up his \"starboard revolver\",<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> \"his throat [working] like a pump\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> of a steamboat, and drifts away, his feet creating the \"funnel-shaped tracks\"<ref>Crane p. 307</ref> that form the wake of a boat symbolizing the funeral wake commemorating the passing of the frontier.<ref>Sorrentino p. 54</ref>\n\n== Sources ==\n*Howes, Kelly King.

It was built until 1897 to serve the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill|Mulgrave Central Sugar Mill]], built in 1895. The line, which led through difficult terrain including dense jungle, was built by the [[Cairns Divisional Board]], later renamed [[Cairns Shire Council]], at a cost of \u00a315,319. The line originally ran from Cairns to Nelson, later renamed [[Gordonvale]]. In 1898 it was extended to [[Aloomba, Queensland|Aloomba]], and in 1910 it was finally extended to [[Babinda]], over a length of {{convert|50|km|mi}}. The end point in Cairns was between Spence and Bunda Street, adjacent to the [[Queensland Government|Queensland Government's]] [[Cairns railway station]], with which the line was connected by a short distance.<ref name=\"Rohn\">Gerhard Rohn: [http://www.sammlerring-australia.de/index_htm_files/Cairns.pdf Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114184505/http://www.sammlerring-australia.de/index_htm_files/Cairns.pdf |date=2018-01-14 }} Sammlerring Australia e.V., 115/2015.</ref>\n\nThe line was officially opened on 3 May 1897 with an excursion from Cairns to Nelson. Initially, the Cairns Divisional Board had only one small locomotive, built in 1879 in [[Philadelphia]], USA, and a second locomotive was added in 1898. In the beginning, passenger coaches and good carriages were rented from the Queensland Government until the company acquired its own stock from [[Phoenix Engineering Co]] and [[Shillito & Sons]], both based in [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. Later, ten ''F'' wagons and five ''H'' wagons and two wooden wagons were bought from the [[Toowoomba Foundry|Toowoomba Foundry Company]].<ref name=\"Rohn\"/> In the year up to 30 June 1899, the tramway carried 54,996 passengers and 71,688 tonnes of freight.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> The service was so successful that a payment of \u00a3892 was made to the government. On 1 July 1911, the Queensland Government bought the line and integrated it into [[Queensland Rail]].<ref name=\"Rohn\"/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Planning ===\nThe formation of the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill|Mulgrave Central Mill Company Ltd]] in November 1893 under the provisions of the Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893 gave rise to the idea that a fourteen miles long tramway with a gauge of 2&nbsp;ft should be constructed by the board from Cairns to the [[Mulgrave River]]. The mill company was registered on 20 April 1895. In May, Mr O. Phillips, at the request of the board, inspected the proposed route and reported upon the proposal. His recommendation that the normal railway gauge of the colony should be adopted was agreed to, and it was decided to retain his services as consulting engineer for the purposes of the tramway. Towards the end of May the survey was commenced, following, wherever practicable, existing roads of the division. In July the survey was completed to the Mulgrave, the minimum curve being 10 chains (201 m) radius, and the steepest gradient 1 in 82\u00bd.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 76401 Staff of the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway, ca. 1905.jpg|thumb|Staff of the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway, ca. 1905]]\nThe board having complied with the regulations and provisions of the various Local Government Acts, and having arranged for a loan from the Government, tenders were invited for the construction of the line to the Mulgrave, and that of Messrs. Kirk Brothers and Frew (\u00a315,319 13s.) was accepted by the board, and the work was satisfactorily completed towards the end of April 1897. The line was entirely unfenced, but in other respects, the usual railway practice of the colony has been followed, except that the formation is only 12&nbsp;ft. wide, whilst soil ballast has been chiefly used. Several of the bridges also were low-level.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe average cost per mile open, for construction only, to 30 June 1898. including two miles of mixed gauge, was \u00a31827. In order to facilitate the operations of the Mulgrave Central Mill Company, the board consented to lay two miles of mixed gauge, thus enabling the mill company's narrow gauge locomotives to haul cane and firewood over the board's tramway from 11\u00be miles to the mill. A similar arrangement was made for about 1\u00bd miles on the Aloomba extension.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Inauguration ===\n[[File:Opening of the Cairns-Mulgrave tramway in May 1897 at the Mulgrave sugar mill, Gordonvale.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Cairns-Mulgrave tramway on 3 May 1897 at the Mulgrave sugar mill, Gordonvale]]\nThe first section, in length 13 miles 75 chains 19 links was opened for public traffic on 3 May 1897. At that time the entire rolling stock available for use comprised one 11 inch cylinder locomotive, built at the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in [[Philadelphia]], U.S.A., in 1879(purchased from the Railway Department, Cairns, for the sum of \u00a3700), and five second-hand ballast waggons, purchased at [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]] from the railway contractors Messrs. James Overend & Co for the sum of \u00a3125. Subsequently, ten ''F'' waggons, five ''H'' waggons, and two timber waggons were built for the board by the Toowoomba Foundry Company. A tramcar with seating accommodation for sixty passengers, which had been previously in use on the Government lines, was purchased from the Railway Department, in [[Brisbane]], for \u00a3100. With the assistance of a guard's van and a convertible car, the latter was exclusively for indigenous passengers \u2014 hired from the Railway Department, together with other passenger and goods stock hired from the department as occasion demanded, the board was enabled to cope with the rapidly increasing traffic in the first year in a fairly satisfactory manner. The total cost of the board's rolling-stock in use to 30 June 1898, was \u00a32879 8s. 8d., equal to \u00a3206 11s. per mile open.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway was the first public tramway in Australia. The line from Cairns to Aloomba was initially 17 miles long. It had the same gauge as the [[Queensland Rail|Queensland Government Railways]] (3&nbsp;ft 6 in) and used the same rails. Thus all rolling stock was interchangeable. The first engine and carriages were purchased from the Government, and Government carriages were frequently hired, when the rush of passenger traffic overwhelmed the tramway's resources.<ref name=\"Trove\">[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22563578 ''The Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114184310/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22563578 |date=2018-01-14 }} The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. : 1866 - 1939),  Saturday, 23 December 1899. Page 1241.</ref>\n\nThe train only stopped by signal to take on passengers or parcels, with the passengers wishing to alight giving notice to the guard at the preceding station.<ref name=\"Elsmore\"/>\n\n=== First extension === \nIn consequence of the subdivision and planting with cane of a large area of rich scrub land on the southern side of the Mulgrave River, in connection with the proposed ''Aloomba Central Mill'', which, however, eventually fell through, the board decided to extend the tramway across the river as far as the main Russell road, a distance of 3 miles 61 chains. Subsequently, the cane farmers on the Aloomba Estate arranged with the board to carry some 30,000 tons of cane from Aloomba to the Colonial Refining Company's mill at Hambledon, a distance of about twelve miles, at the rate of 10d. per ton for the first year, the company at the same time agreeing with the board to construct at their own cost a branch line about 2 miles in length on a gauge of 3&nbsp;ft. 6 in. to connect their mill with the tramway.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nIn July 1897, the board entered into a contract for the construction of two low-level timber bridges, having a total length of 660&nbsp;ft. at the tramway crossing of the Mulgrave River. The bridges were built entirely with Southern timber. On 1 April 1898, the construction of the Aloomba extension was commenced from the southern bank of the river, and, with the exception of the Mulgrave Bridge, was carried out by day labour, being complete and opened for traffic in August, 1898.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nAlthough the road was chiefly ballasted with soil, and was entirely unfenced, thus exposing the formation to the free passage of cattle and horses, no difficulty has been experienced in maintaining a fair top on the rail road, sufficiently good for the maximum speed allowed. Stone ballast has been put on the rail road during maintenance as it appeared advisable, but the total quantity thus put out in the first year (exclusive of 1500 yards used in construction) did not exceed 700 cubic yards. Although the wet season was fairly heavy (78.311 in. between 1 December 1897 and 30 April 1898), the traffic was not interrupted in any way.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nOn the extension to Aloomba a siding was laid in the bed of the Mulgrave River from which an ample supply of clean coarse sand and shingle, suitable for ballast, was obtainable. This ballast could be put out on the rail road at an average cost of 2s. 6d. per cubic yard. As opportunity offers, the line was gradually reballasted with this material.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Maintenance and operation ===\nThe total mileage maintained to 30 June 1898, was 15.027 miles, including sidings, and the total expenditure on maintenance for the whole period of one year and fifty-nine days was \u00a3917 os. 8d., equal to \u00a365 15s. 8d. per mile of main line only for the whole period, and \u00a356 12s. 8d. per mile of main line only for the twelve months that ended on 30 June 1898. The cost per train mile for the whole period was 9\u00bcd.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nWith the exception of the sum of \u00a3886 16s. expended on the Mulgrave Bridge and approaches out of a sum of \u00a31500 granted for that purpose by the Government, the whole of the capital account consiste of money borrowed from the Government under the provisions of the Local Works Loans Act of 1880. Including the \u00a3886 16s. above referred to, the total capital on 30 June 1898, amounted to \u00a344,281. The revenue derived from the working of the tramway from the opening of the first section on 3 May 1897 to 30 June 1898, a period of one year and 59 days, was as follows:<ref name=\"Trove\" /> \n*Passengers: \u00a32504  \n*Goods and miscellaneous: \u00a32874 \n*Total: \u00a35878\n*Deduct working expenses: \u00a33424\n*Net revenue: \u00a31953\n\nThe percentage of working expenses to revenue was 63.67, and of net revenue to capital expended on open line 6.89 for the whole period. After payments of interest to the Treasury, in addition to working expenses, the revenue balance on 30 June 1898, was \u00a3696. On 30 June 1899 the total capital amounted to \u00a352,572 14s. 4d., the expenditure from which has been \u00a350,220, leaving an unexpended balance to the credit of the Tramway Loan Fund of \u00a32352, this amount not having been drawn from the Treasury on that date. Interest actually paid by the board up to 30 June 1899 amounted to \u00a32969, and redemption to \u00a3892. The total revenue has been \u00a314,967, and the net revenue \u00a35344.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe percentage of working expenses to revenue for the twelve months was 64.64, and for the whole period during which the tramway has been working, 64.29; in other words, every \u00a3100 earned by the tramway from the date of opening on the Srd May, 1897, to 30 June 1899, cost \u00a364 5s. 10\u00bed. The percentage of net revenue to capital expended on open line for the twelve months ended 30 June last is \u00a36 18s. 1\u00bdd., as compared with \u00a35 18s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. After deducting working expenses and payments to the Treasury on account of interest and redemption, the revenue balance for the twelve months ended on 30 June 1899 was \u00a3735.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Second year of operation ===\n54,996 passengers were carried in twelve months up to 30 June 1899. The receipts from passenger fares amounted to \u00a33013, an increase of \u00a3508 as compared with the period of one year and fifty-nine days ended on 8 June 1898. The average fare paid by the 54,996 passengers carried was 13.16d. The coaching traffic amounted to 31.4 per cent of the gross revenue, as compared with 46.6 per cent for the period previous to 30 June 1898.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThere was seating accommodation for 180 passengers, but there were times when this was insufficient, and two composite passenger cars were built by the Phoenix Engineering Company, of Ipswich. They had plain but suitable accommodation for about 20 first-class and 35 second-class passengers each. They were due for delivery in December 1899.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nIn addition to general merchandise, the goods traffic comprises bananas and fruit, sugarcane, manufactured sugar from the Mulgrave and Hambledon mills, round timber, firewood, soil for fllllng-up purposes in town, road metal for the council, mineral ores from the Russell and Herberton districts, and ships' ballast. The minimum charge was 3s. 9d. per ton for ordinary merchandise, and 2s. 6d. per ton for agricultural produce other than raw sugar and sugar cane; the latter was carried from Aloomba to Hambledon (12 miles) for 14d. per ton. The minimum charge made by the Railway Department for the carriage of sugarcane in full truckloads, a distance of fifteen miles and under, is 20d. per ton; in 1898 the charge on the tramway was 10d. per ton for the Aloomba-Hambledon service, but this was found by actual experience to be unremunerative, bearing in mind the large capital expenditure incurred for the special purpose of enabling the Aloomba farmers to harvest their cane. The total weight of goods carried during the twelve months waa 71,688 tons, for \u00a36353, equal to 66.25 per cent of the gross revenue.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe length of line maintained in 1898, including sidings, but exclusive of mixed gauge, was 20.22 miles. The mixed gauge portion of the line, in length 3.2375 miles, carried 9253 tons of cane and firewood on the narrow gauge, in addition to the board's ordinary traffic on the broader gauge. The actual mileage maintained, including the mixed gauge, was, therefore, equivalent to 23.5075 miles, and the cost per mile \u00a356 5s. 11\u00bed.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe train mileage increased from 23,590 miles for the period of one year and fifty-nine days, up to 30 June 1898, to 43,481 miles tor the twelve months up to 30 June 1898, an increase of 84.3 per cent, whilst the expenditure on maintenance increased by 44.3 per cent.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 270589 Baldwin B13 class steam locomotive, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baldwin B13 class steam locomotive No. 5, 1892. <!--According to https://www.facebook.com/LostCairns/posts/1043438459035647:0 the following information is wrong: The locomotive was built jointly in England by [[Kitson & Co.]] and [[Deeks & Co.]] and was first introduced in 1892.--> It was purchased in 1911 by the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway and used there until 1924.]]\nThe board's rolling stock consisted in 1899 of three locomotives, 5 passenger cars, 69 goods waggons, and two guards' vans.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nA Class 5 steam locomotive was built in February 1908 by [[Burnham, Williams & Co]] with works number 32678 for the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.<ref>[http://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=Australia&wheel=4-6-0&railroad=cmt Cairns Mulgrave Tramway 4-6-0 Locomotives in Australia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071718/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=Australia&wheel=4-6-0&railroad=cmt |date=2018-01-15 }}</ref>\n\nA small B11 Baldwin Class engine was initially ordered for the Great Northern Railway.

In conjunction with this proposal there is a scheme for the establishment of a central mill at [[Babinda Creek]], which would serve and be served by the extension. The distance from Aloomba to Babinda Creek is twenty miles. The Government has placed \u00a365,000 on the estimates for the purpose of equipping the mill under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, and there would probably be 10,000 tons of sugar to be conveyed from this mill to port \neach season, as almost the whole of the country along the line is agricultural land.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nIt was estimated that there were available already about 33,000 acres. 24,700 acres of which were classed as first-class, 4500 acres as second-class. Since the survey has been made, about 4000 acres In addition have been taken up in anticipation of the building of the mill and the railway, and there was a further considerable area of land not yet alienated which was estimated at 20,000 acres. The Cairns Chamber of Commence has taken the matter up, and was vigorously pushing it to a conclusion. In addition to the sugar prospects there was an unlimited quantity of valuable timber, which was at present worthless because of the want or means of carriage. It is urged in support of the scheme that the Mulgrave Central Mill has disbursed \u00a3130,000 among the farmers and wage-earners, and has paid the Government as interest \u00a34264. The farmers on Aloomba Estate have earned \u00a330,000 from cane growing in the last two seasons. A similar and even better result was anticipated, if the tramway would have been extended to the Russell district, in conjunction with a central sugar-mill.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Higher bridge ===\n[[File:Railway bridge over Babinda Creek on the Cairns-Mulgrave Line. The range in the background is Bellenden-Ker.jpg|thumb|Railway bridge over Babinda Creek on the Cairns-Mulgrave Line, 1912. The range in the background is [[Bellenden Ker]]]]\nThe Cairns Shire Council kept a boat at the Mulgrave River because the low-level bridge was regularly flooded. On one occasion, the engine was rushed through floodwaters, when the water was already over the bridge and high enough that it nearly put the fire out. In January 1907 the water level was up to {{convert|20|feet|m}} over the bridge. Thus a new bridge at a higher level was built over the Mulgrave River and completed in mid 1935. It was built to 12 ton axle load as part of the program to strengthen the line. Its completion enabled C16 and C17 class locomotives to operate between Cairns and Babinda instead of only PB15 and B15 class and lighter engines. Expenditure on the bridge and deviation in 1934-35 amounted to \u00a313,720. Although higher than the first bridge, the second bridge was still subject to frequent flooding. This curved wooden bridge was one of the last major river crossings on the North Coast Line, and has now been replaced by a third high level pre stressed concrete structure.<ref name=\"Elsmore\"/>\n\n=== Nationalisation ===\nOn 1 July 1911, the Queensland Government bought the line (including all inventories) from [[Cairns Shire Council]] for \u00a3158,650 and integrated it into the State Railway System.

It was built until 1897 to serve the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill|Mulgrave Central Sugar Mill]], built in 1895. The line, which led through difficult terrain including dense jungle, was built by the [[Cairns Divisional Board]], later renamed [[Cairns Shire Council]], at a cost of \u00a315,319. The line originally ran from Cairns to Nelson, later renamed [[Gordonvale]]. In 1898 it was extended to [[Aloomba, Queensland|Aloomba]], and in 1910 it was finally extended to [[Babinda]], over a length of {{convert|50|km|mi}}. The end point in Cairns was between Spence and Bunda Street, adjacent to the [[Queensland Government|Queensland Government's]] [[Cairns railway station]], with which the line was connected by a short distance.<ref name=\"Rohn\">Gerhard Rohn: [http://www.sammlerring-australia.de/index_htm_files/Cairns.pdf Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114184505/http://www.sammlerring-australia.de/index_htm_files/Cairns.pdf |date=2018-01-14 }} Sammlerring Australia e.V., 115/2015.</ref> \n\nThe line was officially opened on 3 May 1897 with an excursion from Cairns to Nelson. Initially, the Cairns Divisional Board had only one small locomotive, built in 1879 in [[Philadelphia]], USA, and a second locomotive was added in 1898. In the beginning, passenger coaches and good carriages were rented from the Queensland Government until the company acquired its own stock from [[Phoenix Engineering Co]] and [[Shillito & Sons]], both based in [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. Later, ten ''F'' wagons and five ''H'' wagons and two wooden wagons were bought from the [[Toowoomba Foundry|Toowoomba Foundry Company]].<ref name=\"Rohn\"/> In the year up to 30 June 1899, the tramway carried 54,996 passengers and 71,688 tonnes of freight.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> The service was so successful that a payment of \u00a3892 was made to the government. On 1 July 1911, the Queensland Government bought the line and integrated it into [[Queensland Rail]].<ref name=\"Rohn\"/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Planning ===\nThe formation of the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill|Mulgrave Central Mill Company Ltd]] in November 1893 under the provisions of the Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893 gave rise to the idea that a fourteen miles long tramway with a gauge of 2 ft should be constructed by the board from Cairns to the [[Mulgrave River]]. The mill company was registered on 20 April 1895. In May, Mr O. Phillips, at the request of the board, inspected the proposed route and reported upon the proposal. His recommendation that the normal railway gauge of the colony should be adopted was agreed to, and it was decided to retain his services as consulting engineer for the purposes of the tramway. Towards the end of May the survey was commenced, following, wherever practicable, existing roads of the division. In July the survey was completed to the Mulgrave, the minimum curve being 10 chains (201 m) radius, and the steepest gradient 1 in 82\u00bd.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 76401 Staff of the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway, ca. 1905.jpg|thumb|Staff of the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway, ca. 1905]]\nThe board having complied with the regulations and provisions of the various Local Government Acts, and having arranged for a loan from the Government, tenders were invited for the construction of the line to the Mulgrave, and that of Messrs. Kirk Brothers and Frew (\u00a315,319 13s.) was accepted by the board, and the work was satisfactorily completed towards the end of April 1897. The line was entirely unfenced, but in other respects, the usual railway practice of the colony has been followed, except that the formation is only 12ft. wide, whilst soil ballast has been chiefly used. Several of the bridges also were low-level.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe average cost per mile open, for construction only, to 30 June 1898. including two miles of mixed gauge, was \u00a31827. In order to facilitate the operations of the Mulgrave Central Mill Company, the board consented to lay two miles of mixed gauge, thus enabling the mill company's narrow gauge locomotives to haul cane and firewood over the board's tramway from 11\u00be miles to the mill. A similar arrangement was made for about 1\u00bd miles on the Aloomba extension.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Inauguration ===\n[[File:Opening of the Cairns-Mulgrave tramway in May 1897 at the Mulgrave sugar mill, Gordonvale.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Cairns-Mulgrave tramway on 3 May 1897 at the Mulgrave sugar mill, Gordonvale]]\nThe first section, in length 13 miles 75 chains 19 links was opened for public traffic on 3 May 1897. At that time the entire rolling stock available for use comprised one 11 inch cylinder locomotive, built at the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in [[Philadelphia]], U.S.A., in 1879(purchased from the Railway Department, Cairns, for the sum of \u00a3700), and five second-hand ballast waggons, purchased at [[Gladstone]] from the railway contractors Messrs. James Overend & Co for the sum of \u00a3125. Subsequently ten ''F'' waggons, five ''H'' waggons, and two timber waggons were built for the board by the Toowoomba Foundry Company. A tramcar with seating accommodation for sixty passengers, which had been previously in use on the Government lines, was purchased from the Railway Department, in [[Brisbane]], for \u00a3100. With the assistance of a guard's van and a convertible car, the latter was exclusively for indigenous passengers \u2014 hired from the Railway Department, together with other passenger and goods stock hired from the department as occasion demanded, the board was enabled to cope with the rapidly increasing traffic in the first year in a fairly satisfactory manner. The total cost of the board's rolling-stock in use to 30 June 1898, was \u00a32879 8s. 8d., equal to \u00a3206 11s. per mile open.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway was the first public tramway in Australia. The line from Cairns to Aloomba was initially 17 miles long. It had the same gauge as the [[Queensland Rail|Queensland Government Railways]] (3 ft 6 in) and used the same rails. Thus all rolling stock was interchangeable. The first engine and carriages were purchased from the Government, and Government carriages were frequently hired, when the rush of passenger traffic overwhelmed the tramway's resources.<ref name=\"Trove\">[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22563578 ''The Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114184310/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22563578 |date=2018-01-14 }} The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. : 1866 - 1939),  Saturday, 23 December 1899. Page 1241.</ref> \n\nThe train only stopped by signal to take on passengers or parcels, with the passengers wishing to alight giving notice to the guard at the preceding station.<ref name=\"Elsmore\"/>\n\n=== First extension === \nIn consequence of the subdivision and planting with cane of a large area of rich scrub land on the southern side of the Mulgrave River, in connection with the proposed ''Aloomba Central Mill'', which, however, eventually fell through, the board decided to extend the tramway across the river as far as the main Russell road, a distance of 3 miles 61 chains. Subsequently, the cane farmers on the Aloomba Estate arranged with the board to carry some 30,000 tons of cane from Aloomba to the Colonial Refining Company's mill at Hambledon, a distance of about twelve miles, at the rate of 10d. per ton for the first year, the company at the same time agreeing with the board to construct at their own cost a branch line about 2 miles in length on a gauge of 3 ft. 6 in. to connect their mill with the tramway.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nIn July 1897, the board entered into a contract for the construction of two low-level timber bridges, having a total length of 660ft. at the tramway crossing of the Mulgrave River. The bridges were built entirely with Southern timber. On 1 April 1898, the construction of the Aloomba extension was commenced from the southern bank of the river, and, with the exception of the Mulgrave Bridge, was carried out by day labour, being complete and opened for traffic in August, 1898.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nAlthough the road was chiefly ballasted with soil, and was entirely unfenced, thus exposing the formation to the free passage of cattle and horses, no difficulty has been experienced in maintaining a fair top on the rail road, sufficiently good for the maximum speed allowed. Stone ballast has been put on the rail road during maintenance as it appeared advisable, but the total quantity thus put out in the first year (exclusive of 1500 yards used in construction) did not exceed 700 cubic yards. Although the wet season was fairly heavy (78.311 in. between 1 December 1897 and 30 April 1898), the traffic was not interrupted in any way.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> \n\nOn the extension to Aloomba a siding was laid in the bed of the Mulgrave River from which an ample supply of clean coarse sand and shingle, suitable for ballast, was obtainable. This ballast could be put out on the rail road at an average cost of 2s. 6d. per cubic yard. As opportunity offers, the line was gradually reballasted with this material.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Maintenance and operation ===\nThe total mileage maintained to 30 June 1898, was 15.027 miles, including sidings, and the total expenditure on maintenance for the whole period of one year and fifty-nine days was \u00a3917 os. 8d., equal to \u00a365 15s. 8d. per mile of main line only for the whole period, and \u00a356 12s. 8d. per mile of main line only for the twelve months that ended on 30 June 1898. The cost per train mile for the whole period was 9\u00bcd.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nWith the exception of the sum of \u00a3886 16s. expended on the Mulgrave Bridge and approaches out of a sum of \u00a31500 granted for that purpose by the Government, the whole of the capital account consiste of money borrowed from the Government under the provisions of the Local Works Loans Act of 1880. Including the \u00a3886 16s. above referred to, the total capital on 30 June 1898, amounted to \u00a3 44,281. The revenue derived from the working of the tramway from the opening of the first section on 3 May 1897 to 30 June 1898, a period of one year and 59 days, was as follows:<ref name=\"Trove\" /> \n*Passengers: \u00a32504  \n*Goods and miscellaneous: \u00a32874 \n*Total: \u00a35878\n*Deduct working expenses: \u00a33424\n*Net revenue: \u00a31953\n\nThe percentage of working expenses to revenue was 63.67, and of net revenue to capital expended on open line 6.89 for the whole period. After payments of interest to the Treasury, in addition to working expenses, the revenue balance on 30 June 1898, was \u00a3696. On 30 June 1899 the total capital amounted to \u00a352,572 14s. 4d., the expenditure from which has been \u00a350,220, leaving an unexpended balance to the credit of the Tramway Loan Fund of \u00a32352, this amount not having been drawn from the Treasury on that date. Interest actually paid by the board up to 30 June 1899 amounted to \u00a32969, and redemption to \u00a3892. The total revenue has been \u00a314,967, and the net revenue \u00a35344.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> \n\nThe percentage of working expenses to revenue for the twelve months was 64.64, and for the whole period during which the tramway has been working, 64.29; in other words, every \u00a3100 earned by the tramway from the date of opening on the Srd May, 1897, to 30 June 1899, cost \u00a364 5s. 10\u00bed. The percentage of net revenue to capital expended on open line for the twelve months ended 30 June last is \u00a36 18s. 1\u00bdd., as compared with \u00a35 18s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. After deducting working expenses and payments to the Treasury on account of interest and redemption, the revenue balance for the twelve months ended on 30 June 1899 was \u00a3735.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Second year of operation ===\n54,996 passengers were carried in twelve months up to 30 June 1899. The receipts from passenger fares amounted to \u00a33013, an increase of \u00a3508 as compared with the period of one year and fifty-nine days ended on 8 June 1898. The average fare paid by the 54,996 passengers carried was 13.16d. The coaching traffic amounted to 31.4 per cent of the gross revenue, as compared with 46.6 per cent for the period previous to 30 June 1898.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThere was seating accommodation for 180 passengers, but there were times when this was insufficient, and two composite passenger cars were built by the Phoenix Engineering Company, of Ipswich. They had plain but suitable accommodation for about 20 first-class and 35 second-class passengers each. They were due for delivery in December 1899.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> \n\nIn addition to general merchandise, the goods traffic comprises bananas and fruit, sugarcane, manufactured sugar from the Mulgrave and Hambledon mills, round timber, firewood, soil for fllllng-up purposes in town, road metal for the council, mineral ores from the Russell and Herberton districts, and ships' ballast. The minimum charge was 3s. 9d. per ton for ordinary merchandise, and 2s. 6d. per ton for agricultural produce other than raw sugar and sugar cane; the latter was carried from Aloomba to Hambledon (12 miles) for 14d. per ton. The minimum charge made by the Railway Department for the carriage of sugarcane in full truckloads, a distance of fifteen miles and under, is 20d. per ton; in 1898 the charge on the tramway was 10d. per ton for the Aloomba-Hambledon service, but this was found by actual experience to be unremunerative, bearing in mind the large capital expenditure incurred for the special purpose of enabling the Aloomba farmers to harvest their cane. The total weight of goods carried during the twelve months waa 71,688 tons, for \u00a36353, equal to 66.25 per cent of the gross revenue.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nThe length of line maintained in 1898, including sidings, but exclusive of mixed gauge, was 20.22 miles. The mixed gauge portion of the line, in length 3.2375 miles, carried 9253 tons of cane and firewood on the narrow gauge, in addition to the board's ordinary traffic on the broader gauge. The actual mileage maintained, including the mixed gauge, was, therefore, equivalent to 23.5075 miles, and the cost per mile \u00a356 5s. 11\u00bed.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> \n\nThe train mileage increased from 23,590 miles for the period of one year and fifty-nine days, up to 30 June 1898, to 43,481 miles tor the twelve months up to 30 June 1898, an increase of 84.3 per cent, whilst the expenditure on maintenance increased by 44.3 per cent.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 270589 Baldwin B13 class steam locomotive, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baldwin B13 class steam locomotive No. 5, 1892. <!--According to https://www.facebook.com/LostCairns/posts/1043438459035647:0 the following information is wrong: The locomotive was built jointly in England by [[Kitson & Co.]] and [[Deeks & Co.]] and was first introduced in 1892.--> It was purchased in 1911 by the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway and used there until 1924.]]\nThe board's rolling stock consisted in 1899 of three locomotives, 5 passenger cars, 69 goods waggons, and two guards' vans.<ref name=\"Trove\"/> \n\nA Class 5 steam locomotive was built in February 1908 by [[Burnham, Williams & Co]] with works number 32678 for the Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway.<ref>[http://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=Australia&wheel=4-6-0&railroad=cmt Cairns Mulgrave Tramway 4-6-0 Locomotives in Australia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071718/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=Australia&wheel=4-6-0&railroad=cmt |date=2018-01-15 }}</ref>\n\nA small B11 Baldwin Class engine was initially ordered for the Great Northern Railway. It had a remarkable career with numerous changes in ownership. It was assembled in Townsville and then sold to a contractor before it had even entered service. It was later repurchased only to be again resold to the same contractor. Repurchased again it was then sold to Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway only to be returned when tramway assets were acquired under the North Coast Railway Act.<ref>[http://www.qrig.org/motive-power/locomotives/steam/b11-baldwin-class B11 Baldwin Class.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609120742/http://www.qrig.org/motive-power/locomotives/steam/b11-baldwin-class |date=2017-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n=== Second extension ===\nA proposal was under consideration in December 1899 for the extension of the tramway from Aloomba into the heart of the Russell River district, which is embraced in the Cairns division, and for which the port of Cairns is the natural outlet. In conjunction with this proposal there is a scheme for the establishment of a central mill at [[Babinda Creek]], which would serve and be served by the extension. The distance from Aloomba to Babinda Creek is twenty miles. The Government has placed \u00a365,000 on the estimates for the purpose of equipping the mill under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, and there would probably be 10,000 tons of sugar to be conveyed from this mill to port \neach season, as almost the whole of the country along the line is agricultural land.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\nIt was estimated that there were available already about 33,000 acres. 24,700 acres of which were classed as first-class, 4500 acres as second-class. Since the survey has been made, about 4000 acres In addition have been taken up in anticipation of the building of the mill and the railway, and there was a further considerable area of land not yet alienated which was estimated at 20,000 acres. The Cairns Chamber of Commence has taken the matter up, and was vigorously pushing it to a conclusion. In addition to the sugar prospects there was an unlimited quantity of valuable timber, which was at present worthless because of the want or means of carriage. It is urged in support of the scheme that the Mulgrave Central Mill has disbursed \u00a3130,000 among the farmers and wage-earners, and has paid the Government as interest \u00a34264. The farmers on Aloomba Estate have earned \u00a330,000 from cane growing in the last two seasons. A similar and even better result was anticipated, if the tramway would have been extended to the Russell district, in conjunction with a central sugar-mill.<ref name=\"Trove\"/>\n\n=== Higher bridge ===\n[[File:Railway bridge over Babinda Creek on the Cairns-Mulgrave Line. The range in the background is Bellenden-Ker.jpg|thumb|Railway bridge over Babinda Creek on the Cairns-Mulgrave Line, 1912. The range in the background is [[Bellenden Ker]]]]\nThe Cairns Shire Council kept a boat at the Mulgrave River because the low-level bridge was regularly flooded. On one occasion, the engine was rushed through floodwaters, when the water was already over the bridge and high enough that it nearly put the fire out. In January 1907 the water level was up to {{convert|20|feet|m}} over the bridge. Thus a new bridge at a higher level was built over the Mulgrave River and completed in mid 1935. It was built to 12 ton axle load as part of the program to strengthen the line. Its completion enabled C16 and C17 class locomotives to operate between Cairns and Babinda instead of only PB15 and B15 class and lighter engines. Expenditure on the bridge and deviation in 1934-35 amounted to \u00a313,720. Although higher than the first bridge, the second bridge was still subject to frequent flooding. This curved wooden bridge was one of the last major river crossings on the North Coast Line, and has now been replaced by a third high level pre stressed concrete structure.<ref name=\"Elsmore\"/>\n\n=== Nationalisation ===\nOn 1 July 1911, the Queensland Government bought the line (including all inventories) from [[Cairns Shire Council]] for \u00a3158,650 and integrated it into the State Railway System. This line became the northernmost segment of the Sunshine Route.<ref name=\"Rohn\"/><ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/hist_act/ncrao19101gvn12317.pdf The North Coast Railway Act of 1910.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115001412/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/hist_act/ncrao19101gvn12317.pdf |date=2018-01-15 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of tramways in Queensland]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cairns-Mulgrave Tramway}}\n[[Category:Railway lines in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Transport in Cairns]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix placename links, replaced:Gladstone\u2192Gladstone,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns-Mulgrave_Tramway"}

Calling themselves the JJ O'Kellys they played matches against Mountrice, Eyrefield, Monasterevin, Kildare town and Milltown. In 1884, when the GAA was formed, the club changed its name from JJ O'Kelly's to Moorefield, the name of a townland in southern Newbridge.\n\n==Gaelic football==\nMoorefield beat Kilcullen in a one-sided county final in 1962, 2\u201311 to 0\u20132 to claim their first [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] title. Carbury defeated Moorefield in the 1965 final.\n\nMoorefield re-emerged in the 1990s. A run of success that started with the minor championship of 1989(Under the name Pollardstown) and two more Leinster Leader Cups in 1994 and 1996 culminated in three successive finals 2000\u20132002, two of which were won. In 2000 Moorefield beat [[Kilcock GAA|Kilcock]] by 2\u201313 to 2\u20137 after goals from Cian O'Neill and gave them a 2\u201310 to 0\u20131 lead at half-time. Sarsfields overhauled Moorefield towards the end of the 2001 final in a closely contested decider to win 0\u201310 to 0\u20138. In 2002 Moorefield won their third title, beating near neighbours Sarsfields 1\u20138 to 0\u20136 thanks to a Ronan Sweeney penalty seconds into the second half. Moorefield were defeated in two Leinster club semi-final, by O'Hanrahan's 0\u201312 to 0\u201311 in 2000 and by Mattock Rangers by 3\u201313 to 2\u201310 in 2002.\n\nThe glory days of Moorefield, and indeed Newbridge football rose to a higher plane in 2006, when The Moors beat [[Allenwood GAA|Allenwood]] in the [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] final, which lead on to a first [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] victory for the town, beating Rhode of [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] on a wind-swept Sunday in December in the aptly named [[O'Moore Park]], [[County Laois]]. They were decisive victors, on a day that all present hoped would lead to a clear-cut rather than a marginal victory. It proved to be so, with a final score of 3 goals and 6 points (15 points) to 8 points for Rhode.\n\nThe club enjoys a particularly bittersweet rivalry with town neighbours Sarsfields, and as their respective fortunes rise and fall each side can be trusted to support the other, and indeed enjoy each other's fortune. In 2007 they won the [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] for the second year running, beating Sarsfields.\n\nTheir football manager is Ross Glavin. In 2019 they were chasing an elusive three in a row senior championships, but as usual Sarsfields GAA stopped them achieving this feat.\n\nThe History of Moorefield gaa is well documented and can be viewed in two different documentaries about the club and its people, in \u2018Moorefield \u2018til I die\u2019 you can see how the hapless club run from one self destructive hazard to the next through mis-management and bad luck, in \u2018Benefits Street\u2019 you see how the club based in Pollardstown relies heavily on the riches of the nearby prosperous town of Newbridge, without these handouts Moorefield and its people would be considerably poor, ironically it is the riches of the better looking people from Sarsfields that keep this club in existence.

The replay was an entertaining and hard-fought game between both sides at St. Conleths park ending on a score of 1\u201311 a piece, leaving the title to be decided for a later date. On the day Moorefield dominated the majority of the game, Moorefield led 0\u201310 0\u201307 at the interval. A goal from a 21-yard free in front of the goal by Gavin Sunderland put the Moores 6 points in front midway through the 2nd half.

Calling themselves the JJ O'Kellys they played matches against Mountrice, Eyrefield, Monasterevin, Kildare town and Milltown. In 1884, when the GAA was formed, the club changed its name from JJ O'Kelly's to Moorefield, the name of a townland in southern Newbridge.\n\n==Gaelic football==\nMoorefield beat Kilcullen in a one-sided county final in 1962, 2\u201311 to 0\u20132 to claim their first [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] title. Carbury defeated Moorefield in the 1965 final.\n\nMoorefield re-emerged in the 1990s. A run of success that started with the minor championship of 1989(Under the name Pollardstown) and two more Leinster Leader Cups in 1994 and 1996 culminated in three successive finals 2000\u20132002, two of which were won. In 2000 Moorefield beat [[Kilcock GAA|Kilcock]] by 2\u201313 to 2\u20137 after goals from Cian O'Neill and gave them a 2\u201310 to 0\u20131 lead at half-time. Sarsfields overhauled Moorefield towards the end of the 2001 final in a closely contested decider to win 0\u201310 to 0\u20138. In 2002 Moorefield won their third title, beating near neighbours Sarsfields 1\u20138 to 0\u20136 thanks to a Ronan Sweeney penalty seconds into the second half. Moorefield were defeated in two Leinster club semi-final, by O'Hanrahan's 0\u201312 to 0\u201311 in 2000 and by Mattock Rangers by 3\u201313 to 2\u201310 in 2002.\n\nThe glory days of Moorefield, and indeed Newbridge football rose to a higher plane in 2006, when The Moors beat [[Allenwood GAA|Allenwood]] in the [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] final, which lead on to a first [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] victory for the town, beating Rhode of [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]] on a wind-swept Sunday in December in the aptly named [[O'Moore Park]], [[County Laois]]. They were decisive victors, on a day that all present hoped would lead to a clear-cut rather than a marginal victory. It proved to be so, with a final score of 3 goals and 6 points (15 points) to 8 points for Rhode.\n\nThe club enjoys a particularly bittersweet rivalry with town neighbours Sarsfields, and as their respective fortunes rise and fall each side can be trusted to support the other, and indeed enjoy each other's fortune. In 2007 they won the [[Kildare Senior Football Championship]] for the second year running, beating Sarsfields.\n\nTheir football manager is Ross Glavin. In 2019 they were chasing an elusive three in a row senior championships, but as usual Sarsfields GAA stopped them achieving this feat.\n\nThe History of Moorefield gaa is well documented and can be viewed in two different documentaries about the club and it\u2019s people, in \u2018Moorefield \u2018til I die\u2019 you can see how the hapless club run from one self destructive hazard to the next through mis-management and bad luck, in \u2018Benefits Street\u2019 you see how the club based in Pollardstown relies heavily on the riches of the nearby prosperous town of Newbridge, without these handouts Moorefield and its people would be considerably poor, ironically it is the riches of the better looking people from Sarsfields that keep this club in existence. Both documentaries show how Moorefield and it\u2019s members are just extremely jealous of Athy gfc.\n\n==Hurling==\nMoorefield's 1\u201310 to 0\u20133 victory over Broadford in the 1963 county final bridged a twenty-year gap for Moorefield.

Tucker, ''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, (2009), p. 477.</ref> \nSpanish forces, under [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], formed by 6,300 men, including 2,000 [[landsknecht]]e, with more than 1,000 [[arquebusiers]], and 20 cannons, defeated the French who had 9,000 men; mainly heavy [[gendarme]] cavalry and [[Swiss mercenary]] [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]], with about 40 cannons, and led by [[Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours]], who was killed.  It was one of the first European battles won by gunpowder weapons, as the assault by Swiss pikemen and French cavalry was shattered by the fire of Spanish arquebusiers behind a ditch.\n\n==Preparations==\nThe [[Second Italian War]] was re-kindled in late 1502, over disagreements on the Treaty of Granada of 11 November 1500. Although it was agreed that Louis XII should assume the [[Kingdom of Naples|throne of Naples]], Louis and the monarchs of Spain soon quarreled over the division of the rest of the spoils.  Soon war broke out again between France and Spain.<ref>Michael Mallett and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494\u20131559'', p. 61.</ref> \nThe Spanish forces, led by the \"Great Captain\" (''El Gran Capit\u00e1n'')  [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] avoided encounter with the enemy at first, hoping to lure the French into complacency.\nAfter a series of skirmishes, the Battle of Cerignola was the first major engagement in this phase of the war, alongside the [[Battle of Seminara (1503)|Battle of Seminara]] (Calabria) fought on the same day.\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba  had the numerical disadvantage but held the advantage of the terrain, being able to defend fortified high ground against the French assault. \nThe Spanish had occupied the heights of Cerignola, and de C\u00f3rdoba entrenched his soldiers with walls and stakes.\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's infantry was divided into a novel type of units called \"Coronel\u00edas,\" the immediate predecessor of the later [[Tercios]]. They were armed with a mix of pikes, arquebuses and swords. This type of formation had revolutionized the Spanish army, which like the French, had  centred on cavalry well into the 15th century, in the battles of the [[Reconquista]] against the Muslims in Spain.  \nIn front of the hillside, a trench was dug in which the arquebusiers took their positions. The Spanish artillery was placed on top of the hill among the vineyards, having a good view of the entire battlefield. The [[jinetes]], Spanish light cavalry, were placed in front of the rest of the army, while the Spanish heavy cavalry under Prospero Colonna were kept in reserve.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wojny w\u0142oskie 1494-1559 |last=Tafi\u0142owski |first=Piotr |year=2007 |publisher=Inforeditions |location=Zabrze |isbn=978-83-89943-18-7}}</ref>\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's troops faced a professional French army based on the ''Ordonnance'' reforms, relying on the heavily armoured cavalry of the ''Compagnies d'ordonnance'' and mercenary Swiss pikemen. This army also had more artillery than the Spanish, but the French artillery would not arrive in time to take active part in the battle.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe battle began with two charges by the French heavy cavalry against the centre of the Spanish army, but these were both dispersed by Spanish heavy artillery and [[arquebus]] fire. The next assault tried to force the right flank, but many of the French cavalrymen fell into the Spanish trench and the attack was then broken by a storm of fire from the Spanish arquebusiers. One of those killed by the arquebus volley was the French commander [[Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]], making him probably the first general killed in action by small arms fire.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} . With the Swiss commander, Chandieu, taking charge, the Swiss infantry attacked with the cavalry instead of waiting for the arrival of the French rear guard under Yves d'Al\u00e8gre. At the imminent assault upon the Spanish center the Spanish arquebusiers were withdrawn and the [[Landsknecht]]s sent forward.

Tucker, ''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', vol. 1, ABC-CLIO, (2009), p. 477.</ref> \nSpanish forces, under [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], formed by 6,300 men, including 2,000 [[landsknecht]]e, with more than 1,000 [[arquebusiers]], and 20 cannons, defeated the French who had 9,000 men; mainly heavy [[gendarme]] cavalry and [[Swiss mercenary]] [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]], with about 40 cannons, and led by [[Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours]], who was killed.  It was one of the first European battles won by gunpowder weapons, as the assault by Swiss pikemen and French cavalry was shattered by the fire of Spanish arquebusiers behind a ditch.\n\n==Preparations==\nThe [[Second Italian War]] was re-kindled in late 1502, over disagreements on the Treaty of Granada of 11 November 1500. Although it was agreed that Louis XII should assume the [[Kingdom of Naples|throne of Naples]], Louis and the monarchs of Spain soon quarreled over the division of the rest of the spoils.  Soon war broke out again between France and Spain.<ref>Michael Mallett and Christine Shaw, ''The Italian Wars: 1494\u20131559'', p. 61.</ref> \nThe Spanish forces, led by the \"Great Captain\" (''El Gran Capit\u00e1n'')  [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] avoided encounter with the enemy at first, hoping to lure the French into complacency.\nAfter a series of skirmishes, the Battle of Cerignola was the first major engagement in this phase of the war, alongside the [[Battle of Seminara (1503)|Battle of Seminara]] (Calabria) fought on the same day.\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba  had the numerical disadvantage but held the advantage of the terrain, being able to defend fortified high ground against the French assault. \nThe Spanish had occupied the heights of Cerignola, and de C\u00f3rdoba entrenched his soldiers with walls and stakes.\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's infantry was divided into a novel type of units called \"Coronel\u00edas,\" the immediate predecessor of the later [[Tercios]]. They were armed with a mix of pikes, arquebuses and swords. This type of formation had revolutionized the Spanish army, which like the French, had  centred on cavalry well into the 15th century, in the battles of the [[Reconquista]] against the Muslims in Spain.  \nIn front of the hillside, a trench was dug in which the arquebusiers took their positions. The Spanish artillery was placed on top of the hill among the vineyards, having a good view of the entire battlefield. The [[jinetes]], Spanish light cavalry, were placed in front of the rest of the army, while the Spanish heavy cavalry under Prospero Colonna were kept in reserve.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wojny w\u0142oskie 1494-1559 |last=Tafi\u0142owski |first=Piotr |year=2007 |publisher=Inforeditions |location=Zabrze |isbn=978-83-89943-18-7}}</ref>\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba's troops faced a professional French army based on the ''Ordonnance'' reforms, relying on the heavily armoured cavalry of the ''Compagnies d'ordonnance'' and mercenary Swiss pikemen. This army also had more artillery than the Spanish, but the French artillery would not arrive in time to take active part in the battle.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe battle began with two charges by the French heavy cavalry against the centre of the Spanish army, but these were both dispersed by Spanish heavy artillery and [[arquebus]] fire. The next assault tried to force the right flank, but many of the French cavalrymen fell into the Spanish trench and the attack was then broken by a storm of fire from the Spanish arquebusiers. One of those killed by the arquebus volley was the French commander [[Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]], making him probably the first general killed in action by small arms fire.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} . With the Swiss commander, Chandieu, taking charge, the Swiss infantry attacked with the cavalry instead of waiting for the arrival of the French rear guard under Yves d'Al\u00e8gre. At the imminent assault upon the Spanish center the Spanish arquebusiers were withdrawn and the [[Landsknecht]]s sent forward. The Swiss formations, soon joined by the Gascons, were unable to break into the defensive positions. Shot into the flank by the arquebusiers and harassed by the Spanish cavalry, the Swiss and French were driven back, taking heavy casualties including Chandieu.\n\nDe C\u00f3rdoba then called for a counterattack against the now disorganized enemy by both the Spanish infantry and the heavy Spanish cavalry waiting in reserve.

Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

For discussion see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref> In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a [[public park]].\n\n== Events and uses ==\n{{See also|Chariot racing|Ludi}}\n[[File:Plan Rome Caen Circus Maximus Colis\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Model of Rome in the 4th century AD, by [[Paul Bigot]]. The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1\u201313, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>\n\nDuring [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>\n\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T.

Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2\u20134.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour.

In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the foot ball Feld       was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date \u2013 as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia \u2013 replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65\u201366, 68\u201369}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Republican era ===\nThe games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely.

They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137\u2013138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era.

See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth.

Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely.

It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats.

He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile \u2013 A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72\u201373}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC\u2013AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268\u2013272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>\n[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]\nThe site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100\u2013101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=74}}</ref>\n\nThe risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Religious significance ==\n{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}\n\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\n\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201362}}. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, \"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252\u201367.</ref> The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.\n\n[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrier shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75.

Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201364, 92\u201394, 270\u2013273}}</ref>\n\nTemples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].\n\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\n\n== Modern status and uses ==\n[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6 meters beneath the modern surface.

Situated in the valley between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] hills, it was the first and largest stadium in [[ancient Rome]] and its later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

The Circus lies between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] (left) and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (right); the oval structure to the far right is the [[Colosseum]].]]\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for ''ludi,'' public games connected to [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious]] [[Roman festival|festivals]]. ''Ludi'' were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people (''populus Romanus'')]] and [[List of Roman deities|gods]]. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the [[Roman calendar]]. Others might be given to fulfill a [[Votum|religious vow]], such as the games in celebration of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal ''ludi'' at the Circus were [[Votum#Military vota|vowed]] by [[Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] to Jupiter in the [[Roman kingdom|late Regal era]] for his victory over [[Suessa Pometia|Pometia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n''Ludi'' ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|plays]] and recitals, [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] and [[gladiator]] fights. Some included public executions. The greater ''ludi'' (<ref>http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:ludus</ref>meaning sport or game in latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade ''([[pompa circensis]])'', much like the [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.<ref>Described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 7.72.1\u201313, supplemented by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]]'s history.</ref>\n\nDuring [[Roman Republic|Rome's Republican era]], the [[aedile]]s organised the games. The most costly and complex of the ''ludi'' offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|higher office]].<ref>Aedileship was a rung on the [[Cursus honorum|ladder of Roman politics]], available to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and [[plebs|plebeians]] of wealth and high standing. Despite the sometimes crippling personal cost of running for office and providing \"extras\" for the ''ludi'', a successful aedile could secure popular favor and a substantial share of the vote at election time. [[Julius Caesar]] was among those who solidified his support through his lavish ''ludi'' as aedile.</ref> Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"[[tibicen|flute players]], scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A ''[[venatio]]'' held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}, A later iron cage-work barrier is evident at [[Pompey]]'s ''venatione'' of 55 BC.</ref>\n\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing ''ludi'' were embellished and new ''ludi'' invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the [[Roman Republic#From the Gracchi to Caesar (133\u201349 BC)|late Republic]], ''ludi'' were held on 57 days of the year;<ref name=\"auto1\">Bunson, Matthew, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246.</ref> an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practice on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby [[Forum Boarium|cattle market]], just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of [[Catullus]] (mid-1st century BC) was likely \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=72}}, citing [[T.

Over the several centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the [[Colosseum]] had been built to host most of the city's [[gladiator]] shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed [[Stadium of Domitian]], though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus.<ref>Extraordinarily long races of up to 128 miles, if [[Pliny the Elder]] is to be believed; see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=71}}</ref> Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to ''ludi''.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale, and was the most popular venue for large-scale ''venationes'';<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> in the late 3rd century, the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=128}}, citing ''Historia Augusta'', Probus, 19.2\u20134.</ref> With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, ''ludi'' gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by [[Totila]] in 549.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowersock|first1=Glen Warren|last2=Brown|first2=Peter|last3=Grabar|first3=Oleg|title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World|url=https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-51173-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/lateantiquitygui00bowe/page/674 674]}}; citing Procopius, ''The Gothic Wars'', 3. 37. 4.For the last known beast-hunt at the Circus, see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=131}}.

In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river [[Tiber]] and the stream which divided the valley. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=11}}. Humphrey describes this as \"like a Greek [[hippodrome]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|history of Rome]], the first [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Roman Kingdom|king of Rome]] [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the [[equites]] and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, [[Tarquinius Superbus]], added the first seating for citizen-commoners ([[plebs]], or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track.<ref>The Aventine was a predominantly plebeian area.</ref> Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained<ref>Tarquin might have employed the plebs in constructing a conduit or drain (cloaca) for Murcia's stream, discharging into the Tiber. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=67}}</ref> but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (''metae''), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.<ref>Etruscan tomb paintings of chariot races offer a possible seating model for this earliest phase; noble sponsors and other dignitaries sit in elevated stands, complete with awning. Commoners lounge or sit below, at ground level. At the early Circus Maximus, the sloping ground afforded the possibility of turf seating tiers at an early date \u2013 as imagined by [[Ovid]] in his account of the first Consualia \u2013 replaced with wooden seating tiers by later sponsors and benefactors. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=65\u201366, 68\u201369}}, for early ''metae'' and a possible canal as central dividing barrier, see summary on pp. 292\u20133.</ref>\n\n=== Republican era ===\nThe games' sponsor (Latin ''editor)'' usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'') but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the [[Roman republic|Republican era]]) the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants were granted rights to a [[curule chair]] at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing.<ref>In the earliest exercise of the right, a curule chair would have been brought to the spot; its permanent positioning there is unlikely. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> In the 190s&nbsp;BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.<ref>Livy has the plebs seated \"promiscuously\" (''antea in promiscuo spectabant'') up to then: see {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=70}}</ref>\n\nPermanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted,<ref>Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 8.20.1</ref> and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots ( [[Quadriga]]s ) abreast but when team-racing was introduced,<ref>Racing teams might have been used as early as the Regal era (according to some later Roman traditions), or as late as the end of the Punic Wars.</ref> they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by [[herma|herms]] that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, [[Quadriga|four-horse]] or [[Biga (chariot)|two-horse chariots]] could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=171}}; the gates probably used the same animal-sinew torsion springing as the Roman [[ballista]]; ''Ibid'', pp. 137\u2013138: opposing teams of Reds and Whites are prominent in late Republican literature, and Greens and Blues in the Imperial era. Some Roman authors held that team-racing in multiple colors dated back to the regal era.

See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=69, 97ff}}</ref> The track measured approximately 621&nbsp;m (2,037&nbsp;ft) in length and 150&nbsp;m (387&nbsp;ft) in breadth. A&nbsp;canal was cut between the track perimeter and its seating to protect spectators and help drain the track.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=75, 84}}</ref> The inner third of the seating formed a trackside ''[[cavea]]''. Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for ''equites''. The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Circus-Maximus|title=Circus Maximus arena, Rome, Italy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[Pliny the Elder]]'s estimate of 250,000 is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31&nbsp;BC, either during or after construction.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]]'s figure of 250,000 circus seats is unreliable; it ignores the necessary interruptions of seating rows by many access stairways and corridors. It might represent a per foot run seating estimate, or include those watching from the nearby heights, outside the building proper. In late Imperial regionary catalogues, seating estimates for the Circus become even wilder; one gives an impossible 450,000 seats. Discussion is in {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=126}}</ref>\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n[[File:Sestertius Trajan Circus Maximus AD103.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sestertius of Trajan celebrating the restoration of the Circus Maximus (minted 103 AD).<ref>Sear, David R.

London: Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-45-7}}</ref>]]\n\nThe fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and ''pulvinar'' at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods.<ref>It was quarried and first dedicated in the reign of [[Seti I]]</ref> Augustus had it brought from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=Mysteries of the Nile \u2013 A World of Obelisks: Rome|website=NOVA Online}}</ref> at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#pulvinar|pulvinar]]'' was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]'') raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=72\u201373}}. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] described the Circus and its seating c.30 BC\u2013AD 8. Augustus also rebuilt Ceres' temple, above the starting gates; it was probably damaged in the fire of 31 BC. ''Ibid,'' pp. 268\u2013272 for Augustus' obelisk.</ref>\n[[File:Topographical diagram of the Circus Maximus by Samuel Ball Platner.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Groundplan of the Circus Maximus, according to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], 1911. The staggered starting gates are to the left.]]\nThe site remained prone to flooding,<ref>The ''Ludi Martiales'' of AD 12 were temporarily transferred from the Circus, after a flood.</ref> probably through the starting gates, until [[Claudius]] made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor [[Tiberius]] compensated various small businesses there for their losses.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=100\u2013101}}. Claudius' improvements at the Circus included stone-built or marble-clad starting stalls and rebuilt turning posts.</ref> In [[Great Fire of Rome|AD 64]], during [[Nero]]'s reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.<ref>Nero, inordinately fond of chariot-racing, may have considered the Circus rebuilding a priority but the overall cost of Rome's rebuilding must have proved an extraordinary drain on Imperial and public funds. Wooden bleachers for the Roman masses were an expedient, cost-effective solution. If Nero had grander plans for the Circus, they ended with his suicide under compulsion, after a coup d'etat in AD 68. {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring [[Titus]] at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance.<ref>This is not to be confused with the [[Arch of Titus]], built over the [[Via Sacra]] on the opposite side of the Palatine.</ref> The emperor [[Domitian]] built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=74}}</ref>\n\nThe risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted [[Trajan]]'s decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under [[Caracalla]], and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in [[Diocletian]]'s reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=80, 102, 126\u20139}}</ref>\n\n== Religious significance ==\n{{Wide image|Circus Maximus in Rome.jpg|900px|The Circus Maximus site and the Palatine Hill in background|box width|center|alt=alt text}}\n\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, located at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess [[Murcia (mythology)|Murcia]], an obscure deity associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Myrtus|myrtle]] shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill.<ref>The prestige attached to the [[curule chair]] granted [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] and his descendants in 494 BC would have been enhanced by its positioning close to this shrine. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=61}}</ref> The other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to [[Consus]], a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and to the [[underworld]]. According to Roman tradition, [[Romulus]] discovered this shrine shortly after the [[founding of Rome]]. He invented the [[Consualia]] festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then [[bride abduction|abducted]] the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] of the [[Rape of the Sabine women]] had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\n\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and [[Hercules]]' [[Ara Maxima]], supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}</ref> The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s Greek equivalent, [[Poseidon]], in Greek [[hippodrome]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=62}}; \"later Roman authors often reported the Consualia were held in honour of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptunus Equestris]].\"</ref> In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' [[tutelary deity|patron deities]], was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the ''spina'' or ''euripus'')<ref>Most modern sources use ''spina'' (a spine) for the central barrier, based on a single, very late Roman source ([[Cassiodorus]]), but most Roman sources used ''euripus'', a Greek word meaning a channel, strait, or canal, and thus a barrier. See {{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|p=175}}</ref> between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as ''Vallis Murcia''.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201362}}. For Murcia's shifting topographical associations, see Otto Skutsch, \"Enniana IV: Condendae urbis auspicia\", ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Nov., 1961), pp. 252\u201367.</ref> The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; [[Castor and Pollux]], who were [[Leda (mythology)|born from an egg]], were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the [[equestrian order]] ''(equites)''. Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune]], as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.<ref name=\"auto2\" /> When the Romans adopted the Phrygian [[Magna Mater|Great Mother]] as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.\n\n[[File:Roman - Intaglio of a Circus with a Chariot Race - Walters 421314.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Jasper]] [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]] (2nd century AD) depicting chariot races, with the three-pointed  ''metae'' at each end of the dividing barrier shown at top ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and solar monism as a theological basis for the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman Imperial cult]]. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred [[obelisk]] towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.  The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (''[[quadriga]]'') through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]''); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track.<ref>Jean Sorabella, \"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron\", ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'', Vol. 36, (2001), p. 75. See also Doro Levi, \"Aion\", ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', Vol. 13, 4, 1944, pp. 287ff.</ref> In Imperial cosmology, the emperor was Sol-Apollo's earthly equivalent, and Luna may have been linked to the empress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<!-- Emperor and Sol is covered by Humphrey but no RS as yet for Luna's Imperial equivalence in the reigning empress. Severan (Julia Domna) coins sorta suggest it but could equally show Cybele  --> Luna's temple, built long before Apollo's, burned down in the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64 AD]] and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with [[Sol Indiges]], usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphrey|1986|pp=61\u201364, 92\u201394, 270\u2013273}}</ref>\n\nTemples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to [[Temple of Luna|Luna]], the moon goddess. Aventine temples to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Obsequens]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]] (or perhaps [[Summanus]]) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to [[Temple of Cybele (Palatine)|Magna Mater]] and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus|Apollo]].\n\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the [[Cerealia]], the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" ''([[Ludi Romani]])'' held at the Circus in honour of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in 366 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56.</ref> In the early Imperial era, [[Ovid]] describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus,<ref>Wiseman, 1995, p.137.</ref> followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches.<ref>See [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth, Barbette Stanley]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\n\n== Modern status and uses ==\n[[File:Circus-Maximus-June-1983.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins overlooking the Circus Maximus, seen from the Aventine (1983)]]\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay, and was quarried for building materials. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried 6 meters beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was \"replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.\"<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Choay, (Trans. Lauren M.

It is often used for concerts and meetings. The [[Live 8 concert, Rome|Rome concert of Live 8]] (July 2, 2005) was held there. The English band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] performed a concert before an estimated audience of 500,000 people in 2007 (this was filmed and released as [[When in Rome 2007]]). [[The Rolling Stones]] played there in front of 71,527 people on June 22, 2014 for the Italian date of their [[14 On Fire]] tour. The Circus has also hosted victory celebrations, following the Italian [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] victory and the [[A.S. Roma]] [[Serie A]] victory in 1983 and 2001. In May 2019, a new [[virtual reality|virtual]]/[[augmented reality]] experience, the ''Circo Maximo Experience'', opened on the site, taking visitors on a journey through the site and its history.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Horses|Sports}}\n* [[Amphitheatre]]\n* [[Forma Urbis Romae]]\n* [[List of closed stadia by capacity]]\n* [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Humphrey|first=John H.|title=Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=couetXBQO9AC|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04921-5}}\n\n== External links ==\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Thra4T80c)- AP Archive.

Dalyngrigge returned to England in 1377 having accumulated much wealth and power.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=9, 11}}</ref> Upon his return to Sussex, he married Elizabeth, the heiress of the Wardedieu or Wardeux family, who had held the manor of [[Bodiam]] since before 1330. Through his new wife, Sir Edward acquired a moated manor house, which lay just to the north of Bodiam church. It is also possible that Dalyngrigge and his new wife resided in this manor house until his new castle was completed, although he also held another house at his estate at Bolebrook, near [[Hartfield, Sussex]].\n\n==Knighthood==\nBetween 1379 and 1388, Dalyngrigge was [[Knight of the Shire]] of Sussex in ten parliaments and subsequently one of the most influential gentry of the county at that time. In 1380 he was made a member of the Commission considering the state of the realm and the possessions, expenses and revenues of the royal household. Also in that year, he was appointed to survey [[Winchelsea]] and to consider how the town should be fortified against attacks from the French. His concern over the defence of the coast was evident in 1384-5, when he was called to be a member of a Commission to fortify the cinque port, [[Rye, East Sussex]].\n\nIn 1384 the King's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], took out a lawsuit against Dalyngrigge to try to restrain him from interference with the Duke's recently acquired Sussex estates. Resentment of the powerful Duke of Lancaster and his estates was felt by many of the Sussex gentry, and Dalyngrigge was essentially representing their grievances. Dalyngrigge's behaviour in court, where he appeared in his own defence, was violent and unruly and gives a good indication of his personality; twice during the proceedings, he threw down the gauntlet in court. His action seems to imply that he saw the case more as a matter of honour than of legality. His concern was fundamentally that his local standing was threatened by John of Gaunt's acquisition and authority over neighbouring estates. John of Gaunt won his lawsuit and Dalyngrigge suffered an almost \u00a31000 fine for contempt and was ordered to be kept in 'safe and secure custody' of the sheriff until paid. Sir Edward's patron, the 11th [[Earl of Arundel]], was able to intercede for him with the King after the Duke had departed England on 9 July 1386 when he sailed his army to Brest and on to Corunna and so Dalyngrigge was returned to the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] soon after without ever paying the fine.\n\nEngland had been at war with France on-and-off since the 1330s when King Edward III laid claim to the French throne. Due to a number of attacks by the French on towns on the southern English coast, there was a good reason for building a well-defended castle close to the south coast. At the time, the [[River Rother (Eastern)|River Rother]] was still navigable as far as Bodiam and the French could have easily have sailed an invading or raiding force there. Consequently, King Richard II issued a Royal Licence to Dalyngrigge in October 1385 to [[crenelation|crenellate]] his manor house at Bodiam. The licence, in Latin, stated:\n{{quote|...that he may strengthen with a wall of stone and lime, and crenellate and may construct and make into a Castle his manor house of Bodyham, near the sea, in the county of Sussex, for the defence of the adjacent country [France], and the resistance of our enemies.}}\nIn addition to the [[licence to crenellate]], Sir Edward was granted a royal licence to divert a stream from \"Dalyngreggesbay\", upstream in Saleshurst, to Bodiam to power a [[watermill]]. The mill was situated to the south of the site for Sir Edward's new castle between the castle and the River Rother, fed by a large mill-pond.\n\nIn 1386-7, Sir Edward was appointed Captain of Brest, and due to his having to spend his time in France is unlikely to have been present to oversee the first stages of his new castle.\n\nBy 1390 the threat of war with France had receded. Sir Edward was appointed to several commissions, such as to conclude a truce with France, to make conditions with the [[Philip the Bold|Count of Flanders]] and with the people of [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ypres]], and to survey the castles and fortresses of [[Calais]] and [[Picardy]]. In 1390 he was one of the nine knights who attached their seal to a letter sent to the Pope deploring the excesses of the Church.{{fact|date=November 2015}} Sir Edward's status in the country was further reflected in 1392 when he was appointed as [[Lord Mayor of London|Warden of London]] by King Richard II when civic liberties were suspended from May to September of that year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henry Yevele c.1320\u20131400|author=John Hooper Harvey|page=46|author-link=John Hooper Harvey}}</ref>\n\nBy the time his castle at Bodiam was completed in about 1390, Dalyngrigge did not have long to enjoy it, as he died some time between July 1393 and August 1394.<ref>Spencer, Dan (2014), [http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume6/Edward_Dallingridge_Builder_of_Bodiam_Castle.pdf \"Edward Dallinbridge: Builder of Bodiam Castle\"], p. 11</ref> \n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Sir John Dalyngrigge, who was married to Alice, daughter and heir of Sir John Beauchamp of [[Powick]], and relict of Sir Thomas Butler of Sudeley, Gloucestershire.<ref>L.S.
