Kirk (William Shatner) first appeared in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and has been portrayed in numerous films, books, comics, webisodes, and video games. As the captain of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']], Kirk leads his crew as they explore new worlds, new civilizations, and \"[[where no man has gone before|boldly go where no man has gone before]]\". Often, the characters of [[Spock]] and [[Leonard McCoy]] act as his logical and emotional sounding boards, respectively.\n\nKirk, played by [[William Shatner]], first appears in ''Star Trek'''s first episode, \"[[The Man Trap]]\", broadcast on September 8, 1966. Shatner continued in the role for the show's three seasons, and later provided the voice of the animated version of Kirk in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973\u20131974). Shatner returned to the role for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and in six subsequent films. [[Chris Pine]] portrays an alternative young version of the character in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film. Pine reprised his role in ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and in ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016). Other actors have played the character in fan-created media, and the character has been the subject of multiple [[Parody|spoofs]] and satires.\n\n==Depiction==\nJames Tiberius Kirk was born in [[Riverside, Iowa]], on March 22, 2233,<ref name=\"Star Trek Chronology The History of the Future\">{{cite book|title=Star Trek Chronology The History of the Future|last=Okuda|first=Michael|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1993|location=1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY. 10011|pages=29, 184|authorlink=Michael Okuda}}</ref> where he was raised by his parents, George and Winona Kirk.<ref>{{cite book |title=Best Destiny |authorlink=Diane Carey |first=Diane |last=Carey |page=[https://archive.org/details/bestdestiny00care/page/38 38] |quote=George and Winona Kirk, and their boys, George Samuel, Junior, and James Tiberius |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-671-79588-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/bestdestiny00care/page/38 }}</ref> Although born on Earth, Kirk lived for a time on [[The Conscience of the King (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Tarsus IV]], where he was one of nine surviving witnesses to the massacre of 4,000 colonists by [[The Conscience of the King (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Kodos the Executioner]].

It is the third such temple that has been built in [[Illinois]] (the [[Nauvoo Temple|original Nauvoo Temple]] and [[Chicago Illinois Temple]] being the others).\n\n==History==\nLocated in the town of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], the temple's construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000. The structure itself was built in the [[Greek Revival]] architectural style using limestone block quarried in [[Russellville, Alabama]]. It is built in the same location as the [[Nauvoo Temple|original structure]] that was dedicated in 1846.\n\nThe origins of the temple go back to 1937. In that year, Wilford C. Wood purchased some of the land on behalf of the LDS Church and purchased another piece of land that he later sold to the church. He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]], co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[https://rsc.byu.edu/es/archived/nauvoo-temple-story-faith/13-temple-rebuilt Don F. Colvin. ''Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith''. BYU Religious Studies Center, Chapter 13]</ref>\n\nWood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed the purchase of the temple lot.<ref>Colvin, ''Nauvoo Temple''</ref>\n\n==Exterior design and decoration==\nThe building measures {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|162|ft|m}} tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni.  It has an area of {{convert|54000|sqft|m2}}.  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the [[Kirtland Temple]] also has a bell tower. The temple spire is surmounted by a statue of the [[angel Moroni]] in standing position covered in gold leaf, following the pattern of the statue on the Salt Lake temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weather vane, sculpted in tin and covered in gold. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying. Clothed in a robe and cap, the angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.  \n\nChurch leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the [[Nauvoo Temple|19th-century temple]], which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.\n\n==Interior design and decoration==\nThe interior floor plan of the temple is noticeably different from its predecessor. The endowment ceremony assumed its present form in the original structure. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces that were used to administer the Endowment ordinances. One of the canvas \"rooms\" was decorated with potted plants to suggest the Garden of Eden. The Salt Lake City [[Endowment House]] and early Utah temples followed this pattern. They had a series of four rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, in succession, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but did not have murals on the walls. The [[Los Angeles Temple]], dedicated in 1956, was the last temple with this pattern until the reconstruction of the Nauvoo Illinois temple. After the Los Angeles temple, temples presented the endowment in one or two rooms without murals adorning the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the [[Columbia River Washington Temple]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple is the sole exception to this pattern, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms. \n\nThe completion and official dedication took place on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of [[Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.\n\nUp to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= August 22, 2006 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher.

There were, however, some special edition models, most notably the RS model of the 1987 model year, available only in white body color with [[pewter]] color trim, and featuring the stiffest suspension available on any Impulse, very close to the Irmscher suspension sold only in Japan.

These cars were sold by Alan Day at significantly reduced price; the main reason Isuzu GB went out of business was due to high unit price. In 1987 International Motors Group of West Bromwich (IM Group) were awarded the official Isuzu franchise for the UK.

IM Group still marketed the Piazza in single trim/engine form, but they only sold the updated 'Lotus' Piazza. The earlier cars sold by Day became known as 'pre-Lotus' cars; the suspension and handling of these pre-Lotus cars was derided by UK Press as poor, especially the [[live axle]] arrangement at the rear, which by the late '80s was seen to be antiquated. The updated 'Handling by Lotus' car was available from 1987 and the handling, although keeping the live axle arrangement, was transfomed by Lotus in the UK after significant development work, involving modified suspension layouts, larger brakes, specially produced dampers and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres. The 'Handling by Lotus' cars had updated interior and exterior equipment. The exterior having a redesigned rear, with a large 'hoop' spoiler, new rear lamps, new rear badging with 'Handling by Lotus' badges and removal of the rubber side bumper strakes for a cleaner, more modern look. The updated interior trim was mainly 'tweed' check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market.\n\n[[File:Holden YB Piazza.JPG|thumb|right|The Piazza was marketed in Australia as the YB series Holden Piazza]]\nIsuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD [[Isuzu Trooper]].

GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Spectrum|Spectrum]], this time a sportier model called the [[Geo Storm|Storm]] ([[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini Coupe]] in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from [[GM Europe]]'s design submission for the [[Lotus Elan M100]].<ref name=\"lotussincethe70sbook\">Robinson, Graham.

Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the lozenge theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the \"European look\", which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan.\n\nThe three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6&nbsp;L (1588&nbsp;cc) I4 engine which produced 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) and 102&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (138&nbsp;Nm). The suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a [[multi-link suspension|multi-link]] rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|passive steering]].\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and 150&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (203&nbsp;Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8&nbsp;L (1809&nbsp;cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) and 125&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (169&nbsp;Nm).<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpji.html|title=Impulse JI and Asuna Sunfire Specifications|accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced.\n\nSince the Impulse weighed just 2411&nbsp;lb (1094&nbsp;kg) in front-wheel drive configuration and 2732&nbsp;lb (1239&nbsp;kg) in all-wheel drive configuration, the turbo engine and all-wheel drive combined gave excellent performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nGeneral Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned [[Lotus Cars]] at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the [[Lotus Elan M100]] and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension.\n\nA non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.\n\nThe combination of the burst of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]], rising [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Automobile safety|crash safety]] requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse.\n\n[[File:'93 Asuna Sunfire.JPG|thumb|left|1993 [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire]]\nIn the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the [[Geo Storm]] version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA-Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan.\n\nIn [[Canada]], the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8&nbsp;L model was sold in Canada as the [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire, but only with the [[hatchback]] body.<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\" /> With the phaseout of the As\u00fcna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a [[Pontiac]], as [[Pontiac Sunfire|its version]] of the third-generation [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] on the [[GM J platform]] rather than an Isuzu platform.\n\nThe second generation Piazza was replaced by the [[Opel Vectra]] based [[Holden Calibra]] in Australia.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Isuzu Piazza}}\n* [http://www.isuzupiazza.com/ IsuzuPiazza.com]\u2014 Isuzu Piazza Online Community\n* [http://www.iptoc.com/ Isuzu Piazza Turbo Owners' Club (IPTOC)] (Great Britain)\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Piazza]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Hatchbacks]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1980]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Isuzu Piazza\n| image = File:1987 ISUZU Piazza 2.0 Turbo.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[Isuzu Motors]]\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Isuzu Motors#Japan|Fujisawa Plant]], [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]], [[Japan]]\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| predecessor = [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]] coup\u00e9<br />3-door [[station wagon]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Isuzu Piazza''' is a small, sporty 3-door [[liftback]] [[coup\u00e9]] which was manufactured by [[Isuzu]] from 1981 to 1992 in two generations.

The updated interior trim was mainly 'tweed' check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market.\n\n[[File:Holden YB Piazza.JPG|thumb|right|The Piazza was marketed in Australia as the YB series Holden Piazza]]\nIsuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD [[Isuzu Trooper]]. They never sold the second generation Piazza in the UK, nor was it sold in any European market.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the Piazza was introduced very late (April 1986), and offered only in Turbo form.<ref name=\"holdenbook\">Bebbington, Terry, and Michel A.

GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Spectrum|Spectrum]], this time a sportier model called the [[Geo Storm|Storm]] ([[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini Coupe]] in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from [[GM Europe]]'s design submission for the [[Lotus Elan M100]].<ref name=\"lotussincethe70sbook\">Robinson, Graham.

Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the lozenge theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the \"European look\", which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan.\n\nThe three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6&nbsp;L (1588&nbsp;cc) I4 engine which produced 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) and 102&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (138&nbsp;Nm). The suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a [[multi-link suspension|multi-link]] rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|passive steering]].\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and 150&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (203&nbsp;Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8&nbsp;L (1809&nbsp;cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) and 125&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (169&nbsp;Nm).<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpji.html|title=Impulse JI and Asuna Sunfire Specifications|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced.\n\nSince the Impulse weighed just 2411&nbsp;lb (1094&nbsp;kg) in front-wheel drive configuration and 2732&nbsp;lb (1239&nbsp;kg) in all-wheel drive configuration, the turbo engine and all-wheel drive combined gave excellent performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nGeneral Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned [[Lotus Cars]] at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the [[Lotus Elan M100]] and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension.\n\nA non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.\n\nThe combination of the burst of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]], rising [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Automobile safety|crash safety]] requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse.\n\n[[File:'93 Asuna Sunfire.JPG|thumb|left|1993 [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire]]\nIn the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the [[Geo Storm]] version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA-Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan.\n\nIn [[Canada]], the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8&nbsp;L model was sold in Canada as the [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire, but only with the [[hatchback]] body.<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\" /> With the phaseout of the As\u00fcna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a [[Pontiac]], as [[Pontiac Sunfire|its version]] of the third-generation [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] on the [[GM J platform]] rather than an Isuzu platform.\n\nThe second generation Piazza was replaced by the [[Opel Vectra]] based [[Holden Calibra]] in Australia.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Isuzu Piazza}}\n* [http://www.isuzupiazza.com/ IsuzuPiazza.com]\u2014 Isuzu Piazza Online Community\n* [http://www.iptoc.com/ Isuzu Piazza Turbo Owners' Club (IPTOC)] (Great Britain)\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Piazza]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Hatchbacks]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1980]]\n", "name_user": "Davey2010", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu_Piazza"}
