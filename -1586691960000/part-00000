Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family were to later settle in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported the Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family were to later settle in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported the Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Venizelos had such profound influence on the internal and external affairs of Greece that he is credited with being \"the maker of modern Greece\",<ref>Duffield J. W., The New York Times, 30 October 1921, Sunday [https://www.nytimes.com/1921/10/30/archives/venizelos-maker-of-modern-greece.html link]</ref> and is still widely known as the \"[[Ethnarch]]\".\n\nHis first entry into the international scene was with his significant role in the autonomy of the [[Cretan State]] and later in the union of [[Crete]] with Greece. Soon, he was invited to Greece to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. Not only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both army and navy in preparation of future conflicts. Before the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, Venizelos' catalytic role helped gain Greece entrance to the [[Balkan League]], an alliance of the Balkan states against the Ottoman Empire. Through his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled its area and population with the liberation of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and most of the [[Aegean islands]].\n\nIn World War I (1914\u20131918), he brought Greece on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], further expanding the Greek borders. However, his pro-Allied foreign policy brought him into direct conflict with [[Constantine I of Greece]], causing the [[National Schism]]. The Schism polarized the population between the [[Monarchism|royalists]] and [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] and the struggle for power between the two groups affected the political and social life of Greece for decades.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1612186 |title=Intrigue in Greece. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=4 July 1916 |accessdate=29 November 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  Following the Allied victory, Venizelos secured new territorial gains, especially in [[Anatolia]], coming close to realizing the ''[[Megali Idea]]''. Despite his achievements, he was defeated in the 1920 General Election, which contributed to the eventual Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]]. Venizelos, in self-imposed exile, represented Greece in the negotiations that led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], and the agreement of a mutual exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey.\n\nIn his subsequent periods in office, Venizelos succeeded in restoring normal relations with Greece's neighbors and expanded his constitutional and economical reforms. In 1935 he resurfaced from retirement to support a military coup. Its failure severely weakened the [[Second Hellenic Republic]].\n\n==Origins and early years==\n\n===Ancestors===\n[[File:Venizelos House Mournies.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The house of Venizelos in Mournies.]]\n\nIn the 18th century, the ancestors of Venizelos, named Cravvatas, lived in [[Mystras]], in southern [[Peloponnese]]. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] raids in the peninsula in 1770, a member of the Cravvatas family, Venizelos Cravvatas, the youngest of several brothers, managed to escape to [[Crete]] where he established himself. His sons discarded their patronymic and called themselves Venizelos.

In 1881 he enrolled at the [[University of Athens]] Law School and got his degree in Law with excellent grades. He returned to Crete in 1886 and worked as a lawyer in Chania. Throughout his life he maintained a passion for reading and was constantly improving his skills in English, Italian, German, and French.<ref name=\"Chester4\"/>\n\n===Entry into politics===\nThe situation in Crete during Venizelos' early years was fluid. The [[Ottoman empire]] was undermining the reforms, which were made under international pressure, while the Cretans desired to see the Sultan, [[Abdul Hamid II]], abandon \"the ungrateful infidels\".<ref name=\"Ion277\">Ion, 1910, p. 277</ref> Under these unstable conditions Venizelos entered into politics in the elections of 2 April 1889 as a member of the island's liberal party.<ref name=\"SI1\"/> As a deputy he was distinguished for his eloquence and his radical opinions.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 45, 47</ref>\n\n==Political career in Crete==\n{{See also|History of Crete}}\n\n===Cretan uprising===\n\n====Background====\nThe numerous revolutions in Crete, during and after the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821, 1833, 1841, 1858, 1866, 1878, 1889, 1895, 1897)<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 16</ref> were the result of the Cretans' desire for Enosis \u2014 Union with Greece.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 65</ref> In the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan revolution of 1866]], the two sides, under the pressure of the [[Great Powers]], came to an agreement, which was finalized in the [[Pact of Halepa|Pact of Chalepa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Later the Pact was included in the provisions of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which was supplementing previous concessions granted to the Cretans \u2014 e.g. the Organic Law Constitution (1868) designed by [[William James Stillman]]. In summary the Pact was granting a large degree of self-government to Greeks in Crete as a means of limiting their desire to rise up against their [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman overlords]].<ref name=\"BR1\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pact of Halepa | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008  |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038873 }}</ref> However the [[Cretan Turks|Muslims of Crete]], who identified with Ottoman Empire, were not satisfied with these reforms, as in their view the  administration of the island was delivered to the hands of the Christian Greek population. In practice, the Ottoman Empire failed to enforce the provisions of the Pact, thus fueling the existing tensions between the two communities; instead, the Ottoman authorities attempted to maintain order by the dispatching of substantial military reinforcements during 1880\u20131896. Throughout that period, the ''Cretan Question'' was a major issue of friction in the relations of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|independent Greece]] with the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn January 1897 violence and disorder were escalating on the island, thus polarizing the population.

A Greek force of about 2,000 men had landed at [[Kolymbari]] on 3 February 1897,<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 62</ref> and its commanding officer, Colonel [[Timoleon Vassos]] declared that he was taking over the island \"in the name of the [[George I of Greece|King of the Hellenes]]\" and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece.<ref>Kerofilias, 1915, p. 14</ref> This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers decided to blockade Crete with their fleets and land their troops, thus stopping the Greek army from approaching Chania.<ref name=\"Dunningp367\">Dunning, Jun. 1987, p. 367</ref>\n\n====Events at Akrotiri====\n[[File:Venizelos at Akrotiri.jpg|thumb|220px|Venizelos at Akrotiri, 1897.]]\n\nVenizelos, at that time, was in an electoral tour of the island. Once, he \"saw Canea in flames\",<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 35\u201336</ref> he hurried to [[Malaxa, Crete|Malaxa]], near Chania, where a group of about 2,000 rebels had assembled, and established himself as their header. He proposed an attack, along with other rebels, on the Turkish forces at [[Akrotiri (Crete)|Akrotiri]] in order to displace them from the plains (Malaxa is in a higher altitude). Venizelos' subsequent actions at Akrotiri form a central set-piece in his myth. People composed poems on Akrotiri and his role there; editorials and articles spoke about his bravery, his visions and his diplomatic genius as inevitable accompaniment of later greatness.<ref name=\"Kitromilides.p58\"/> Venizelos spent the night in Akrotiri and a [[Greek flag]] was raised. The [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman forces]] requested help from the foreign admirals and attacked the rebels, with the ships of the Great Powers bombarding the rebel positions at Akrotiri. A shell threw down the flag, which was raised up again immediately. The mythologizing became more pronounced when we come to his actions in that February, as the following quotes display:\n\n{{cquote|On 20th of February [he] was ordered by the admirals to lower the flag and disband his rebel force. He refused!<ref>Gibbons, p. 24</ref> }}\n\n{{cquote|Venizelos turned towards to the port of [[Souda]], where the warships were anchored and explained: \"You have cannon-balls \u2013 fire away!

He wrote that the rebels would keep their positions until everyone is killed from the shells of European warships, in order not to let the Turks remain in Crete.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 63\u201364</ref> The letter was deliberately leaked to international newspapers, evoking emotional reactions in Greece and in Europe, where the idea of Christians, who wanted their freedom, being bombarded by Christian vessels, caused popular indignation. Throughout western Europe much popular sympathy for the cause of the Christians in Crete was manifested, and much popular applause was bestowed on the Greeks.<ref name=\"Dunningp367\"/>\n\n====War in Thessaly====\n{{details|Greco-Turkish War (1897)}}\n[[File:Balkans-ethnique.JPG|right|thumb|Ethnic composition of the Balkans according to the Atlas G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vidal-Lablache, Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1898.]]\n[[File:Edward Stanford 1877.jpg|right|thumb|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] by the Greek diplomat Ioannis Gennadius,<ref>Understanding life in the borderlands: boundaries in depth and in motion, I.

Even though no progress was made at the meeting, he persuaded the admirals to send him on a tour of the island, under their protection, in order to explore the people's opinions on the question of autonomy versus union.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 65</ref> At the time, the majority of the Cretan population initially supported the union, but the subsequent events in Thessaly turned the public opinion towards autonomy as an intermediate step.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, the Ottomans had relocated a significant part of their army in the Balkans to the north of [[Thessaly]], close to the borders with Greece.<ref>Rose, 1897, pp. 2\u20133</ref> Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces, who were members of the ''[[Ethniki Etairia]]'' (followers of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'') acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts,<ref>Dunning, June 1897, p. 368</ref> leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece on 17 April. The war was a disaster for Greece. The Turkish army was better prepared, in large part due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Baron von der Goltz]], and the [[Greek army]] was in retreat within weeks.

On 27 April 1899, the High Commissioner created an Executive Committee composed of the Cretan leaders. Venizelos became minister of Justice and with the rest of the Committee, they began to organize the State and create a \"Cretan constitution\". Venizelos insisted to not be made reference on religion, so all the residents of Crete to feel represented. For his stance was later accused as pro-Turk (pro-Muslim) by his political opponents on the island.\n\nAfter Venizelos submitted the complete juridical legislation on 18 May 1900, disagreements between him and Prince George began to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Prince George decided to travel to Europe and announced to the Cretan population that \"When I am traveling in Europe I shall ask the Powers for annexation, and I hope to succeed on account of my family connections\".<ref name=\"Kerofiliasp30-31\">Kerofilias, 1915, pp. 30\u201331</ref> The statement reached the public without the knowledge or approval of the Committee. Venizelos said to the Prince that it would not be proper to give hope to the population for something that wasn't feasible at the given moment. As Venizelos had expected, during the Prince's journey, the Great Powers rejected his request.<ref name=\"SU2\"/><ref name=\"Kerofiliasp30-31\"/>\n\nThe disagreements continued on other topics; the Prince wanted to build a palace, but Venizelos strongly opposed it as that would mean perpetuation of the current arrangement of Governorship; Cretans accepted it only as temporary, until a final solution was found.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> Relations between the two men became increasingly soured, and Venizelos repeatedly submitted his resignation.<ref>Kerofilias, 1915, p. 33</ref>\n\nIn a meeting of the Executive Committee, Venizelos expressed his opinion that the island was not in essence autonomous, since militarily forces of the Great Powers were still present, and that the Great Powers were governing through their representative, the Prince. Venizelos suggested that once the Prince's service expired, then the Great Powers should be invited to the Committee, which, according to article 39 of the constitution (which was suppressed in the conference of Rome) would elect a new sovereign, thereby removing the need for the presence of the Great Powers. Once the Great Powers' troops left the island along with their representatives, then the union with Greece would be easier to achieve. This proposal was exploited by Venizelos' opponents, who accused him that he wanted Crete as an autonomous hegemony. Venizelos replied to the accusations by submitting once again his resignation, with the reasoning that for him it would be impossible henceforth to collaborate with the Committee's members; he assured the Commissioner however that he did not intend to join the opposition.<ref name=\"SU2\"/>\n\nOn 6 March 1901, in a report, he exposed the reasons that compelled him to resign to the High Commissioner, which was however leaked to the press. On 20 March, Venizelos was dismissed, because \"he, without any authorization, publicly supported opinions opposite of those of the Commissioner\".<ref name=\"SU2\"/><ref>Chester, 1921, p. 82</ref> Henceforth, Venizelos assumed the leadership of the opposition to the Prince. For the next three years, he carried out a hard political conflict, until the administration was virtually paralyzed and tensions dominated the island. Inevitably, these events led in March 1905 to the [[Theriso]] Revolution, whose leader he was.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Revolution of Theriso===\n{{details|Theriso revolt}}\n[[File:Eleftherios Venizelos.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Venizelos at the beginning of the 20th century.]]\n\nOn 10 March 1905, the rebels gathered in Theriso and declared \"the political union of Crete with Greece as a single free constitutional state\";<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 95</ref> the resolution was given to the Great Powers, where it was argued that the illegitimate provisional arrangement was preventing the island's economic growth and that the only logical solution to the \"Cretan Question\" was the unification with Greece. The High Commissioner, with the approval of the Great Powers, replied to the rebels that military force would be used against them.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> However, more deputies joined with Venizelos in Theriso.

On 18 July, the Great Powers declared martial law, but that did not discourage the rebels. On 15 August, the regular assembly in Chania voted in favor of most of the reforms that Venizelos proposed. The Great Powers' consuls met Venizelos again and accepted the reforms he had proposed. This led to the end of the Theriso revolt and to the resignation of Prince George as the High Commissioner.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Great Powers assigned the authority for selecting the island's new High Commissioner to King George I of Greece, thereby ''de facto'' nullifying the Ottoman suzerainty. An ex-Prime Minister of Greece, [[Alexandros Zaimis]], was chosen for the place of High Commissioner, and Greek officers and non-commissioned officers were allowed to undertake the organization of the [[Cretan Gendarmerie]]. As soon as the Gendarmerie was organized, the foreign troops began to withdraw from the island. This was also a personal victory for Venizelos, who as a result achieved fame not only in Greece but also in Europe.<ref name=\"SU2\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Young Turk Revolution]], which Venizelos welcomed, Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire on 5 October 1908, and one day later [[Franz Joseph]], [[Emperor of Austria]] announced the [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Encouraged by these events, on the same day, the Cretans in turn rose up. Thousands of citizens in Chania and the surrounding regions on that day formed a rally, in which Venizelos declared the union of Crete with Greece. Having communicated with the government of [[Athens]], Zaimis left for Athens before the rally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAn assembly was convened and declared the independence of Crete. The civil servants were sworn in the name of King George I of Greece, while a five-member Executive Committee was established, with the authority to control the island on behalf of the King and according to the laws of the Greek state. Chairman of the committee was Antonios Michelidakis and Venizelos became Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs. In April 1910 a new assembly was convened and Venizelos was elected chairman and then Prime Minister.

His proposals were considered by the King and the Greek politicians dangerous for the political establishment. However, King George I, fearing an escalation of the crisis, convened a council with political leaders, and recommended them to accept Venizelos' proposals. After many postponements the King agreed to assign [[Stephanos Dragoumis]] (Venizelos' indication) to form a new government that would lead the country to elections once the League was disbanded.<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 129\u2013133</ref> In the elections of 8 August 1910, almost half the seats in the parliament were won by Independents, who were newcomers to the Greek political scene. Venizelos, despite doubts as to the validity of his Greek citizenship and without having campaigned in person, finished at the top at the electoral list in [[Attica]]. He was immediately recognized as the leader of the independents and thus he founded the political party, ''[[Komma Fileleftheron]]'' (Liberal Party). Soon after his election he decided to call for new elections in hope of winning an [[absolute majority]]. The old parties boycotted the new election in protest<ref name=\"Mazo886\">Mazower, 1992, p. 886</ref> and on 11 December 1910, Venizelos' party [[November 1910 Greek legislative election|won 307 seats out of 362]], with most of the elected citizens being new in the political scene.  Venizelos formed a government and started to reorganize the economic, political, and national affairs of the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Reforms in 1910\u20131914===\nVenizelos tried to advance his reform program in the realms of political and social ideologies, of education, and literature, by adopting practically viable compromises between often conflicting tendencies. In education, for example, the dynamic current in favor of the use of the popular spoken language, [[dimotiki]], provoked conservative reactions, which led to the constitutionally embedded decision (Article 107) in favor of a formal \"purified\" language, [[katharevousa]], which looked back to classical precedents.<ref name=\"NF1910\">{{cite web |last=Gardika-Katsiadaki |first=Eleni |title=Period 1910 \u2013 1914 |publisher=National Foundation Research |year=2008 |url=http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio10-14.jsp |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233429/http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio10-14.jsp |archivedate = 18 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 May 1911, a revision of the Constitution was completed, which focused on strengthening individual freedoms, introducing measures to facilitate the legislative work of the Parliament, establishing of obligatory [[elementary education]], the legal right for compulsory [[Nationalization|expropriation]], ensuring permanent appointment for civil servants, the right to invite foreign personnel to undertake the reorganization of the administration  and the armed forces, the re-establishment of the State Council and the simplification of the procedures for the reform of the Constitution. The aim of the reform program was to consolidate public security and rule of law as well as to develop and increase the wealth-producing potential of the country. In this context, the long planned \"eighth\" Ministry, the [[Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Greece)|Ministry of National Economy]], assumed a leading role. This Ministry, from the time of its creation at the beginning of 1911, was headed by [[Emmanuel Benakis]], a wealthy Greek merchant from [[Egypt]] and friend of Venizelos.<ref name=\"NF1910\"/> Between 1911 and 1912 a number of laws aiming to initiate [[labor legislation]] in Greece were promulgated. Specific measures were enacted that prohibited child labor and night-shift work for women, that regulated the hours of the working week and the Sunday holiday, and allowed for labor organizations.<ref>Kyriakou, 2002, pp. 491\u2013492</ref> Venizelos also took measures for the improvement of management, justice and security and for the settlement of the landless peasants of Thessaly.<ref name=\"NF1910\"/>\n\n===Balkan Wars===\n{{details|Balkan Wars}}\n\n====Background====\n[[Image:Balkans at 1905.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The boundaries of the Balkan states before the [[Balkan Wars]].]]\n\nAt the time there were diplomatic contacts with the [[Ottoman Empire]] to initiate reforms in Macedonia and in [[Thrace]], which at the time were under the control of the Ottoman Empire, for improving the living conditions of the Christian populations. Failure of such reforms would leave as a single option to remove Ottoman Empire from the [[Balkans]], an idea that most Balkan countries shared. This scenario appeared realistic to Venizelos, because Ottoman Empire was under a [[Young Turks|constitutional transition]] and its administrative mechanism was disorganized and weakened.<ref>Hall, 2000, pp. 1\u20139</ref> There was also no fleet capable of transporting forces from [[Asia Minor]] to Europe, while in contrast the Greek fleet was dominating the [[Aegean Sea]]. Venizelos did not want to initiate any immediate major movements in the Balkans, until the Greek army and navy were reorganized (an effort that had begun from the last government of [[Georgios Theotokis]]) and the Greek economy was revitalized.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 141</ref> In light of this, Venizelos proposed to Ottoman Empire to recognize the Cretans the right to send deputies to the Greek Parliament, as a solution for closing the ''Cretan Question''. However, the [[Young Turks]] (feeling confident after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war in 1897]]) threatened that they would make a military walk to Athens, if the Greeks insisted on such claims.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Balkan League====\n{{details|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and Eleftherios Venizelos-cropped.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|With the Serbian Prime Minister [[Nikola Pasic]] in 1913]]\nVenizelos, seeing no improvements after his approach with the Turks on the ''Cretan Question'' and at the same time not wanting to see Greece remain inactive as in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War in 1877]] (where Greece's neutrality left the country out of the peace talks), he decided that the only way to settle the disputes with Ottoman Empire, was to join the other Balkan countries, [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Montenegro]], in an alliance known as the [[Balkan League]]. [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]] was sent to represent Greece to a royal feast in [[Sofia]], and in 1911 Bulgarian students were invited to Athens.<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 150</ref> These events had a positive impact and on 30 May 1912 Greece and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty that ensured mutual support in case of a Turkish attack on either country. Negotiations with Serbia, which Venizelos had initiated to achieve a similar agreement, were concluded in early 1913,<ref name=\"Kitromilidesp145\">Kitromilides, 2006, p. 145</ref> before that there were only oral agreements.<ref>Hall, 2000, p. 13</ref>\n\nMontenegro opened hostilities by declaring war on Turkey on 8 October 1912.

The Greek population received these developments very enthusiastically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====First Balkan War \u2013 The first conflict with Prince Constantine====\n{{details|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:158 14 Constantin Venizelos.jpg|thumb|Venizelos with Constantine]]\n\nThe outbreak of the First Balkan war caused Venizelos a great deal of trouble in his relations with Crown Prince Constantine. Part of the problems can be attributed to the complexity of the official relations between the two men. Although Constantine was a Prince and the future King, he also held the title of army commander, thus remaining under the direct order of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and subsequently under Venizelos. But his father, King George, in accordance to the constitutional conditions of the time had been the undisputed leader of the country. Thus in practical terms Venizelos' authority over his commander of the army was diminished due to the obvious relation between the Crown Prince and the King.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn these conditions the army started a victorious march to Macedonia under the command of Constantine. Soon the first disagreement between Venizelos and Constantine emerged, and it concerned the aims of the army's operations. The Crown Prince insisted on the clear military aims of the war: to defeat the opposed Ottoman army as a necessary condition for any occupation, wherever the opponent army was or was going; and the main part of the Ottoman army soon started retreating to the north towards [[Bitola|Monastir]]. Venizelos was more realistic and insisted on the political aims of the war: to liberate as many geographical areas and cities as fast as possible, particularly Macedonia and Thessaloniki; thus heading east. The debate became evident after the victory of the Greek army at [[Battle of Sarantaporo|Sarantaporo]], when the future direction of the armys' march was to be decided. Venizelos intervened and insisted that [[Thessaloniki]], as a major city and [[Port of Thessaloniki|strategic port]] in the surrounding area, should be taken at all costs and thus a turn to the east was necessary.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In accordance to his views, Venizelos sent the following telegraph to the General Staff:\n\n{{cquote|Salonique \u00e0 tout prix!<ref name=\"Chesterp159-160\">Chester, 1921, pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n\n[[Image:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913.]]\n\nand tried to keep frequent communication with the key figure, the King, in order to prevent the Prince from marching north.<ref name=\"Chesterp159-160\"/> Subsequently, although the Greek army won the [[Battle of Giannitsa|Giannitsa battle]] situated 40&nbsp;km west of Salonika, Constantine's hesitation in capturing the city after a week had passed, led into an open confrontation with Venizelos. Venizelos, having accurate information from the Greek embassy in Sofia about the movement of the Bulgarian army towards the city, sent a telegram to Constantine in a strict tone, holding him responsible for the possible loss of Thessaloniki. The tone in Venizelos' telegram and that in the answer from Constantine that followed to announce the final agreement with the Turks, is widely considered as the start of the conflict between the two men that would lead Greece into the National Schism during World War I. Finally on 26 October 1912, the Greek army entered [[Thessaloniki]], shortly ahead of the [[Bulgarians]].<ref>Hall, 2000, pp. 61\u201362</ref> But soon a new reason of friction emerged due to Venizelos' concern about Constantine's acceptance of the Bulgarian request to enter the city. A small Bulgarian unit, which soon became a full division moved into the city and immediately started an attempt to establish a condominium in spite of initial assurances to the contrary, showing no intentions to leave. After Venizelos' protest Constantine asked him to take the responsibility (as a prime minister) by ordering him to force them out, but that was hardly an option since that would certainly lead to confrontation with the Bulgarians. To Venizelos' view, since Constantine allowed the Bulgarians to enter the city, he now passed the responsibility of a possible conflict with them to him, in an attempt to deny his initial fault. To Constantine, it was an attempt by Venizelos to get involved in clearly military issues. Most historians agree that Constantine failed to see the political dimensions of his decisions. As a consequence both incidents increased mutual misunderstanding, shortly before Constantine's accession to the throne.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nOnce the campaign in Macedonia was completed, a large part of the Greek army under the Crown Prince was redeployed to [[Epirus]], and in the [[Battle of Bizani]] the Ottoman positions were overcome and [[Ioannina]] taken on 22 February 1913. Meanwhile, the Greek navy rapidly occupied the Aegean islands still under Ottoman rule. After two victories, the Greek fleet established naval supremacy over the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements to the Balkans.<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 161\u2013164</ref><ref>Hall, 2000, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 20 November, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria signed a truce treaty with Turkey. It followed a conference in London, in which Greece took part, although the Greek army still continued its operations in the Epirus front. The conference led to the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] between the Balkan countries and Turkey. These two conferences gave the first indications of Venizelos' diplomatic efficiency and realism. During the negotiations and facing the dangers of Bulgarian maximalism, Venizelos succeeded in establishing close relations with the Serbs. A Serbian-Greek military protocol was signed on 1 June 1913 ensuring mutual protection in case of a Bulgarian attack.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Second Balkan War====\n{{details|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:Demonstration in Greece during Balkan Wars.jpg|thumb|220px|Demonstration in Greece during the Balkan Wars with the words \"Long Live Venizelos\".]]\n[[File:Participants in the Bucharest Peace Treaty negotiations, 1913.jpg|thumb|Venizelos with other participants in Bucharest peace treaty negotiations]]\nDespite all this, the Bulgarians still wanted to become a hegemonic power in the Balkans and made excessive claims to this end, while Serbia asked for more territory than what was initially agreed with the Bulgarians. Serbia was asking for a revision of the original treaty, since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers' decision to establish the state of Albania, in an area that had been recognized as a Serbian territory of expansion under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Bulgarians also laid claims on Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia. In the conference of London, Venizelos rebuffed these claims, citing the fact that it had been occupied by the Greek army,<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 169</ref> and that Bulgaria had denied any definite settlement of territorial claims during the pre-war discussions, as it had done with Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe rupture between the allies, due to the Bulgarian claims, was inevitable, and Bulgaria found herself standing against Greece and Serbia. On 19 May 1913, [[Greek-Serbian Alliance of 1913|a pact of alliance]] was signed in Thessaloniki between Greece and Serbia. On 19 June, the Second Balkan War began with a surprise Bulgarian assault against Serbian and Greek positions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bulgaria, The Balkan Wars | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008  |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-42742 }}</ref> Constantine, now King after [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|his father's assassination in March]], neutralized the Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki and pushed the Bulgarian army further back with a series of hard-fought victories. Bulgaria was overwhelmed by the Greek and Serbian armies,{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} while in the north [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] interfered against Bulgaria and the [[Romanian army]] was marching towards Sofia; Ottomans also took advantage of the situation and retook most of the territory taken by Bulgaria. The Bulgarians asked for truce. Venizelos went to [[Vyroneia|Hadji-Beylik]], where the Greek headquarters were, to confer with Constantine on the Greek territorial claims in the peace conference. Then he went to [[Bucharest]], where a peace conference was assembled. On 28 June 1913 a [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|peace treaty]] was signed with Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Romania on one side and Bulgaria on the other. Thus, after two successful wars, Greece had doubled its territory by gaining most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], Crete and the rest of the [[Aegean Islands]],<ref>Tucker, 1999, p. 107</ref> although the status of the latter remained as yet undetermined and a cause of tension with the Ottomans.<!-- More should be added in a new section on the 1914 naval crisis with Turkey, which also initiated the idea of a \"population exchange\" -->{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===World War I and Greece===\n{{See also|World War I||Balkans Campaign (World War I)| Gallipoli Campaign|Macedonian front (World War I)}}\n\n====Dispute over Greece's role in World War I====\n[[Image:Eleftherios Venizelos, Belgrade bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Eleftherios Venizelos in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].]]\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I and the Austro-Hungarian invasion in Serbia, a major issue started regarding the participation or not of Greece and Bulgaria in the war. Greece had an active treaty with Serbia which was the treaty activated in the 1913 Bulgarian attack that caused the Second Balkan War. That treaty was envisaged in a purely Balkan context, and was thus invalid against [[Austria-Hungary]], as was supported by Constantine and his advisors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe situation changed when the Allies, in an attempt to help Serbia, offered Bulgaria the [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]]\u2013[[Ochrid]] area of Serbia and the Greek Eastern Macedonia (the [[Kavala]] and [[Drama, Greece|Drama]] areas) if she joined the Entente. Venizelos, having received assurances over Asia Minor if the Greeks participated in the alliance, agreed to cede the area to Bulgaria.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 154</ref>\n\nBut Constantine's anti-Bulgarism made such a transaction impossible. Constantine refused to go to war under such conditions and the men parted. As a consequence Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] and invaded Serbia, an event leading to Serbia's final collapse. Greece remained neutral. Venizelos supported an alliance with the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], not only believing that Britain and France would win, but also that it was the only choice for Greece, because the combination of the strong Anglo-French naval control over the Mediterranean and the geographical distribution of the Greek population, could have ill effects in the case of a naval blockade, as he characteristically remarked:\n\n{{cquote| One cannot kick against geography!<ref>Seligman, 1920, p. 31</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Constantine favored the [[Central Powers]] and wanted Greece to remain neutral.<ref name=\"BA3\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=World War I \u2013 Greek Affairs | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53151}}</ref> He was influenced both by his belief in the military superiority of [[German Empire|Germany]] and also by his German wife, [[Sophia of Prussia|Queen Sophia]], and his pro-German court.

A small scale mobilisation of the Greek army took place.\n\nThe dispute between Venizelos and the King reached its height shortly after that and the King invoked a [[Greek Constitution of 1911|Greek constitutional provision]] that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government unilaterally. Meanwhile, using the excuse of saving Serbia, in October 1915, the Entente disembarked an army in Thessaloniki,<ref name=\"BA5\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Constantine I | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9025982}}</ref> after invitation by Venizelos. This action of Prime Minister Venizelos enraged Constantine.\n\nThe dispute continued between the two men, and in December 1915 Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling for [[December 1915 Greek legislative election|new elections]]. Venizelos left Athens and moved back to Crete. Venizelos did not take part in the elections, as he considered the dissolution of Parliament unconstitutional.<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 271</ref><ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 122</ref>\n\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|left|The 1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches before the White Tower on its way to the front.]]\n\nOn 26 May 1916 the [[Fort Roupel|Fort Rupel]] (a significant military fort in Macedonia) was unconditionally surrendered by the royalist government to Germano-Bulgarian forces.<ref>Leon, 1974, pp. 356\u20137</ref> This produced a deplorable impression. The Allies feared a possible secret alliance between the royalist government and Central Powers placing in grave danger of their armies in Macedonia. On the other hand, the surrender of Fort Rupel for Venizelos and his supporters meant the beginning of the destruction of Greek Macedonia. Despite German assurances that the integrity of the Kingdom of Greece would be respected they were unable to restrain the Bulgarian forces, which had started dislocating the Greek population, and by 4 September [[Kavala]] was occupied.<ref>Leon, 1974, p. 381</ref>\n\nOn 16 August 1916, during a rally in Athens, and with the support of the allied army that had landed in Thessaloniki under the command of General [[Maurice Sarrail]], Venizelos announced publicly his total disagreement with the Crown's policies. The effect of this was to further polarize the population between the [[Monarchism|royalists]] (also known as ''anti-Venezelists''), who supported the crown, and [[Venizelist]]s, who supported Venizelos. On 30 August 1916, Venizelist army officers organized a military coup in Thessaloniki, and proclaimed the \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\". Venizelos along with Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] and General [[Panagiotis Danglis]] agreed to form a provisional government and on 9 October they moved to Thessaloniki and assumed command of the National Defence to oversee the Greek participation in the allied war effort. The triumvirate, as the three men became known, had formed this government in direct conflict with the Athens political establishment.<ref name=\"Kitromilides2008p124\">Kitromilides, 2008, p. 124</ref> There they founded a separate \"provisional state\" including Northern Greece, Crete and the Aegean Islands, with the support of the Entente.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 87</ref> Primarily, these areas comprised the \"New Lands\" won during the Balkan Wars, in which Venizelos enjoyed a broad support, while \"Old Greece\" was mostly pro-royalist. However, Venizelos declared \"we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians\". He didn't want to abolish the monarchy and continued his efforts to persuade the King to join the Allies, blaming his \"bad advisors\" for his stance.\n\nThe National Defence government started assembling an army for the Macedonian front and soon participated in operations against the [[Central Powers]] forces.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====\"Noemvriana\" \u2013 Greece enters World War I====\n{{details|Noemvriana}}\n[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|French troops in Athens, with the Acropolis in the background, after the ''Noemvriana''.]]\n\nIn the following months after the creation of provisional government in Thessaloniki in late August, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilisation of the Greek army as a counterbalance of the unconditional surrender of Fort Rupel by the royalist government and military evacuation of Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. On the other hand, the king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognise Venizelos' provisional government or further support it, guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected, and a promise that any war material surrendered to the Allies would be returned after the war.<ref name=\"Leon1974p422\">Leon, 1974, p. 422</ref>\n\nThe Franco-British use of Greece's territory in co-operation with the Venizelos government {{cref|i}} throughout 1916 was opposed in royalist circles and therefore increased Constantine's popularity, and caused much excitement and several anti-Allied demonstrations took place in Athens.<ref name=\"Kitromilides2008p124\"/>  Moreover, a growing movement had been developed in the army among lower officers, led by military officers [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and [[Sofoklis Dousmanis]], determined to oppose disarmament and the surrender of any war materials to the Allies.<ref>Leon, 1974, p. 428</ref>\n\n[[Image:Venizelos WWI 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Venizelos reviews a section of the Greek army on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] during the First World War, 1918.

On the next day, 24 November, du Fournet presented a new ultimatum ending on 1 December to the government of Athens demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten mountain batteries.<ref name=Leon1974p434>Leon, 1974, p. 434</ref> The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands.

However, he promised that the Greek forces would receive orders not to fire against the Allied contingent.<ref name=Leon1974p435>Leon, 1974, p. 435</ref>  Despite the gravity of the situation both the royalist government and the Allies let the events take their own course. The royalist government decided to reject the admiral's demands on 29 November and armed resistance was organised. By 30 November military units and royalist militia (the ''epistratoi'', \"reservists\") from surrounding areas have been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 men<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 293</ref><ref>Seligman, 1920, p. 139</ref><ref>Ion, 1918, pp. 796\u2013812</ref>) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon.<ref name=Leon1974p435 /> On the other hand, the Allied authorities failed in their assessment of the prevailing temper. A diplomat characteristically insisted that the Greeks were bluffing, and in the face of force they would ''\"bring the cannons on a plater\"''; a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared.<ref name=Leon1974p435 />\n\n[[File:Leaders of Allied Powers in World War I.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph depicting Venizelos along with the principal Allied leaders of World War I, David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, Ferdinand Foch and Woodrow Wilson.]]\nThe Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on {{OldStyleDate|1 December|1916|18 November}}. However, it met organized resistance and an armed confrontation took place for a day till a compromise was reached. After the evacuation of the Allied contingent from Athens the following day, a royalist mob raged though the city for three days targeting supporters of Venizelos. The incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece, which was using the Old Style calendar at the time, and drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and their political opponents, deepening what would become known as the [[National Schism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAfter the armed confrontation in Athens, on {{OldStyleDate|2 December|1916|19 November}}, Britain and France officially recognised the government under Venizelos as the lawful government, effectively splitting Greece into two separate entities.<ref>Burg, 1998, pp. 145\u20136</ref> On {{OldStyleDate|7 December|1916|24 November}}, Venizelos' provisional government officially declared war on the Central Powers.<ref>Vatikotes, 1998 p. 98</ref><ref>Burg, 1998, p.145</ref> In reply, a royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was issued and the [[Archbishop of Athens]], under pressure by the royal house,<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 367</ref> [[anathema]]tised him.<ref>Hickey, 2004, p. 87</ref> The Allies unwilling to risk a new fiasco, but determined to solve the problem, established a naval blockade around southern Greece, which was still loyal to the king, and that caused extreme hardship to people in those areas.<ref name=\"Clogg2002p89\">Clogg, 2002, p. 89</ref> In June France and Great Britain decided to invoke their obligation as ''\"protecting powers\"'', who had promised to guarantee a constitutional form for Greece at the time the Kingdom was created, to demand the king's resignation.<ref>Gibbons, 1920, p. 299</ref> Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went to exile, leaving his son Alexander on the throne as demanded (whom the Allies considered as pro-Entente), instead of his elder son and crown prince, [[George II of Greece|George]].<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 295\u2013304</ref><ref name=\"TA1\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764941-2,00.html Land of Invasion], [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], 4 November 1940</ref> His departure was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalists, especially army officers such as [[Ioannis Metaxas]], to exile in France and Italy.\n\nThe course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return in Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially entered the war on the side of the Allies. Subsequently, the entire Greek army was mobilized (though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|monarchy]] and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the [[Central Powers]] army on the Macedonian front.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Conclusion of World War I====\n{{See also|Battle of Skra-di-Legen|Armistice of Thessalonica|Armistice of Mudros|Occupation of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Greek Parade Paris 1919.jpg|thumb|left|Painting depicting Greek military units in the World War I Victory Parade in [[Arc de Triomphe]], Paris.

Under the command of French General [[Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]], a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], starting on 14 September 1918. After the first heavy fighting (see [[Battle of Skra-di-Legen|Battle of Skra]]) the Bulgarians gave up their defensive positions and began retreating back towards their country. On 24 September the Bulgarian government asked for an [[Armistice with Bulgaria (World War I)|armistice]], which was signed five days later.<ref>The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1922, p. 308</ref>  The Allied army then pushed north and defeated the remaining German and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian forces]] that tried to halt the Allied offensive. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918 marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The breaking of the Macedonian front was one of the important breakthroughs of the military stalemate and helped to bring an end to the War.

His death revived the constitutional question of whether Greece should be a [[monarchy]] or a [[republic]] and transformed the November elections into a contest between Venizelos and the return of the exiled king Constantine, Alexander's father.

This catastrophe marked the end of the [[Megali Idea]].

Venizelos had expressed his will to improve the bilateral Greek\u2013Turkish relations even before his electoral victory, in a speech in Thessaloniki (23 July 1928). Eleven days after the formation of his government, he sent letters to both the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs of Turkey ([[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] and [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc]] respectively), declaring that Greece had no territorial aspirations to the detriment of their country. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's response was positive and Italy was eager to help the two countries reach an agreement. Negotiations however stalled because of the complicated issue of the properties of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|exchanged populations]]. Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on 30 April 1930; on 25 October, Venizelos visited Turkey and signed a treaty of friendship. Venizelos even forwarded Atat\u00fcrk's name for the 1934 [[Nobel Peace Prize]],<ref name=nobel>Nobel Foundation. ''The Nomination Database for the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Prize in Peace]], 1901\u20131955''.[http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=show&showid=2046 nobelprize.org]</ref> highlighting the mutual respect between the two leaders.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 107</ref> The German [[Chancellor]] [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] described the Greek-Turkish rapprochement as the ''\"greatest achievement seen in Europe since the end of the Great War\"''. Nevertheless, Venizelos' initiative was criticized domestically not only by the opposition but also by members of his own party that represented the Greek refugees from Turkey. Venizelos was accused of making too many concessions on the issues of naval armaments and of the properties of the Greeks who were expelled from Turkey according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, pp. 95\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the Venizelos government, in an effort to avoid reactions from the lower-classes whose conditions had worsened due to wave of immigration, introduced the so-called [[Idionymon]] (#4229), a law that restricted civil liberties and initiated the repression against [[Trade union|unionism]], left-wing supporters and [[communism|communists]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nHis domestic position was weakened, however, by the effects of the [[Great Depression]] in the early 1930s;<ref>Black, 1948, p. 94</ref> and in the [[1932 Greek legislative election|elections of 1932]] he was defeated by the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] under [[Panagis Tsaldaris]]. The political climate became more tense and in 1933 Venizelos was the target of a second assassination attempt.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 103</ref> The pro-royalist tendencies of the new government led to two Venizelist coup attempts by General [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]: one in 1933 and the other in 1935. The failure of the [[Greek coup attempt of 1935|latter]] proved decisive for the future of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]]. After the coup's failure Venizelos left Greece once more, while in Greece trials and executions of prominent Venizelists were carried out and he himself was sentenced to death ''in absentia''. The severely weakened Republic was abolished in another coup in October 1935 by General [[Georgios Kondylis]] and George II returned to the throne following a rigged [[1935 Greek plebiscite|referendum]] in November.<ref>Black, 1948, pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Death==\nVenizelos left for Paris and on 12 March 1936 wrote his last letter to Alexandros Zannas. He suffered a stroke on the morning of the 13th and died five days later in his flat at 22 rue Beaujon.<ref>Manolikakis, 1985, pp. 18\u201322; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Veniselos, ''A l'ombre de Veniselos'' (Paris, 1955)</ref> The absolution was performed on 21 March at [[St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Paris|St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Church]]; his body was deposed in the crypt before its transportation on the 23rd at the beginning of the afternoon to the [[Gare de Lyon]]. His body was then taken by the [[destroyer]] [[Greek destroyer Kountouriotis (D 99)|''Pavlos Kountouriotis'']] to Chania, avoiding Athens in order not to cause unrest. A great ceremony with wide public attendance accompanied his burial at Akrotiri, Crete.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:EleftheriosVenizelosGraveCloseup.jpg|thumb|Venizelos' gravestone in Akrotiri, near [[Chania]], [[Crete]].]]\n[[File:Venizelos Theriso2.JPG|thumb|A statue in [[Theriso]], Crete.]]\nOne of the main contributions of Venizelos to Greek political life was the creation, in 1910, of the Liberal Party, which contrasted with the Greek parties of that period. Until the early twentieth century, the Greek parties were inspired by the protecting powers ([[French Party (Greece)|French]] or [[English Party (Greece)|English Party]] for example) or clustered around a political personality, such as [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]. The Liberal Party was based around the ideas of Venizelos (and the military coup of Goudi), but it survived its creator. In addition, the birth of a leading party would coincide with the birth of an opposing party. The opposing party was reflected around the personality of the king, but that survived the various abolitions of the monarchy.<ref>Koliopoulos, 2002, p. 53-54</ref> [[Venizelism]], from its inception, is essentially a liberal Republican movement, which opposes anti-venizelist monarchist and conservative ideologies. These two competed for power throughout the inter-war period.<ref>Legg, p. 188-189</ref>\n\nIts main ideas, adapted from its creator, were: opposition to the monarchy; the defence of the Megali Idea; formation of alliances with western democratic countries, in particular the United Kingdom and France against Germany during the First and Second World Wars, and later with the United States against the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]]; and finally a protectionist economic policy.<ref>Contogeorgis, 1996, p. 379-404</ref>\n\n[[Themistoklis Sofoulis]] was, from the 1920s, the successor of Venizelos as leader of the Liberal Party, which survived policy failures, exile and ultimately death of the historical founder. In 1950, the son of Venizelos, Sophoklis Venizelos, succeeded as head of the Liberal Party at a time when an agreement was formed with the populists (name of the royalist party) against the communists during the civil war. The [[Center Union]] (Enosis Kendrou), founded in 1961 by [[George Papandreou (senior)|Georgios Papandreou]], became the ideological descendant of the Liberal Party. The Center Union eventually fade in the late 1970s and was replaced by a party further to the left, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] of [[Andreas Papandreou]].<ref>Koliopoulos, 2002, p. 104</ref>\n\n==Personal life and family==\nIn December 1891 Venizelos married Maria Katelouzou, daughter of Eleftherios Katelouzos. The newlyweds lived in the upper floor of the Chalepa house, while Venizelos' mother and his brother and sisters lived on the ground floor. There, they enjoyed the happy moments of their marriage and also had the birth of their two children, {{Interlanguage link multi|Kyriakos Venizelos{{!}}Kyriakos|el|3=\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03b6\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} in 1892 and [[Sofoklis Venizelos|Sofoklis]] in 1894. Their married life was short and marked by misfortune. Maria died of post-puerperal fever in November 1894 after the birth of their second child. Her death deeply affected Venizelos and as sign of mourning he grew his characteristic beard and mustache, which he retained for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"SI1\"/>\n\nAfter his defeat in the November elections of 1920 he left for [[Nice]] and Paris in self-imposed exile. In September 1921, twenty-seven years after the death of his first wife Maria, he married [[Helena Schilizzi]] (sometimes referred to as Elena Skylitsi or Stephanovich) in London. Advised by police to be wary of assassination attempts, they held the religious ceremony in private at [[Witanhurst]], the mansion of family friend and socialite, [[Arthur Henry Crosfield|Lady Domini Crosfield]]. The Crosfields were well connected and Venizelos met [[Arthur Balfour]], [[David Lloyd George]] and the arms dealer [[Basil Zaharoff]] in subsequent visits to the house.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe married couple settled down in Paris in a flat at 22 rue Beaujon.{{Clarify|date=December 2015 |reason=Unlikely or at least imprecise, as he was Prime Minister & President of Parliament in 1924}} He lived there until 1927 when he returned to Chania.<ref name=\"SI1\"/>\n\n=== Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree ===\n{{Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greece|Biography}}\n* [[History of Modern Greece]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Venizelos shop Chania.JPG|Venizelos father's shop in [[Chania]].\nFile:Eleftherios Venizelos, portrait 1935.jpg|Venizelos in 1935\nFile:Photo 2 Immeuble 22 rue Beaujon, Paris.jpg|Building 22 rue Beaujon in Paris where Venizelos died.\nFile:Venizelosthes.jpg|A statue in [[Thessaloniki]] (sculpt.

He is noted for his contribution in the expansion of Greece and promotion of liberal-democratic policies.<ref name=\"BK1\">Kitromilides, 2006, p. 178</ref><ref name=\"TA0\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,717746-1,00.html 'Liberty Still Rules'], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], 18 February 1924</ref><ref name=\"BA0\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Veniz\u00e9los, Eleuth\u00e9rios | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075030}}</ref> As leader of the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]], he was elected eight times as [[Prime Minister of Greece]], serving from 1910 to 1920 and from 1928 to 1933. Venizelos had such profound influence on the internal and external affairs of Greece that he is credited with being \"the maker of modern Greece\",<ref>Duffield J. W., The New York Times, 30 October 1921, Sunday [https://www.nytimes.com/1921/10/30/archives/venizelos-maker-of-modern-greece.html link]</ref> and is still widely known as the \"[[Ethnarch]]\".\n\nHis first entry into the international scene was with his significant role in the autonomy of the [[Cretan State]] and later in the union of [[Crete]] with Greece. Soon, he was invited to Greece to resolve the political deadlock and became the country's Prime Minister. Not only did he initiate constitutional and economic reforms that set the basis for the modernization of Greek society, but also reorganized both army and navy in preparation of future conflicts. Before the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, Venizelos' catalytic role helped gain Greece entrance to the [[Balkan League]], an alliance of the Balkan states against the Ottoman Empire. Through his diplomatic acumen, Greece doubled its area and population with the liberation of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and most of the [[Aegean islands]].\n\nIn World War I (1914\u20131918), he brought Greece on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], further expanding the Greek borders. However, his pro-Allied foreign policy brought him into direct conflict with [[Constantine I of Greece]], causing the [[National Schism]]. The Schism polarized the population between the [[Monarchism|royalists]] and [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] and the struggle for power between the two groups affected the political and social life of Greece for decades.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1612186 |title=Intrigue in Greece. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=4 July 1916 |accessdate=29 November 2012 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  Following the Allied victory, Venizelos secured new territorial gains, especially in [[Anatolia]], coming close to realizing the ''[[Megali Idea]]''. Despite his achievements, he was defeated in the 1920 General Election, which contributed to the eventual Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]]. Venizelos, in self-imposed exile, represented Greece in the negotiations that led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], and the agreement of a mutual exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey.\n\nIn his subsequent periods in office, Venizelos succeeded in restoring normal relations with Greece's neighbors and expanded his constitutional and economical reforms. In 1935 he resurfaced from retirement to support a military coup. Its failure severely weakened the [[Second Hellenic Republic]].\n\n==Origins and early years==\n\n===Ancestors===\n[[File:Venizelos House Mournies.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The house of Venizelos in Mournies.]]\n\nIn the 18th century, the ancestors of Venizelos, named Cravvatas, lived in [[Mystras]], in southern [[Peloponnese]]. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] raids in the peninsula in 1770, a member of the Cravvatas family, Venizelos Cravvatas, the youngest of several brothers, managed to escape to [[Crete]] where he established himself. His sons discarded their patronymic and called themselves Venizelos. The family was of [[Laconia|Laconic]], [[Mani Peninsula|Maniot]], and [[Cretan]] origin.<ref name=\"Chester4\">Chester, 1921, p. 4</ref>\n\n===Family and education===\n{{see also|#Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree{{!}}\u00a7 Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree}}\n[[File:Kyriakos Venizelos.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait of Kyriakos Venizelos, father of Eleftherios.]]\n\nEleftherios was born in [[Mournies]], near [[Chania]] (formerly known as Canea) in then-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Crete]] to {{Interlanguage link multi|Kyriakos Venizelos|la|3=Cyriacus Benizelus}}, a Cretan merchant and revolutionary, and [[Styliani Ploumidaki]].<ref name=\"SI1\">{{cite web |last=Mitsotaki |first=Zoi |title=Venizelos the Cretan.

In 1881 he enrolled at the [[University of Athens]] Law School and got his degree in Law with excellent grades. He returned to Crete in 1886 and worked as a lawyer in Chania. Throughout his life he maintained a passion for reading and was constantly improving his skills in English, Italian, German, and French.<ref name=\"Chester4\"/>\n\n===Entry into politics===\nThe situation in Crete during Venizelos' early years was fluid. The [[Ottoman empire]] was undermining the reforms, which were made under international pressure, while the Cretans desired to see the Sultan, [[Abdul Hamid II]], abandon \"the ungrateful infidels\".<ref name=\"Ion277\">Ion, 1910, p. 277</ref> Under these unstable conditions Venizelos entered into politics in the elections of 2 April 1889 as a member of the island's liberal party.<ref name=\"SI1\"/> As a deputy he was distinguished for his eloquence and his radical opinions.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 45, 47</ref>\n\n==Political career in Crete==\n{{See also|History of Crete}}\n\n===Cretan uprising===\n\n====Background====\nThe numerous revolutions in Crete, during and after the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821, 1833, 1841, 1858, 1866, 1878, 1889, 1895, 1897)<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 16</ref> were the result of the Cretans' desire for Enosis \u2014 Union with Greece.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 65</ref> In the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan revolution of 1866]], the two sides, under the pressure of the [[Great Powers]], came to an agreement, which was finalized in the [[Pact of Halepa|Pact of Chalepa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Later the Pact was included in the provisions of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which was supplementing previous concessions granted to the Cretans \u2014 e.g. the Organic Law Constitution (1868) designed by [[William James Stillman]]. In summary the Pact was granting a large degree of self-government to Greeks in Crete as a means of limiting their desire to rise up against their [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman overlords]].<ref name=\"BR1\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pact of Halepa | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008  |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9038873 }}</ref> However the [[Cretan Turks|Muslims of Crete]], who identified with Ottoman Empire, were not satisfied with these reforms, as in their view the  administration of the island was delivered to the hands of the Christian Greek population. In practice, the Ottoman Empire failed to enforce the provisions of the Pact, thus fueling the existing tensions between the two communities; instead, the Ottoman authorities attempted to maintain order by the dispatching of substantial military reinforcements during 1880\u20131896. Throughout that period, the ''Cretan Question'' was a major issue of friction in the relations of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|independent Greece]] with the Ottoman Empire.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn January 1897 violence and disorder were escalating on the island, thus polarizing the population.

A Greek force of about 2,000 men had landed at [[Kolymbari]] on 3 February 1897,<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 62</ref> and its commanding officer, Colonel [[Timoleon Vassos]] declared that he was taking over the island \"in the name of the [[George I of Greece|King of the Hellenes]]\" and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece.<ref>Kerofilias, 1915, p. 14</ref> This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers decided to blockade Crete with their fleets and land their troops, thus stopping the Greek army from approaching Chania.<ref name=\"Dunningp367\">Dunning, Jun. 1987, p. 367</ref>\n\n====Events at Akrotiri====\n[[File:Venizelos at Akrotiri.jpg|thumb|220px|Venizelos at Akrotiri, 1897.]]\n\nVenizelos, at that time, was in an electoral tour of the island. Once, he \"saw Canea in flames\",<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 35\u201336</ref> he hurried to [[Malaxa, Crete|Malaxa]], near Chania, where a group of about 2,000 rebels had assembled, and established himself as their header. He proposed an attack, along with other rebels, on the Turkish forces at [[Akrotiri (Crete)|Akrotiri]] in order to displace them from the plains (Malaxa is in a higher altitude). Venizelos' subsequent actions at Akrotiri form a central set-piece in his myth. People composed poems on Akrotiri and his role there; editorials and articles spoke about his bravery, his visions and his diplomatic genius as inevitable accompaniment of later greatness.<ref name=\"Kitromilides.p58\"/> Venizelos spent the night in Akrotiri and a [[Greek flag]] was raised. The [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman forces]] requested help from the foreign admirals and attacked the rebels, with the ships of the Great Powers bombarding the rebel positions at Akrotiri. A shell threw down the flag, which was raised up again immediately. The mythologizing became more pronounced when we come to his actions in that February, as the following quotes display:\n\n{{cquote|On 20th of February [he] was ordered by the admirals to lower the flag and disband his rebel force. He refused!<ref>Gibbons, p. 24</ref> }}\n\n{{cquote|Venizelos turned towards to the port of [[Souda]], where the warships were anchored and explained: \"You have cannon-balls \u2013 fire away!

He wrote that the rebels would keep their positions until everyone is killed from the shells of European warships, in order not to let the Turks remain in Crete.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, pp. 63\u201364</ref> The letter was deliberately leaked to international newspapers, evoking emotional reactions in Greece and in Europe, where the idea of Christians, who wanted their freedom, being bombarded by Christian vessels, caused popular indignation. Throughout western Europe much popular sympathy for the cause of the Christians in Crete was manifested, and much popular applause was bestowed on the Greeks.<ref name=\"Dunningp367\"/>\n\n====War in Thessaly====\n{{details|Greco-Turkish War (1897)}}\n[[File:Balkans-ethnique.JPG|right|thumb|Ethnic composition of the Balkans according to the Atlas G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vidal-Lablache, Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1898.]]\n[[File:Edward Stanford 1877.jpg|right|thumb|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] by the Greek diplomat Ioannis Gennadius,<ref>Understanding life in the borderlands: boundaries in depth and in motion, I.

On 27 April 1899, the High Commissioner created an Executive Committee composed of the Cretan leaders. Venizelos became minister of Justice and with the rest of the Committee, they began to organize the State and create a \"Cretan constitution\". Venizelos insisted to not be made reference on religion, so all the residents of Crete to feel represented. For his stance was later accused as pro-Turk (pro-Muslim) by his political opponents on the island.\n\nAfter Venizelos submitted the complete juridical legislation on 18 May 1900, disagreements between him and Prince George began to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Prince George decided to travel to Europe and announced to the Cretan population that \"When I am traveling in Europe I shall ask the Powers for annexation, and I hope to succeed on account of my family connections\".<ref name=\"Kerofiliasp30-31\">Kerofilias, 1915, pp. 30\u201331</ref> The statement reached the public without the knowledge or approval of the Committee. Venizelos said to the Prince that it would not be proper to give hope to the population for something that wasn't feasible at the given moment. As Venizelos had expected, during the Prince's journey, the Great Powers rejected his request.<ref name=\"SU2\"/><ref name=\"Kerofiliasp30-31\"/>\n\nThe disagreements continued on other topics; the Prince wanted to build a palace, but Venizelos strongly opposed it as that would mean perpetuation of the current arrangement of Governorship; Cretans accepted it only as temporary, until a final solution was found.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> Relations between the two men became increasingly soured, and Venizelos repeatedly submitted his resignation.<ref>Kerofilias, 1915, p. 33</ref>\n\nIn a meeting of the Executive Committee, Venizelos expressed his opinion that the island was not in essence autonomous, since militarily forces of the Great Powers were still present, and that the Great Powers were governing through their representative, the Prince. Venizelos suggested that once the Prince's service expired, then the Great Powers should be invited to the Committee, which, according to article 39 of the constitution (which was suppressed in the conference of Rome) would elect a new sovereign, thereby removing the need for the presence of the Great Powers. Once the Great Powers' troops left the island along with their representatives, then the union with Greece would be easier to achieve. This proposal was exploited by Venizelos' opponents, who accused him that he wanted Crete as an autonomous hegemony. Venizelos replied to the accusations by submitting once again his resignation, with the reasoning that for him it would be impossible henceforth to collaborate with the Committee's members; he assured the Commissioner however that he did not intend to join the opposition.<ref name=\"SU2\"/>\n\nOn 6 March 1901, in a report, he exposed the reasons that compelled him to resign to the High Commissioner, which was however leaked to the press. On 20 March, Venizelos was dismissed, because \"he, without any authorization, publicly supported opinions opposite of those of the Commissioner\".<ref name=\"SU2\"/><ref>Chester, 1921, p. 82</ref> Henceforth, Venizelos assumed the leadership of the opposition to the Prince. For the next three years, he carried out a hard political conflict, until the administration was virtually paralyzed and tensions dominated the island. Inevitably, these events led in March 1905 to the [[Theriso]] Revolution, whose leader he was.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Revolution of Theriso===\n{{details|Theriso revolt}}\n[[File:Eleftherios Venizelos.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Venizelos at the beginning of the 20th century.]]\n\nOn 10 March 1905, the rebels gathered in Theriso and declared \"the political union of Crete with Greece as a single free constitutional state\";<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 95</ref> the resolution was given to the Great Powers, where it was argued that the illegitimate provisional arrangement was preventing the island's economic growth and that the only logical solution to the \"Cretan Question\" was the unification with Greece. The High Commissioner, with the approval of the Great Powers, replied to the rebels that military force would be used against them.<ref name=\"SU2\"/> However, more deputies joined with Venizelos in Theriso.

On 18 July, the Great Powers declared martial law, but that did not discourage the rebels. On 15 August, the regular assembly in Chania voted in favor of most of the reforms that Venizelos proposed. The Great Powers' consuls met Venizelos again and accepted the reforms he had proposed. This led to the end of the Theriso revolt and to the resignation of Prince George as the High Commissioner.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Great Powers assigned the authority for selecting the island's new High Commissioner to King George I of Greece, thereby ''de facto'' nullifying the Ottoman suzerainty. An ex-Prime Minister of Greece, [[Alexandros Zaimis]], was chosen for the place of High Commissioner, and Greek officers and non-commissioned officers were allowed to undertake the organization of the [[Cretan Gendarmerie]]. As soon as the Gendarmerie was organized, the foreign troops began to withdraw from the island. This was also a personal victory for Venizelos, who as a result achieved fame not only in Greece but also in Europe.<ref name=\"SU2\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Young Turk Revolution]], which Venizelos welcomed, Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire on 5 October 1908, and one day later [[Franz Joseph]], [[Emperor of Austria]] announced the [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Encouraged by these events, on the same day, the Cretans in turn rose up. Thousands of citizens in Chania and the surrounding regions on that day formed a rally, in which Venizelos declared the union of Crete with Greece. Having communicated with the government of [[Athens]], Zaimis left for Athens before the rally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAn assembly was convened and declared the independence of Crete. The civil servants were sworn in the name of King George I of Greece, while a five-member Executive Committee was established, with the authority to control the island on behalf of the King and according to the laws of the Greek state. Chairman of the committee was Antonios Michelidakis and Venizelos became Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs. In April 1910 a new assembly was convened and Venizelos was elected chairman and then Prime Minister.

His proposals were considered by the King and the Greek politicians dangerous for the political establishment. However, King George I, fearing an escalation of the crisis, convened a council with political leaders, and recommended them to accept Venizelos' proposals. After many postponements the King agreed to assign [[Stephanos Dragoumis]] (Venizelos' indication) to form a new government that would lead the country to elections once the League was disbanded.<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 129\u2013133</ref> In the elections of 8 August 1910, almost half the seats in the parliament were won by Independents, who were newcomers to the Greek political scene. Venizelos, despite doubts as to the validity of his Greek citizenship and without having campaigned in person, finished at the top at the electoral list in [[Attica]]. He was immediately recognized as the leader of the independents and thus he founded the political party, ''[[Komma Fileleftheron]]'' (Liberal Party). Soon after his election he decided to call for new elections in hope of winning an [[absolute majority]]. The old parties boycotted the new election in protest<ref name=\"Mazo886\">Mazower, 1992, p. 886</ref> and on 11 December 1910, Venizelos' party [[November 1910 Greek legislative election|won 307 seats out of 362]], with most of the elected citizens being new in the political scene.  Venizelos formed a government and started to reorganize the economic, political, and national affairs of the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Reforms in 1910\u20131914===\nVenizelos tried to advance his reform program in the realms of political and social ideologies, of education, and literature, by adopting practically viable compromises between often conflicting tendencies. In education, for example, the dynamic current in favor of the use of the popular spoken language, [[dimotiki]], provoked conservative reactions, which led to the constitutionally embedded decision (Article 107) in favor of a formal \"purified\" language, [[katharevousa]], which looked back to classical precedents.<ref name=\"NF1910\">{{cite web |last=Gardika-Katsiadaki |first=Eleni |title=Period 1910 \u2013 1914 |publisher=National Foundation Research |year=2008 |url=http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio10-14.jsp |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233429/http://www.venizelos-foundation.gr/endocs/bio10-14.jsp |archivedate = 18 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 May 1911, a revision of the Constitution was completed, which focused on strengthening individual freedoms, introducing measures to facilitate the legislative work of the Parliament, establishing of obligatory [[elementary education]], the legal right for compulsory [[Nationalization|expropriation]], ensuring permanent appointment for civil servants, the right to invite foreign personnel to undertake the reorganization of the administration  and the armed forces, the re-establishment of the State Council and the simplification of the procedures for the reform of the Constitution. The aim of the reform program was to consolidate public security and rule of law as well as to develop and increase the wealth-producing potential of the country. In this context, the long planned \"eighth\" Ministry, the [[Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism (Greece)|Ministry of National Economy]], assumed a leading role. This Ministry, from the time of its creation at the beginning of 1911, was headed by [[Emmanuel Benakis]], a wealthy Greek merchant from [[Egypt]] and friend of Venizelos.<ref name=\"NF1910\"/> Between 1911 and 1912 a number of laws aiming to initiate [[labor legislation]] in Greece were promulgated. Specific measures were enacted that prohibited child labor and night-shift work for women, that regulated the hours of the working week and the Sunday holiday, and allowed for labor organizations.<ref>Kyriakou, 2002, pp. 491\u2013492</ref> Venizelos also took measures for the improvement of management, justice and security and for the settlement of the landless peasants of Thessaly.<ref name=\"NF1910\"/>\n\n===Balkan Wars===\n{{details|Balkan Wars}}\n\n====Background====\n[[Image:Balkans at 1905.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The boundaries of the Balkan states before the [[Balkan Wars]].]]\n\nAt the time there were diplomatic contacts with the [[Ottoman Empire]] to initiate reforms in Macedonia and in [[Thrace]], which at the time were under the control of the Ottoman Empire, for improving the living conditions of the Christian populations. Failure of such reforms would leave as a single option to remove Ottoman Empire from the [[Balkans]], an idea that most Balkan countries shared. This scenario appeared realistic to Venizelos, because Ottoman Empire was under a [[Young Turks|constitutional transition]] and its administrative mechanism was disorganized and weakened.<ref>Hall, 2000, pp. 1\u20139</ref> There was also no fleet capable of transporting forces from [[Asia Minor]] to Europe, while in contrast the Greek fleet was dominating the [[Aegean Sea]]. Venizelos did not want to initiate any immediate major movements in the Balkans, until the Greek army and navy were reorganized (an effort that had begun from the last government of [[Georgios Theotokis]]) and the Greek economy was revitalized.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 141</ref> In light of this, Venizelos proposed to Ottoman Empire to recognize the Cretans the right to send deputies to the Greek Parliament, as a solution for closing the ''Cretan Question''. However, the [[Young Turks]] (feeling confident after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war in 1897]]) threatened that they would make a military walk to Athens, if the Greeks insisted on such claims.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Balkan League====\n{{details|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and Eleftherios Venizelos-cropped.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|With the Serbian Prime Minister [[Nikola Pasic]] in 1913]]\nVenizelos, seeing no improvements after his approach with the Turks on the ''Cretan Question'' and at the same time not wanting to see Greece remain inactive as in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War in 1877]] (where Greece's neutrality left the country out of the peace talks), he decided that the only way to settle the disputes with Ottoman Empire, was to join the other Balkan countries, [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Montenegro]], in an alliance known as the [[Balkan League]]. [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine]] was sent to represent Greece to a royal feast in [[Sofia]], and in 1911 Bulgarian students were invited to Athens.<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 150</ref> These events had a positive impact and on 30 May 1912 Greece and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] signed a treaty that ensured mutual support in case of a Turkish attack on either country. Negotiations with Serbia, which Venizelos had initiated to achieve a similar agreement, were concluded in early 1913,<ref name=\"Kitromilidesp145\">Kitromilides, 2006, p. 145</ref> before that there were only oral agreements.<ref>Hall, 2000, p. 13</ref>\n\nMontenegro opened hostilities by declaring war on Turkey on 8 October 1912.

The Greek population received these developments very enthusiastically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====First Balkan War \u2013 The first conflict with Prince Constantine====\n{{details|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:158 14 Constantin Venizelos.jpg|thumb|Venizelos with Constantine]]\n\nThe outbreak of the First Balkan war caused Venizelos a great deal of trouble in his relations with Crown Prince Constantine. Part of the problems can be attributed to the complexity of the official relations between the two men. Although Constantine was a Prince and the future King, he also held the title of army commander, thus remaining under the direct order of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and subsequently under Venizelos. But his father, King George, in accordance to the constitutional conditions of the time had been the undisputed leader of the country. Thus in practical terms Venizelos' authority over his commander of the army was diminished due to the obvious relation between the Crown Prince and the King.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn these conditions the army started a victorious march to Macedonia under the command of Constantine. Soon the first disagreement between Venizelos and Constantine emerged, and it concerned the aims of the army's operations. The Crown Prince insisted on the clear military aims of the war: to defeat the opposed Ottoman army as a necessary condition for any occupation, wherever the opponent army was or was going; and the main part of the Ottoman army soon started retreating to the north towards [[Bitola|Monastir]]. Venizelos was more realistic and insisted on the political aims of the war: to liberate as many geographical areas and cities as fast as possible, particularly Macedonia and Thessaloniki; thus heading east. The debate became evident after the victory of the Greek army at [[Battle of Sarantaporo|Sarantaporo]], when the future direction of the armys' march was to be decided. Venizelos intervened and insisted that [[Thessaloniki]], as a major city and [[Port of Thessaloniki|strategic port]] in the surrounding area, should be taken at all costs and thus a turn to the east was necessary.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In accordance to his views, Venizelos sent the following telegraph to the General Staff:\n\n{{cquote|Salonique \u00e0 tout prix!<ref name=\"Chesterp159-160\">Chester, 1921, pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n\n[[Image:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913.]]\n\nand tried to keep frequent communication with the key figure, the King, in order to prevent the Prince from marching north.<ref name=\"Chesterp159-160\"/> Subsequently, although the Greek army won the [[Battle of Giannitsa|Giannitsa battle]] situated 40&nbsp;km west of Salonika, Constantine's hesitation in capturing the city after a week had passed, led into an open confrontation with Venizelos. Venizelos, having accurate information from the Greek embassy in Sofia about the movement of the Bulgarian army towards the city, sent a telegram to Constantine in a strict tone, holding him responsible for the possible loss of Thessaloniki. The tone in Venizelos' telegram and that in the answer from Constantine that followed to announce the final agreement with the Turks, is widely considered as the start of the conflict between the two men that would lead Greece into the National Schism during World War I. Finally on 26 October 1912, the Greek army entered [[Thessaloniki]], shortly ahead of the [[Bulgarians]].<ref>Hall, 2000, pp. 61\u201362</ref> But soon a new reason of friction emerged due to Venizelos' concern about Constantine's acceptance of the Bulgarian request to enter the city. A small Bulgarian unit, which soon became a full division moved into the city and immediately started an attempt to establish a condominium in spite of initial assurances to the contrary, showing no intentions to leave. After Venizelos' protest Constantine asked him to take the responsibility (as a prime minister) by ordering him to force them out, but that was hardly an option since that would certainly lead to confrontation with the Bulgarians. To Venizelos' view, since Constantine allowed the Bulgarians to enter the city, he now passed the responsibility of a possible conflict with them to him, in an attempt to deny his initial fault. To Constantine, it was an attempt by Venizelos to get involved in clearly military issues. Most historians agree that Constantine failed to see the political dimensions of his decisions. As a consequence both incidents increased mutual misunderstanding, shortly before Constantine's accession to the throne.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nOnce the campaign in Macedonia was completed, a large part of the Greek army under the Crown Prince was redeployed to [[Epirus]], and in the [[Battle of Bizani]] the Ottoman positions were overcome and [[Ioannina]] taken on 22 February 1913. Meanwhile, the Greek navy rapidly occupied the Aegean islands still under Ottoman rule. After two victories, the Greek fleet established naval supremacy over the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements to the Balkans.<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 161\u2013164</ref><ref>Hall, 2000, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 20 November, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria signed a truce treaty with Turkey. It followed a conference in London, in which Greece took part, although the Greek army still continued its operations in the Epirus front. The conference led to the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] between the Balkan countries and Turkey. \u03a4hese two conferences gave the first indications of Venizelos' diplomatic efficiency and realism. During the negotiations and facing the dangers of Bulgarian maximalism, Venizelos succeeded in establishing close relations with the Serbs. A Serbian-Greek military protocol was signed on 1 June 1913 ensuring mutual protection in case of a Bulgarian attack.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Second Balkan War====\n{{details|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:Demonstration in Greece during Balkan Wars.jpg|thumb|220px|Demonstration in Greece during the Balkan Wars with the words \"Long Live Venizelos\".]]\n[[File:Participants in the Bucharest Peace Treaty negotiations, 1913.jpg|thumb|Venizelos with other participants in Bucharest peace treaty negotiations]]\nDespite all this, the Bulgarians still wanted to become a hegemonic power in the Balkans and made excessive claims to this end, while Serbia asked for more territory than what was initially agreed with the Bulgarians. Serbia was asking for a revision of the original treaty, since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers' decision to establish the state of Albania, in an area that had been recognized as a Serbian territory of expansion under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Bulgarians also laid claims on Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia. In the conference of London, Venizelos rebuffed these claims, citing the fact that it had been occupied by the Greek army,<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 169</ref> and that Bulgaria had denied any definite settlement of territorial claims during the pre-war discussions, as it had done with Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe rupture between the allies, due to the Bulgarian claims, was inevitable, and Bulgaria found herself standing against Greece and Serbia. On 19 May 1913, [[Greek-Serbian Alliance of 1913|a pact of alliance]] was signed in Thessaloniki between Greece and Serbia. On 19 June, the Second Balkan War began with a surprise Bulgarian assault against Serbian and Greek positions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Bulgaria, The Balkan Wars | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008  |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-42742 }}</ref> Constantine, now King after [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|his father's assassination in March]], neutralized the Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki and pushed the Bulgarian army further back with a series of hard-fought victories.

The Bulgarians asked for truce. Venizelos went to [[Vyroneia|Hadji-Beylik]], where the Greek headquarters were, to confer with Constantine on the Greek territorial claims in the peace conference. Then he went to [[Bucharest]], where a peace conference was assembled. On 28 June 1913 a [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|peace treaty]] was signed with Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Romania on one side and Bulgaria on the other.

Greece had an active treaty with Serbia which was the treaty activated in the 1913 Bulgarian attack that caused the Second Balkan War. That treaty was envisaged in a purely Balkan context, and was thus invalid against [[Austria-Hungary]], as was supported by Constantine and his advisors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe situation changed when the Allies, in an attempt to help Serbia, offered Bulgaria the [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]]\u2013[[Ochrid]] area of Serbia and the Greek Eastern Macedonia (the [[Kavala]] and [[Drama, Greece|Drama]] areas) if she joined the Entente. Venizelos, having received assurances over Asia Minor if the Greeks participated in the alliance, agreed to cede the area to Bulgaria.<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 154</ref>\n\nBut Constantine's anti-Bulgarism made such a transaction impossible. Constantine refused to go to war under such conditions and the men parted. As a consequence Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] and invaded Serbia, an event leading to Serbia's final collapse. Greece remained neutral. Venizelos supported an alliance with the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], not only believing that Britain and France would win, but also that it was the only choice for Greece, because the combination of the strong Anglo-French naval control over the Mediterranean and the geographical distribution of the Greek population, could have ill effects in the case of a naval blockade, as he characteristically remarked:\n\n{{cquote| One cannot kick against geography!<ref>Seligman, 1920, p. 31</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Constantine favored the [[Central Powers]] and wanted Greece to remain neutral.<ref name=\"BA3\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=World War I \u2013 Greek Affairs | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53151}}</ref> He was influenced both by his belief in the military superiority of [[German Empire|Germany]] and also by his German wife, [[Sophia of Prussia|Queen Sophia]], and his pro-German court.

A small scale mobilisation of the Greek army took place.\n\nThe dispute between Venizelos and the King reached its height shortly after that and the King invoked a [[Greek Constitution of 1911|Greek constitutional provision]] that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government unilaterally. Meanwhile, using the excuse of saving Serbia, in October 1915, the Entente disembarked an army in Thessaloniki,<ref name=\"BA5\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Constantine I | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9025982}}</ref> after invitation by Venizelos. This action of Prime Minister Venizelos enraged Constantine.\n\nThe dispute continued between the two men, and in December 1915 Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling for [[December 1915 Greek legislative election|new elections]]. Venizelos left Athens and moved back to Crete. Venizelos did not take part in the elections, as he considered the dissolution of Parliament unconstitutional.<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 271</ref><ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 122</ref>\n\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|left|The 1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches before the White Tower on its way to the front.]]\n\nOn 26 May 1916 the [[Fort Roupel|Fort Rupel]] (a significant military fort in Macedonia) was unconditionally surrendered by the royalist government to Germano-Bulgarian forces.<ref>Leon, 1974, pp. 356\u20137</ref> This produced a deplorable impression. The Allies feared a possible secret alliance between the royalist government and Central Powers placing in grave danger of their armies in Macedonia. On the other hand, the surrender of Fort Rupel for Venizelos and his supporters meant the beginning of the destruction of Greek Macedonia. Despite German assurances that the integrity of the Kingdom of Greece would be respected they were unable to restrain the Bulgarian forces, which had started dislocating the Greek population, and by 4 September [[Kavala]] was occupied.<ref>Leon, 1974, p. 381</ref>\n\nOn 16 August 1916, during a rally in Athens, and with the support of the allied army that had landed in Thessaloniki under the command of General [[Maurice Sarrail]], Venizelos announced publicly his total disagreement with the Crown's policies. The effect of this was to further polarize the population between the [[Monarchism|royalists]] (also known as ''anti-Venezelists''), who supported the crown, and [[Venizelist]]s, who supported Venizelos. On 30 August 1916, Venizelist army officers organized a military coup in Thessaloniki, and proclaimed the \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\". Venizelos along with Admiral [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]] and General [[Panagiotis Danglis]] agreed to form a provisional government and on 9 October they moved to Thessaloniki and assumed command of the National Defence to oversee the Greek participation in the allied war effort. The triumvirate, as the three men became known, had formed this government in direct conflict with the Athens political establishment.<ref name=\"Kitromilides2008p124\">Kitromilides, 2008, p. 124</ref> There they founded a separate \"provisional state\" including Northern Greece, Crete and the Aegean Islands, with the support of the Entente.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 87</ref> Primarily, these areas comprised the \"New Lands\" won during the Balkan Wars, in which Venizelos enjoyed a broad support, while \"Old Greece\" was mostly pro-royalist. However, Venizelos declared \"we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians\". He didn't want to abolish the monarchy and continued his efforts to persuade the King to join the Allies, blaming his \"bad advisors\" for his stance.\n\nThe National Defence government started assembling an army for the Macedonian front and soon participated in operations against the [[Central Powers]] forces.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====\"Noemvriana\" \u2013 Greece enters World War I====\n{{details|Noemvriana}}\n[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|French troops in Athens, with the Acropolis in the background, after the ''Noemvriana''.]]\n\nIn the following months after the creation of provisional government in Thessaloniki in late August, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilisation of the Greek army as a counterbalance of the unconditional surrender of Fort Rupel by the royalist government and military evacuation of Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. On the other hand, the king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognise Venizelos' provisional government or further support it, guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected, and a promise that any war material surrendered to the Allies would be returned after the war.<ref name=\"Leon1974p422\">Leon, 1974, p. 422</ref>\n\nThe Franco-British use of Greece's territory in co-operation with the Venizelos government {{cref|i}} throughout 1916 was opposed in royalist circles and therefore increased Constantine's popularity, and caused much excitement and several anti-Allied demonstrations took place in Athens.<ref name=\"Kitromilides2008p124\"/>  Moreover, a growing movement had been developed in the army among lower officers, led by military officers [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and [[Sofoklis Dousmanis]], determined to oppose disarmament and the surrender of any war materials to the Allies.<ref>Leon, 1974, p. 428</ref>\n\n[[Image:Venizelos WWI 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Venizelos reviews a section of the Greek army on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] during the First World War, 1918.

On the next day, 24 November, du Fournet presented a new ultimatum ending on 1 December to the government of Athens demanding the immediate surrender of at least ten mountain batteries.<ref name=Leon1974p434>Leon, 1974, p. 434</ref> The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands.

However, he promised that the Greek forces would receive orders not to fire against the Allied contingent.<ref name=Leon1974p435>Leon, 1974, p. 435</ref>  Despite the gravity of the situation both the royalist government and the Allies let the events take their own course. The royalist government decided to reject the admiral's demands on 29 November and armed resistance was organised. By 30 November military units and royalist militia (the ''epistratoi'', \"reservists\") from surrounding areas have been recalled and gathered in and around Athens (in total over 20,000 men<ref>Chester, 1921, p. 293</ref><ref>Seligman, 1920, p. 139</ref><ref>Ion, 1918, pp. 796\u2013812</ref>) and occupied strategic positions, with orders not to fire unless fired upon.<ref name=Leon1974p435 /> On the other hand, the Allied authorities failed in their assessment of the prevailing temper. A diplomat characteristically insisted that the Greeks were bluffing, and in the face of force they would ''\"bring the cannons on a plater\"''; a viewpoint that Du Fournet also shared.<ref name=Leon1974p435 />\n\n[[File:Leaders of Allied Powers in World War I.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph depicting Venizelos along with the principal Allied leaders of World War I, David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, Ferdinand Foch and Woodrow Wilson.]]\nThe Allies landed a small contingent in Athens on {{OldStyleDate|1 December|1916|18 November}}. However, it met organized resistance and an armed confrontation took place for a day till a compromise was reached. After the evacuation of the Allied contingent from Athens the following day, a royalist mob raged though the city for three days targeting supporters of Venizelos. The incident became known as the Noemvriana in Greece, which was using the Old Style calendar at the time, and drove a deep wedge between the Venizelists and their political opponents, deepening what would become known as the [[National Schism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAfter the armed confrontation in Athens, on {{OldStyleDate|2 December|1916|19 November}}, Britain and France officially recognised the government under Venizelos as the lawful government, effectively splitting Greece into two separate entities.<ref>Burg, 1998, pp. 145\u20136</ref> On {{OldStyleDate|7 December|1916|24 November}}, Venizelos' provisional government officially declared war on the Central Powers.<ref>Vatikotes, 1998 p. 98</ref><ref>Burg, 1998, p.145</ref> In reply, a royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was issued and the [[Archbishop of Athens]], under pressure by the royal house,<ref>Kitromilides, 2006, p. 367</ref> [[anathema]]tised him.<ref>Hickey, 2004, p. 87</ref> The Allies unwilling to risk a new fiasco, but determined to solve the problem, established a naval blockade around southern Greece, which was still loyal to the king, and that caused extreme hardship to people in those areas.<ref name=\"Clogg2002p89\">Clogg, 2002, p. 89</ref> In June France and Great Britain decided to invoke their obligation as ''\"protecting powers\"'', who had promised to guarantee a constitutional form for Greece at the time the Kingdom was created, to demand the king's resignation.<ref>Gibbons, 1920, p. 299</ref> Constantine accepted and on 15 June 1917 went to exile, leaving his son Alexander on the throne as demanded (whom the Allies considered as pro-Entente), instead of his elder son and crown prince, [[George II of Greece|George]].<ref>Chester, 1921, pp. 295\u2013304</ref><ref name=\"TA1\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764941-2,00.html Land of Invasion], [[Time (magazine)|TIME]], 4 November 1940</ref> His departure was followed by the deportation of many prominent royalists, especially army officers such as [[Ioannis Metaxas]], to exile in France and Italy.\n\nThe course of events paved the way for Venizelos to return in Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially entered the war on the side of the Allies. Subsequently, the entire Greek army was mobilized (though tensions remained inside the army between supporters of the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|monarchy]] and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the [[Central Powers]] army on the Macedonian front.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Conclusion of World War I====\n{{See also|Battle of Skra-di-Legen|Armistice of Thessalonica|Armistice of Mudros|Occupation of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Greek Parade Paris 1919.jpg|thumb|left|Painting depicting Greek military units in the World War I Victory Parade in [[Arc de Triomphe]], Paris.

Under the command of French General [[Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]], a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], starting on 14 September 1918. After the first heavy fighting (see [[Battle of Skra-di-Legen|Battle of Skra]]) the Bulgarians gave up their defensive positions and began retreating back towards their country. On 24 September the Bulgarian government asked for an [[Armistice with Bulgaria (World War I)|armistice]], which was signed five days later.<ref>The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1922, p. 308</ref>  The Allied army then pushed north and defeated the remaining German and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian forces]] that tried to halt the Allied offensive. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918 marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The breaking of the Macedonian front was one of the important breakthroughs of the military stalemate and helped to bring an end to the War.

Firstly Venizelos signed an agreement on 23 September 1928 with [[Benito Mussolini]] in Rome, and then he started negotiations with Yugoslavia which resulted in a Treaty of Friendship signed on 27 March 1929. An additional protocol settled the status of the Yugoslav [[free trade zone]] of Thessaloniki in a way favorable to Greek interests.<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, p. 55, 70</ref> Nevertheless, despite the co-ordinated British efforts under [[Arthur Henderson]] in 1930\u20131931, full reconciliation with Bulgaria was never achieved during his premiership.<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, pp. 144\u2013146</ref> Venizelos was also cautious towards [[Albania]], and although bilateral relations remained at a good level, no initiative was taken by either side aiming at the final settlement of the unresolved issues (mainly related with the status of the Greek minority of South Albania).<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, pp. 158\u2013160</ref>\n\n[[File:AtaturkAndVenizelos.jpg|thumb|left|200px|With [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] in [[Ankara]]; 27 October 1930.]]\n[[File:Eleftherios Venizelos 1930 (2).JPG|thumb|200px|Venizelos, wearing his typical side cap, sitting at his desk (1930).]]\n[[File:\u03a4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb. \u0392\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03b6\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c6. \u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf 1933.jpg|thumb|200px|The car of Venizelos after the assassination attempt of 1933]]\n\nVenizelos' greatest achievement in foreign policy during this period was the reconciliation with Turkey. Venizelos had expressed his will to improve the bilateral Greek\u2013Turkish relations even before his electoral victory, in a speech in Thessaloniki (23 July 1928). Eleven days after the formation of his government, he sent letters to both the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs of Turkey ([[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] and [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc]] respectively), declaring that Greece had no territorial aspirations to the detriment of their country. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's response was positive and Italy was eager to help the two countries reach an agreement. Negotiations however stalled because of the complicated issue of the properties of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|exchanged populations]]. Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on 30 April 1930; on 25 October, Venizelos visited Turkey and signed a treaty of friendship. Venizelos even forwarded Atat\u00fcrk's name for the 1934 [[Nobel Peace Prize]],<ref name=nobel>Nobel Foundation. ''The Nomination Database for the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Prize in Peace]], 1901\u20131955''.[http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?action=show&showid=2046 nobelprize.org]</ref> highlighting the mutual respect between the two leaders.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 107</ref> The German [[Chancellor]] [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] described the Greek-Turkish rapprochement as the ''\"greatest achievement seen in Europe since the end of the Great War\"''. Nevertheless, Venizelos' initiative was criticized domestically not only by the opposition but also by members of his own party that represented the Greek refugees from Turkey. Venizelos was accused of making too many concessions on the issues of naval armaments and of the properties of the Greeks who were expelled from Turkey according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>Karamanlis, 1995, pp. 95\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 1929, the Venizelos government, in an effort to avoid reactions from the lower-classes whose conditions had worsened due to wave of immigration, introduced the so-called [[Idionymon]] (#4229), a law that restricted civil liberties and initiated the repression against [[Trade union|unionism]], left-wing supporters and [[communism|communists]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nHis domestic position was weakened, however, by the effects of the [[Great Depression]] in the early 1930s;<ref>Black, 1948, p. 94</ref> and in the [[1932 Greek legislative election|elections of 1932]] he was defeated by the [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]] under [[Panagis Tsaldaris]]. The political climate became more tense and in 1933 Venizelos was the target of a second assassination attempt.<ref>Clogg, 2002, p. 103</ref> The pro-royalist tendencies of the new government led to two Venizelist coup attempts by General [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]: one in 1933 and the other in 1935. The failure of the [[Greek coup attempt of 1935|latter]] proved decisive for the future of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]]. After the coup's failure Venizelos left Greece once more, while in Greece trials and executions of prominent Venizelists were carried out and he himself was sentenced to death ''in absentia''. The severely weakened Republic was abolished in another coup in October 1935 by General [[Georgios Kondylis]] and George II returned to the throne following a rigged [[1935 Greek plebiscite|referendum]] in November.<ref>Black, 1948, pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Death==\nVenizelos left for Paris and on 12 March 1936 wrote his last letter to Alexandros Zannas. He suffered a stroke on the morning of the 13th and died five days later in his flat at 22 rue Beaujon.<ref>Manolikakis, 1985, pp. 18\u201322; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Veniselos, ''A l'ombre de Veniselos'' (Paris, 1955)</ref> The absolution was performed on 21 March at [[St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral, Paris|St. Stephen's Greek Orthodox Church]]; his body was deposed in the crypt before its transportation on the 23rd at the beginning of the afternoon to the [[Gare de Lyon]]. His body was then taken by the [[destroyer]] [[Greek destroyer Kountouriotis (D 99)|''Pavlos Kountouriotis'']] to Chania, avoiding Athens in order not to cause unrest. A great ceremony with wide public attendance accompanied his burial at Akrotiri, Crete.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:EleftheriosVenizelosGraveCloseup.jpg|thumb|Venizelos' gravestone in Akrotiri, near [[Chania]], [[Crete]].]]\n[[File:Venizelos Theriso2.JPG|thumb|A statue in [[Theriso]], Crete.]]\nOne of the main contributions of Venizelos to Greek political life was the creation, in 1910, of the Liberal Party, which contrasted with the Greek parties of that period. Until the early twentieth century, the Greek parties were inspired by the protecting powers ([[French Party (Greece)|French]] or [[English Party (Greece)|English Party]] for example) or clustered around a political personality, such as [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]. The Liberal Party was based around the ideas of Venizelos (and the military coup of Goudi), but it survived its creator. In addition, the birth of a leading party would coincide with the birth of an opposing party. The opposing party was reflected around the personality of the king, but that survived the various abolitions of the monarchy.<ref>Koliopoulos, 2002, p. 53-54</ref> [[Venizelism]], from its inception, is essentially a liberal Republican movement, which opposes anti-venizelist monarchist and conservative ideologies. These two competed for power throughout the inter-war period.<ref>Legg, p. 188-189</ref>\n\nIts main ideas, adapted from its creator, were: opposition to the monarchy; the defence of the Megali Idea; formation of alliances with western democratic countries, in particular the United Kingdom and France against Germany during the First and Second World Wars, and later with the United States against the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]]; and finally a protectionist economic policy.<ref>Contogeorgis, 1996, p. 379-404</ref>\n\n[[Themistoklis Sofoulis]] was, from the 1920s, the successor of Venizelos as leader of the Liberal Party, which survived policy failures, exile and ultimately death of the historical founder. In 1950, the son of Venizelos, Sophoklis Venizelos, succeeded as head of the Liberal Party at a time when an agreement was formed with the populists (name of the royalist party) against the communists during the civil war. The [[Center Union]] (Enosis Kendrou), founded in 1961 by [[George Papandreou (senior)|Georgios Papandreou]], became the ideological descendant of the Liberal Party. The Center Union eventually fade in the late 1970s and was replaced by a party further to the left, [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] of [[Andreas Papandreou]].<ref>Koliopoulos, 2002, p. 104</ref>\n\n==Personal life and family==\nIn December 1891 Venizelos married Maria Katelouzou, daughter of Eleftherios Katelouzos. The newlyweds lived in the upper floor of the Chalepa house, while Venizelos' mother and his brother and sisters lived on the ground floor. There, they enjoyed the happy moments of their marriage and also had the birth of their two children, {{Interlanguage link multi|Kyriakos Venizelos{{!}}Kyriakos|el|3=\u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03b6\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} in 1892 and [[Sofoklis Venizelos|Sofoklis]] in 1894. Their married life was short and marked by misfortune. Maria died of post-puerperal fever in November 1894 after the birth of their second child. Her death deeply affected Venizelos and as sign of mourning he grew his characteristic beard and mustache, which he retained for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"SI1\"/>\n\nAfter his defeat in the November elections of 1920 he left for [[Nice]] and Paris in self-imposed exile. In September 1921, twenty-seven years after the death of his first wife Maria, he married [[Helena Schilizzi]] (sometimes referred to as Elena Skylitsi or Stephanovich) in London. Advised by police to be wary of assassination attempts, they held the religious ceremony in private at [[Witanhurst]], the mansion of family friend and socialite, [[Arthur Henry Crosfield|Lady Domini Crosfield]]. The Crosfields were well connected and Venizelos met [[Arthur Balfour]], [[David Lloyd George]] and the arms dealer [[Basil Zaharoff]] in subsequent visits to the house.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe married couple settled down in Paris in a flat at 22 rue Beaujon.{{Clarify|date=December 2015 |reason=Unlikely or at least imprecise, as he was Prime Minister & President of Parliament in 1924}} He lived there until 1927 when he returned to Chania.<ref name=\"SI1\"/>\n\n=== Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree ===\n{{Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greece|Biography}}\n* [[History of Modern Greece]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Venizelos shop Chania.JPG|Venizelos father's shop in [[Chania]].\nFile:Eleftherios Venizelos, portrait 1935.jpg|Venizelos in 1935\nFile:Photo 2 Immeuble 22 rue Beaujon, Paris.jpg|Building 22 rue Beaujon in Paris where Venizelos died.\nFile:Venizelosthes.jpg|A statue in [[Thessaloniki]] (sculpt.

Party elders such as [[Hua Guofeng]] and [[Wu De]], who were not close allies of the Gang of Four, expressed criticism at the protesters and some of their slogans which were critical of the Gang of Four and party leadership. Meanwhile, the Gang of Four seemed to have been alarmed by the personal attacks at the event, and began to use their controlled newspapers to accuse Deng Xiaoping of encouraging and controlling the protesters.<ref name=Cheng>Cheng, Nien, (1996).

On the morning of 5 April, crowds gathering around the memorial arrived to discover that it had been completely removed by the police during the night, angering them. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot, in which police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.<ref name=\"Spence\"/>\n\nIn response, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the decision to forcefully clear Tiananmen Square of mourners.<ref name=Revisited /> Security forces under the PLA's Beijing detachment, alongside urban militia under the control of the [[Gang of Four]], went into the Square to forcefully clear the area.<ref name=Revisited /> The militia were reported to have been carrying wooden clubs and leather belts.<ref name=Revisited> Teiwes, Frederick C. and Warren Sun, \"The First Tiananmen Incident Revisited: Elite Politics and Crisis Management at the End of the Maoist Era,\" Pacific Affairs Vol:77 Issue:2 (2004) pp. 211\u2013235.</ref> Approximately 40 arrests occurred and with no casualties, and by the morning of April 6, all articles of mourning had been removed.<ref name=Revisited />\n\nBy 6:00 pm, most of the crowd had dispersed, but a small group remained until 10:00 pm, when a security force entered Tiananmen Square and arrested them. Many of those arrested were later sentenced to \"people's trial\" at [[Peking University]], or were sentenced to prison work camps. Incidents similar to those which occurred in Beijing on 4 and 5 April occurred in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Taiyuan]], [[Changchun]], [[Shanghai]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]. Possibly because of his close association with Zhou, Deng Xiaoping was formally stripped of all positions \"inside and outside the Party\" on 7 April, following this \"[[Tiananmen Massacre]]\".<ref name=\"Spence\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Mao's death, Hua and Wang played an important role in arresting the Gang of Four in October 1976. They subsequently expressed their opinion that the Tiananmen Incident was not a counter-revolutionary activity. Along with other party elders, they rehabilitated Deng and brought him back to Beijing. Nonetheless, Deng and his reformist allies subsequently became involved in a power struggle against Hua and Wang, who were more traditionally minded Maoists. Deng emerged as China's [[Paramount Leader]] in 1978.\n\nMany of the 1976 demonstrators had written poems in memory of Zhou Enlai and as an expression of political opposition to the political situation in China.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lattimore |first1=David |title=Politics an Poems |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/politics-an-poems.html |accessdate=12 November 2019 |publisher=New York Times |date=12 April 1981 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112145056/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/politics-an-poems.html |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Poetry created during the incident was later published in four unofficial editions by students from Beijing's Number Two Foreign Language Institute, a school with close ties to Deng Xiaoping.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraus |first1=Richard Curt |title=Brushes with Power: Modern Politics and the Chinese Art of Calligraphy |date=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0520072855 |pages=132-135 |url=http://www.tsquare.tv/film/TNMpoems.html |accessdate=12 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015124406/http://tsquare.tv/film/TNMpoems.html |archive-date=October 15, 2002 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn December 1978, at the Third Plenum of the CPC Eleventh Central Committee, the Communist Party of China reassessed its position on the Tiananmen Incident of 1976 and declared it a \"revolutionary event\", a complete rebuttal of the previous position put forward by the Party.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jian |first1=Guo |last2=Song |first2=Yongyi |last3=Zhou |first3=Yuan |title=Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution |date=17 July 2006 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810864917 |page=288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5-4zOdHKOIC&pg=PA288&lpg=PA288&dq=tiananmen+poems+1976&source=bl&ots=8zsiQoTllu&sig=ACfU3U2D55lu_q9DaoAcUQanpo6FZO-Ygg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijzdW49OTlAhVuhOAKHf3hA8w4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=tiananmen%20poems%201976&f=false |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[May Fourth Movement]]\n* [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Revolution}}\n[[Category:1976 protests]]\n[[Category:Tiananmen Square]]\n[[Category:1976 in China]]\n[[Category:20th century in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1976]]\n[[Category:Cultural Revolution]]\n[[Category:History of Beijing]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in China]]\n[[Category:Political repression in China]]\n[[Category:Protests in China]]\n[[Category:April 1976 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:Zhou Enlai]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the protest in 1976|the protest in 1989|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox civil conflict\n| title            = Tiananmen Incident\n| subtitle         = \n| partof           = \n| image            = Tiananmen Incident 1976.jpg\n| caption          = Crowds of mourners gathering in Tiananmen Square during the Qingming Festival.\n| date             = \n| place            = [[Tiananmen Square]]\n| coordinates      = \n| causes           = Death of [[Zhou Enlai]]<br>Discontent with the [[Cultural Revolution]]\n| goals            = \n| methods          = \n| status           = \n| result           = \n| side1            = [[People's Liberation Army]]<br>Militia Groups \n| side2            = Mourners <br> Protestors\n| leadfigures1     = [[Jiang Qing]]<br>[[Hua Guofeng]]\n| leadfigures2     = No centralized leadership\n| howmany1         = Unknown\n| howmany2         = 100,000\n| fatalities       = 0\n| injuries         =\n| arrests          = 40 \n| detentions       =\n| charged          =\n| fined            =\n| casualties_label = \n| notes            = \n| sidebox          = \n}}\n{{Chinese\n|s=\u56db\u4e94\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\n|t=\u56db\u4e94\u5929\u5b89\u9580\u4e8b\u4ef6\n|l=5 April Tian'anmen Incident\n|order=st\n|p=S\u00ec-W\u01d4 Ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n Sh\u00ecji\u00e0n\n|w=ssu<sup>4</sup> t`ien<sup>1</sup> an<sup>1</sup> men<sup>4</sup> shih<sup>4</sup> chien <sup>4</sup>\n|j=sei<sup>3</sup> ng<sup>5</sup> tin<sup>1</sup> ngon<sup>1</sup> mun<sup>4</sup> si<sup>6</sup> gin<sup>6</sup> \n}}\n{{History of the People's Republic of China}}\n\nThe '''Tiananmen Incident''' ({{zh|first=j|c= \u56db\u4e94\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u4e8b\u4ef6|p=s\u00ecw\u01d4 ti\u0101n'\u0101nm\u00e9n sh\u00ecji\u00e0n}} or the '''April 5 Tiananmen Incident''') took place on 5 April 1976, at [[Tiananmen Square]] in [[Beijing]], China.

Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot, in which police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.<ref name=\"Spence\"/>\n\nIn response, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the decision to forcefully clear Tiananmen Square of mourners.<ref name=Revisited /> Security forces under the PLA's Beijing detachment, alongside urban militia under the control of the [[Gang of Four]], went into the Square to forcefully clear the area.<ref name=Revisited /> The militia were reported to have been carrying wooden clubs and leather belts.<ref name=Revisited> Teiwes, Frederick C. and Warren Sun, \"The First Tiananmen Incident Revisited: Elite Politics and Crisis Management at the End of the Maoist Era,\" Pacific Affairs Vol:77 Issue:2 (2004) pp. 211\u2013235.</ref> Approximately 40 arrests occurred and with no casualties, and by the morning of April 6, all articles of mourning had been removed.<ref name=Revisited />\n\nBy 6:00 pm, most of the crowd had dispersed, but a small group remained until 10:00 pm, when a security force entered Tiananmen Square and arrested them. Many of those arrested were later sentenced to \"people's trial\" at [[Peking University]], or were sentenced to prison work camps. Incidents similar to those which occurred in Beijing on 4 and 5 April occurred in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Taiyuan]], [[Changchun]], [[Shanghai]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]. Possibly because of his close association with Zhou, Deng Xiaoping was formally stripped of all positions \"inside and outside the Party\" on 7 April, following this \"[[Tiananmen Massacre]]\".<ref name=\"Spence\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Mao's death, Hua and Wang played an important role in arresting the Gang of Four in October 1976. They subsequently expressed their opinion that the Tiananmen Incident was not a counter-revolutionary activity. Along with other party elders, they rehabilitated Deng and brought him back to Beijing. Nonetheless, Deng and his reformist allies subsequently became involved in a power struggle against Hua and Wang, who were more traditionally minded Maoists. Deng emerged as China's [[Paramount Leader]] in 1978.\n\nMany of the 1976 demonstrators had written poems in memory of Zhou Enlai and as an expression of political opposition to the political situation in China.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lattimore |first1=David |title=Politics an Poems |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/politics-an-poems.html |accessdate=12 November 2019 |publisher=New York Times |date=12 April 1981 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112145056/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/books/politics-an-poems.html |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Poetry created during the incident was later published in four unofficial editions by students from Beijing's Number Two Foreign Language Institute, a school with close ties to Deng Xiaoping.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kraus |first1=Richard Curt |title=Brushes with Power: Modern Politics and the Chinese Art of Calligraphy |date=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0520072855 |pages=132-135 |url=http://www.tsquare.tv/film/TNMpoems.html |accessdate=12 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015124406/http://tsquare.tv/film/TNMpoems.html |archive-date=October 15, 2002 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn December 1978, at the Third Plenum of the CPC Eleventh Central Committee, the Communist Party of China reassessed its position on the Tiananmen Incident of 1976 and declared it a \"revolutionary event\", a complete rebuttal of the previous position put forward by the Party.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jian |first1=Guo |last2=Song |first2=Yongyi |last3=Zhou |first3=Yuan |title=Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Cultural Revolution |date=17 July 2006 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810864917 |page=288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5-4zOdHKOIC&pg=PA288&lpg=PA288&dq=tiananmen+poems+1976&source=bl&ots=8zsiQoTllu&sig=ACfU3U2D55lu_q9DaoAcUQanpo6FZO-Ygg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijzdW49OTlAhVuhOAKHf3hA8w4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=tiananmen%20poems%201976&f=false |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[May Fourth Movement]]\n* [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Revolution}}\n[[Category:1976 protests]]\n[[Category:Tiananmen Square]]\n[[Category:1976 in China]]\n[[Category:20th century in Beijing]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1976]]\n[[Category:Cultural Revolution]]\n[[Category:History of Beijing]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in China]]\n[[Category:Political repression in China]]\n[[Category:Protests in China]]\n[[Category:April 1976 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:Zhou Enlai]]\n", "name_user": "General534", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Incident"}

The school's founders and big donors were [[Emmanuel Benakis]], namesake of the [[Benaki Museum]] of Athens, as well as the school's main building, and [[Stephanos Deltas]].  Instruction is in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and English. The school boasts a long list of successful alumni in politics, business, and the arts. Admission at either the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th grade is very selective. The school is often referred to as a power hub, due to its numerous influential alumni who remain closely connected after graduation.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe 3,000 students are divided among Athens and Psychico College, each of which includes a Kindergarten, an Elementary School, a [[middle school]], and an [[upper school]]. The upper school of Psychico College also offers students interested in studies abroad the [[International Baccalaureate]] programme.

Starting with the Three Hierarch speech competition in 10th grade and 25 March speech competition in 11th grade, the school's oratory competitions apex with the two Senior Speech competitions, Delta and Howland. The Howland prize is given to the one student who excels in public speaking in the Greek Language and the Delta Prize is given to the student whose English speech is selected first among his peers for both its content and its delivery. Both competitions include the approximately 400 students of each graduating class and have semi-finals and finals with different judging committees usually composed of people from the realm of education, diplomacy, and politics. The winners of the two competitions deliver their speeches at Commencement in July, in front of thousands of attendees.\n\nAthens College has a great tradition in [[mathematics]] competitions. The school's students are prepared in the school's Mathematics Club. Many of the school's representatives over the past few years have succeeded in national and international competitions. Also notable are the school's distinctions in competitions such as [[AMC 8]], [[AMC 10]] and [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]].  The school's Drama Club has begun a tradition the last years by earning numerous prizes, distinctions and awards in national and regional tournaments.\n\nAthens College's library is one of the largest school libraries in Europe and was the first in Greece to have all its books electronically cataloged. The sporting facilities of Athens College include a gym, two football pitches (one gravel), seven outdoor basketball courts, four outdoor tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, a track & field court, and an indoor sports center with facilities for squash, table tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, martial arts, and other events.\n\nAthens College is incorporated in both Greece and the State of New York and is a [[not-for-profit]], [[tax-exempt organization]]. Furthermore, very important for the school's spirit and an indication of its special status is its scholarship program (funded by the parents associations and the alumni club [[SAKA]]) which has given numerous students from all socioeconomic layers the opportunity to study there.\n\n== History ==\n\nAthens College was established in 1925 by a group of enlightened Greeks (Emmanuel Benakis and Stephanos Delta among them) with the support of American philhellenes, including Dr. Bert Hodge, Director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haef.gr/en/haef/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119032931/http://www.haef.gr/en/haef/history.php |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df=dmy }} Athens College Official website</ref>\n\nThe Founders\u2019 vision, which in fact was translated into reality even in the earliest years of the school\u2019s existence, revolved around the creation of a school which fostered the \"harmonious development of students\u2019 intellectual, ethical and physical capabilities, especially character\" by enhancing the existing educational system with \"modern educational methods which took into account the Greek nation\u2019s history, traditions, culture and specific needs.\"\n\n==Athens College, 1925\u20131980==\n\nThe Founding Committee of Athens College, which became its board of directors, was organized in May 1924. Its members were Epaminondas Charilaos, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, [[Bert Hodge Hill]], Director of the [[American School of Classical Studies]], [[Stephanos Delta]], retired businessman and treasurer of the [[Refugee Settlement Commission]], [[Stavros Papadakis]], [[YMCA]]. secretary, Emmanuel Benakis, retired businessman, former Minister and former Mayor of Athens, Petros Calligas, former Minister, Harold Jacquith, Director of the Near East Relief, Nicolas Kyriakides, shipowner. Later, Emmanuel Benakis who has been a major donator for the College, was named emeritus member and was replaced at the Committee by his son Antonios.\n\nThe institution has been officially recognized with the title \"Hellenic-American Educational Foundation\". The courses began in October 1925 with 15 pupils (it was a school for boys). A building was rented at Androu Street for $215 per month, and Emmanuel Benakis and Stephanos Delta covered the first expenses (\u00a32000). The first Headmaster of the College was the Englishman F. Stroud Read. The American Homer Davis, former teacher at Robert College of Constantinople, had in charge the English Department. Stephanos Delta provided for some years the needed funds for the operation of the School.\n\nIn 1926 the Greek-American Evripides Kehayas, president of [[Standard Commercial Tobacco Co]]., offered $100,000 to the College. In January 1927, a \"Board of Trustees of Athens College in Greece\" was founded at New York. The same year, Emmanuel Benakis offered to the College another $100,000 to buy land at Psychico, suburbs of Athens. Later, Benakis and Delta offered a huge supplement of $500,000. Other Greek personalities, as [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], provided more funds. A new building began to be constructed in March 1927.\nAthens College begun its operation at the new building, called Benaki Hall, in autumn 1928, with 270 pupils, 91 being boarders. President of the College from 1927 was Dr. Henry Dewing. The official opening of Benaki Hall and of the Kehayas aisle took place in May 1929. In June of the same year, graduated the first five pupils.\n\nDuring the academic year 1930\u201331, the number of the pupils reached 351, and the number of professors 44 (9 were Americans, the rest of them Greek). A seventh year was then added to the six-year Gymnasium. This supplementary year will be a particularity of Athens College.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the College had many economic difficulties, and new collects were then organized. With money from various sponsors, new buildings have been constructed, the library has been founded as well a scholarship fund.\nHomer Davis, who was Acting Director of the College after the departure of Dewing in 1930, was named its President in 1932. He will keep this charge until 1960, and will be Acting President in 1964\u201365. The Greek co-directors during those years, were Michael Michaelides-Nouaros (1925\u201327), Demetrius Georgakis (1927\u201336), Emmanuel Troulinos (1936\u201362), Constantine Lalopoulos (1962\u201373) and Sofocles Markianos (1973\u201378).\n\nThe first school-laboratories have been organized in Athens College during the 1930s, by professor of physics Panos Mavromatis. Four rooms have been provided for laboratories of physics, of chemistry, of biology and of geology. The experimental teaching has been from then a main educational policy of the College. From Athens College graduated many eminent Greek scientists, artists and politicians. This College has been an institution preparing Greek students to enter English and U.S. universities.\n\nIn 1974, after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], Athens College accepted 30 [[Greek Cypriot]] refugees into the College Boarding Department and gave them full scholarships.<ref>[http://www.cypriotdaily.com/19741711/archives/Athens-College-Bulletin_Volume-17-Number-1-Winter_1974.pdf Athens College Bulletin]. \"Cypriot Refugee Scholarship Program\" pg. 19</ref>\n\n==Athens College, 1980\u2013today==\n\nAthens College (and its sister school, Psychico College, founded in 1980) is owned by the Hellenic-American Educational Foundation, a non-profit organization with facilities located in Psychico (Middle and High Schools and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program) and Kantza in eastern Attica (two elementary schools: Bodossakio and Latsio).\n\nWhen it first began, in October 1925, Athens College occupied a rented building on 18 Androu Street in the heart of Athens. The school moved to Psychico in 1929. That same year, the Benaki Hall was dedicated by Eleftherios Venizelos, then Greece\u2019s Prime Minister and an ardent supporter of the school. In his speech during the dedication ceremony, Venizelos made some memorable remarks:\n\n\"... Private schools are where the greatest and most successful innovations may flourish: loosely supervised by the State and complying with broad State guidelines, private schools enjoy the freedom which public schools lack and, therefore, may achieve great progress. This is the kind of progress we expect Athens College to achieve. This is my judgment of the significance of the College.\"\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Michael Dertouzos]] (1954), former director of the [[M.I.T.]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]], and chairman of the Athens College Board of Trustees.\n* [[Costis Maglaras]] (1987), dean of [[Columbia Business School]].\n* [[Alexander Nehamas]] (1964), academic, professor of Humanities, Philosophy and Comparative Literature at [[Princeton University]].\n* [[Nikiforos Diamandouros]] (1961), academic, [[European Ombudsman]] (2003\u20132013).\n*[[Stavros Dimas]], Vice President of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party and a former Foreign Minister of Greece from 2011\u20132012.

Its members were Epaminondas Charilaos, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, [[Bert Hodge Hill]], Director of the [[American School of Classical Studies]], [[Stephanos Delta]], retired businessman and treasurer of the [[Refugee Settlement Commission]], [[Stavros Papadakis]], [[YMCA]]. secretary, Emmanuel Benakis, retired businessman, former Minister and former Mayor of Athens, Petros Calligas, former Minister, Harold Jacquith, Director of the Near East Relief, Nicolas Kyriakides, shipowner. Later, Emmanuel Benakis who has been a major donator for the College, was named emeritus member and was replaced at the Committee by his son Antonios.\n\nThe institution has been officially recognized with the title \"Hellenic-American Educational Foundation\". The courses began in October 1925 with 15 pupils (it was a school for boys). A building was rented at Androu Street for $215 per month, and Emmanuel Benakis and Stephanos Delta covered the first expenses (\u00a32000). The first Headmaster of the College was the Englishman F. Stroud Read. The American Homer Davis, former teacher at Robert College of Constantinople, had in charge the English Department. Stephanos Delta provided for some years the needed funds for the operation of the School.\n\nIn 1926 the Greek-American Evripides Kehayas, president of [[Standard Commercial Tobacco Co]]., offered $100,000 to the College. In January 1927, a \"Board of Trustees of Athens College in Greece\" was founded at New York. The same year, Emmanuel Benakis offered to the College another $100,000 to buy land at Psychico, suburbs of Athens. Later, Benakis and Delta offered a huge supplement of $500,000. Other Greek personalities, as [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], provided more funds. A new building began to be constructed in March 1927.\nAthens College begun its operation at the new building, called Benaki Hall, in autumn 1928, with 270 pupils, 91 being boarders. President of the College from 1927 was Dr. Henry Dewing. The official opening of Benaki Hall and of the Kehayas aisle took place in May 1929. In June of the same year, graduated the first five pupils.\n\nDuring the academic year 1930\u201331, the number of the pupils reached 351, and the number of professors 44 (9 were Americans, the rest of them Greek). A seventh year was then added to the six-year Gymnasium. This supplementary year will be a particularity of Athens College.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the College had many economic difficulties, and new collects were then organized. With money from various sponsors, new buildings have been constructed, the library has been founded as well a scholarship fund.\nHomer Davis, who was Acting Director of the College after the departure of Dewing in 1930, was named its President in 1932. He will keep this charge until 1960, and will be Acting President in 1964\u201365. The Greek co-directors during those years, were Michael Michaelides-Nouaros (1925\u201327), Demetrius Georgakis (1927\u201336), Emmanuel Troulinos (1936\u201362), Constantine Lalopoulos (1962\u201373) and Sofocles Markianos (1973\u201378).\n\nThe first school-laboratories have been organized in Athens College during the 1930s, by professor of physics Panos Mavromatis. Four rooms have been provided for laboratories of physics, of chemistry, of biology and of geology. The experimental teaching has been from then a main educational policy of the College. From Athens College graduated many eminent Greek scientists, artists and politicians. This College has been an institution preparing Greek students to enter English and U.S. universities.\n\nIn 1974, after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], Athens College accepted 30 [[Greek Cypriot]] refugees into the College Boarding Department and gave them full scholarships.<ref>[http://www.cypriotdaily.com/19741711/archives/Athens-College-Bulletin_Volume-17-Number-1-Winter_1974.pdf Athens College Bulletin]. \"Cypriot Refugee Scholarship Program\" pg. 19</ref>\n\n==Athens College, 1980\u2013today==\n\nAthens College (and its sister school, Psychico College, founded in 1980) is owned by the Hellenic-American Educational Foundation, a non-profit organization with facilities located in Psychico (Middle and High Schools and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program) and Kantza in eastern Attica (two elementary schools: Bodossakio and Latsio).\n\nWhen it first began, in October 1925, Athens College occupied a rented building on 18 Androu Street in the heart of Athens. The school moved to Psychico in 1929. That same year, the Benaki Hall was dedicated by Eleftherios Venizelos, then Greece\u2019s Prime Minister and an ardent supporter of the school. In his speech during the dedication ceremony, Venizelos made some memorable remarks:\n\n\"... Private schools are where the greatest and most successful innovations may flourish: loosely supervised by the State and complying with broad State guidelines, private schools enjoy the freedom which public schools lack and, therefore, may achieve great progress. This is the kind of progress we expect Athens College to achieve. This is my judgment of the significance of the College.\"\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Michael Dertouzos]] (1954), former director of the [[M.I.T.]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]], and chairman of the Athens College Board of Trustees.\n* [[Alexander Nehamas]] (1964), academic, professor of Humanities, Philosophy and Comparative Literature at [[Princeton University]].\n* [[Nikiforos Diamandouros]] (1961), academic, [[European Ombudsman]] (2003\u20132013).\n*[[Stavros Dimas]], Vice President of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party and a former Foreign Minister of Greece from 2011\u20132012.

Among those is the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]], co-founded by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[European Commission]]. Since 2017 it has tried to produce a platform approach for dealing with emerging epidemic disease such as Covid-19, which would enable rapid vaccine development and immunity research in response to outbreaks.<ref name=wsj-prep>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/preparing-for-the-next-pandemic-11585936915 \"Preparing for the Next Pandemic\"], ''Wall Street Journal'', April 3, 2020</ref><ref>Gates, Bill.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info/> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt that the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The CEO of [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] in Boston, saw the problem:\n{{quote|Anybody with eyes in their head, anybody who is watching what is happening in New York and Washington and elsewhere would be foolish not to get ready now.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI/> \n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\". Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the HHS.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref> ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Centralized biodefense strategy===\n\nCiting lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], President Trump released a [[National Biodefense Strategy]] on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Statement from the President on the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security Presidential Memorandum |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-national-biodefense-strategy-national-security-presidential-memorandum/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |last1=Brokaw |first1=Sommer |title=Trump signs presidential memo on national biodefense |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/18/Trump-signs-presidential-memo-on-national-biodefense/2071537290820/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/4c21af485a7d4ccebb22f7316b55d014/White-House-sets-'new-direction'-in-biodefense-strategy|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|date=September 18, 2018|agency=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BartholomewOmberg>Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, [https://thebulletin.org/2019/01/making-sense-of-the-2018-national-biodefense-strategy/ Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (January 18, 2019).</ref> According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation's defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.<ref name=\"statement\" /><ref name=\"UPI\" /> Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed the Secretary of HHS [[Alex Azar]] to oversee implementation of the government's new biodefense strategy and directed [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]] to assist in reviewing and improving the nation's biodefenses.<ref name=\"Owermohle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|website=Politico|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Memo\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"statement\" /> At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,<ref name=BartholomewOmberg /> Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Trump administration outlines new biodefense approach |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-rolling-out-new-biodefense-strategy/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=CBS |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and departures===\n\nIn May 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), largely merging the group responsible for global [[health security]] and [[biodefense]] into a bigger group responsible for [[counter-proliferation]] and biodefense.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the majority position, as described by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on \"certain historical kernels\", and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah.\n\n==Kings of Israel and Judah==\n{{Main|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n{{Kings of Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|500px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nAccording to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head.

Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community. They were close to the government, and some served as advisers and tax collectors/finance ministers. \n\nThese families had special rights in Narbonne, Barcelona, the [[Knights Templar]] and Castile. They possessed real estate and received the title \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\" and\u00a0 ''de la Kblriih'' (''De la Cavalleria''). Among the families of the \"Sons of the Free\" are the families of [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|ibn Ezra]],<!--intentional link to DAB page--> Shaltiel and others.\n\n==Jewish interpretations==\nIn [[Jewish eschatology]], the term ''{{lang|he-Latn|mashiach}}'', or \"[[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]\", came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].<ref name=\"schochet moshiah ben yossef\"/><ref name=\"JVL messiah\"/><ref name=\"JVL The Messiah\">{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/messiah.html | title=The Messiah | publisher=William Morrow and Co | date=1991 | accessdate=2 December 2012 | last=Telushkin | first=Joseph}}</ref> The Messiah is often referred to as \"King Messiah\", or, in Hebrew, {{lang|he|\u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7}} (''{{lang|he-Latn|melekh mashiach}}''), and, in Aramaic, ''malka meshi\u1e25a''.<ref name=\"JVL Flusser\">{{cite web|last=Flusser|first=David|title=Second Temple Period|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=Messiah|publisher=Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] views have generally held that the Messiah will be a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendant of [[David|King David]],<ref>See [[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |title=\"The Real Messiah A Jewish Response to Missionaries\" |accessdate=2012-04-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529164304/http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> and will gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], father a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]], and so on.

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 \"And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile.

Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community. They were close to the government, and some served as advisers and tax collectors/finance ministers. \n\nThese families had special rights in Narbonne, Barcelona, the [[Knights Templar]] and Castile. They possessed real estate and received the title \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\" and\u00a0 ''de la Kblriih'' (''De la Cavalleria''). Among the families of the \"Sons of the Free\" are the families of [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|ibn Ezra]],<!--intentional link to DAB page--> Shaltiel and others.\n\n==Jewish interpretations==\nIn [[Jewish eschatology]], the term ''{{lang|he-Latn|mashiach}}'', or \"[[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]\", came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|king]] from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].<ref name=\"schochet moshiah ben yossef\"/><ref name=\"JVL messiah\"/><ref name=\"JVL The Messiah\">{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/messiah.html | title=The Messiah | publisher=William Morrow and Co | date=1991 | accessdate=2 December 2012 | last=Telushkin | first=Joseph}}</ref> The Messiah is often referred to as \"King Messiah\", or, in Hebrew, {{lang|he|\u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7}} (''{{lang|he-Latn|melekh mashiach}}''), and, in Aramaic, ''malka meshi\u1e25a''.<ref name=\"JVL Flusser\">{{cite web|last=Flusser|first=David|title=Second Temple Period|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=Messiah|publisher=Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] views have generally held that the Messiah will be a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendant of [[David|King David]],<ref>See [[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |title=\"The Real Messiah A Jewish Response to Missionaries\" |accessdate=2012-04-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529164304/http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> and will gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], father a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]], and so on.

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 \"And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile. Because of Jeremiah's curse on Jehoiachin (Coniah) in the early 500s BC (Jer. 22:30), the high priests of Israel, while serving as the ...\"</ref> This same \"curse\" is also considered by some Christian commentators as the reason that [[Zerubbabel]], the rightful Solomonic king during the time of [[Nehemiah]], was not given a kingship under the [[Persian empire]].<ref>Warren W.
