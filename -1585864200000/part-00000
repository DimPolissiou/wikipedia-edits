He met a commercial producer who listened to Charlie's work and thus, Charlie began his career writing [[jingle]]s. His most famous composition is the ''Maple Loops'' song. Charlie then became a successful composer and singer of children's music, with the alias \"Charlie Waffles\", when the jingle business dried up. He can be frequently seen playing the [[Steinway]] [[grand piano]] in his living room. The piano was later removed from the house by Walden Schmidt after his death.\n\nThe character of Charlie Harper is loosely based on Sheen himself.\n\nCharlie prides himself on his [[Playboy (lifestyle)|bachelor/playboy lifestyle]] in [[Malibu, California]]<ref name=\"WBTV1\">{{cite web|title=The ''Two and a Half Men'' Men|url=http://www.warnervideo.com/twoandahalfmen/|publisher=[[Warner Brothers Television]] website|accessdate=May 31, 2008}}</ref> and drives a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], and used to own a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].

Charlie sleeps in constantly, and retains a full-time housekeeper, [[List of Two and a Half Men characters#Cast and characters|Berta]]. Money \"falls into his lap\" as he lives a life of free-spirited debauchery. He has a vast range of phobias including stage fright (unless he is drunk), commitment, his mother, spiders, large birds, germs, change and hard work.\n\nFollowing Sheen's dismissal from the series in March 2011, the character was killed off in the [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|ninth season]], having supposedly been struck by a train while on vacation in [[Paris]]. Charlie's ghost, portrayed by Kathy Bates, returns as a hallucination to Alan, revealing that he is living in Hell trapped in a woman's body. <!--Please note that spoilers are allowed per [[WP:SPOILER]] --> This storyline is later [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively changed]] by the series finale, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]],\" in which his ex-girlfriend Rose reveals that Charlie is, in fact, alive (albeit brainwashed) and has been kept prisoner in the basement of a house that she purchased in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]] after returning to the United States. He escapes from Rose's basement and returns to the beach house. As he rings the doorbell, a piano that is being transported by helicopter falls from the sky, killing him.\n\n==History==\nWhen Charlie's mother Evelyn was pregnant with him (for 7 and a half months), his parents thought that he was going to be a girl, since the [[ultrasound]] showed no signs of a penis.<ref name=\"P1C\">{{cite episode|title=Phase One, Complete |episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Beavers, Susan; Foster, Don|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=November 17, 2003|season=1|number=9}}</ref> According to Evelyn, Charlie was always \"a little drama queen\" when he grew up.<ref name=\"Squab\">{{cite episode|title=Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Beavers, Susan; Foster, Don|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=May 16, 2005|season=2|number=23}}</ref> After his father died of food poisoning, Charlie and his brother [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan]] had three stepdads. The first, Harry Luther Gorsky, left Charlie's and Alan's mother for a young woman (Charlie refers to Harry as \"a little tyrant\"), and Evelyn was also present at his funeral, the second was a twitchy [[gay]] man from [[Texas]] who called him and Alan \"buckaroos\", and the third was \"the Carpet King\", a fat man whom Charlie liked the most because he had \"a grateful daughter\".<ref name=\"ASCTCO\">{{cite episode|title=A Sympathetic Crotch to Cry On|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Gorodetsky, Eddie|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=May 2, 2005|season=2|number=21}}</ref> Well into his 40s, Charlie believed \"the Carpet King\" owned a carpeting business until his mother explained that the man's name was actually sexual slang rather than his profession.\n\nWhen Charlie was young, he was embarrassed by his younger brother Alan, and when Alan had his first school day, Charlie told everyone at school that Alan was his shaved monkey (he later explained he did this because he always wanted a shaved monkey). He also gave his brother full-time [[wedgie]]s and abused him whenever he could. Charlie has dependably had a stressed association with Alan, and would go to all expenses to escape being a decent sibling to him. As a child, Charlie would spook his sibling by giving him wedgies and ridiculing him at school. As a child, Charlie once put a toy in Alan's pocket to shop-lift, and when they got caught, he influenced Alan to assume the fault. Charlie [[Alcohol abuse|drank a lot]] when he was a teenager, was a [[Chain smoking|chain smoker]], and constantly ran away, nevertheless his mother did not mind because he always came back, and generally didn't care about her sons. He once even, when he was 16, drove to [[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] with a school nurse. When he was 17, he almost married a woman whom he thought was the love of his life, but relented; as Charlie says, if he didn't, he would today be married to a \"65-year old retired belly dancer\".<ref name=\"Squab\"/> Charlie constantly criticizes Alan's and Jake's presence in his house, but generally seems comfortable that they are around, because they are the only people who have known him for a long time and remain in his daily life. When Alan was surprised to find Charlie did not have their mother's cell phone number in his contacts list, Charlie told him \"If I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone.\" On a later episode, it is shown Charlie does get his mother's number. In fact, he has it on the speed dial address that he finds appropriate for her, \"[[666 (number)|666]]\".\n\nCharlie and Alan have an estranged relationship with their mother and try to avoid her at all costs; Charlie refers to her as \"a [[Satan]]\". Not much is known about their biological father, Francis Harper, except that when Charlie thinks back he says he was a horrible son to him. Evelyn, even after multiple marriages, still keeps her first husband's name (Harper). Charlie also once had a [[hallucination]] of his father Francis telling him to take care of his mother, which horrified him, but when he saw an old gangster film, he realized that he \"misunderstood\" him, and to actually kill her when he is able to.\n\nCharlie is often uncaring towards Alan. In one episode he made Alan go on a date in spite of being sick with the flu, merely in order to afford him (Charlie) the opportunity to have \"revenge sex\". In another episode when Alan got frustrated in a bookstore and wanted to miss a movie that they were going to see Charlie replied, \"So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]. Don't you think that is a little selfish, Alan?\" Furthermore, after Alan's second divorce Alan tells Charlie that he needs him in front of a crowd of people to which Charlie retorts, \"Anyone know a Charlie?\" He additionally derives enjoyment from rubbing his own success in Alan's face and further complicating Alan's situations just for the fun of it. He is particularly harsh about Alan's situation with Judith, especially since he told Alan not to marry her and tried to bribe him with a $1000 prostitute.\n\nWhile Charlie loves his nephew Jake and, at the beginning of the show, used him to get dates, he often makes jokes revolving around Jake's apparent lack of intellectual ability, and often states that he is destined to be a doorstop or a fry cook, and states that he is not a kid, but a \"gassy dwarf\". Nevertheless, it is often shown that Charlie genuinely loves Jake, and sometimes acts like a father to him, giving him some advice, that Alan is unable to give.\n\nDespite his selfish attitude, Charlie can be caring at times. Though Charlie often scolds Alan for being a \"sponge\", Charlie has continued to provide two out of his three bedrooms to Alan, without rent, and seemingly provides all of his meals, even when the two dine out together. In many occasions, he has stood up to Jake for Alan when Jake started roasting his father. He also cares a lot for Jake, even though he has trouble admitting it. In the episode \"Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats\" Jake gets an injury and Charlie goes out of his way to make sure that he's safe. In the episode \"The Mooch at the Boo\" Jake and his neighbor, a pretty girl named Celeste, disappear together and Celeste's father Jerome (played by [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), an ex-football player, came looking. When they were found kissing, Charlie later said to Jerome that he would take the beating intended for Jake.\n\nCharlie watches a lot of sports on TV, but has little interest in athletics ''per se''; rather, Charlie is a frequent gambler. He watches sports to keep tabs on his investments, and bets on horse races, football matches, etc. Two of his favorite sitcoms are ''[[Dharma and Greg]]'' and ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]''.\n\nDespite his [[upper class]] and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] persona, Charlie can be remarkably [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] about everyday matters. In \"Last Chance to See Those Tattoos,\" Alan observes that Charlie does not really understand how the [[Internet]] works. In \"I Can't Afford Hyenas,\" Charlie is shown to have no understanding of how to care for his own living expenses because he entrusts an accountant with managing his cash flow and paying the bills, but the accountant is actually swindling him. When his accountant is arrested, Charlie is not even aware of a problem until he receives notices from the bank that his accounts are delinquent, his credit cards are maxed out and his car is in danger of being repossessed. He has never done his own laundry, and has no idea how a washing machine works; he believes Alan when he sarcastically says that the machine will call him when the cycle is complete.<ref>Episode 4.10 \"Kissing Abraham Lincoln\"</ref> In the final few months of his life after Chelsea left him, he reverts to his old ways: drinking excessively, gambling, smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] to help him sleep and partying hard for hours. This began to affect him psychologically and physically; he aged considerably, gave himself a bad haircut, broke several toes and received a black eye from one of his adventures in Las Vegas. He eventually admits that his behavior is a way to cope with depression and loneliness.\n\nHe is the only other character besides Alan to appear in every episode until his killing off.\n\n==Reported death==\nCharlie Harper was reported by Rose to have died in [[Paris]] after being struck by a train. The [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|season 9]] premiere featured his funeral with one of Charlie's trademark bowling shirts and a pair of cargo shorts hanging by his closed casket. Rose explained that he had proposed to her in Paris and the next few days had been happy, but when she returned from shopping one day, she found him showering with another woman. The next day he fell off a [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] platform and was struck by a train, his body exploding \"like a balloon full of meat\". It is implied by Rose and suggested by Berta that Rose was responsible for Charlie's death.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 9)#ep178|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=September 19, 2011|season=9|number=1|minutes=02:40}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Alan and Charlie's ghost.jpg|upright|thumb|Charlie's ghost (as portrayed by [[Kathy Bates]])]]\nFollowing his death, Charlie has been frequently mentioned by his surviving (though very few) loved ones. It tends to be in a disrespectful manner and secrets and previously unknown details about his life emerge.\n\nAfter his funeral his ashes are delivered and Alan decides to spread them on the beach but spills them after being scared at seeing [[Walden Schmidt]] at the window, soaking wet. In \"Those Fancy Japanese Toilets\", Charlie is shown to have kept a private journal. He kept it in a safe deposit box at the bank, and after he died, the bank contacted his mother about it. She gives the journal to Alan, who becomes fascinated with it, as the entries give an insight to a whole new side of Charlie that he never saw before. It is revealed that Charlie had postulated about the various causes of his death, including liver failure and being pushed in front of a bus, and that he questioned his condescending behavior towards women. It's revealed that when Charlie first met his nephew Jake, he believed that he was to have a bright future ahead of him, but secretly thought he was not Alan's biological son (implied by him to Alan years prior). It is also hinted that, despite all the criticism and abuse, he actually idolized his brother and missed him when he moved in with Lyndsey, however he knew at the same time that he would be back \"before long\".\n\nIn \"Thank You for the Intercourse\", Walden redecorates the house and therefore donates Charlie's piano to an orphanage. Alan suffers a mental breakdown, after realizing how much he misses Charlie and starts to act like him because of it, even picking up women with much success. Jake and Walden are worried about Alan's strange behavior and Walden then brings Alan to a mental institution after tricking him into believing that they were going for a trip to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and that he stayed at the [[Bellagio (resort and casino)|Bellagio]] penthouse suite.\n\nCharlie is re-introduced into the series in the episode \"Why We Gave Up Women\", portrayed by [[Kathy Bates]]. While Alan is hospitalized for a mild heart attack, he awakens to find a strange woman sitting at the foot of his bed, dressed like Charlie and smoking a cigar. She also introduces herself as Charlie. Still not convinced, Alan asks her questions that only the real Charlie could answer, and she does so correctly. Charlie proceeds to explain that he ended up in [[Hell]], and, as part of his punishment, must live eternity in the body of a large, older woman, albeit with a pair of testicles (he does not consider his new form all bad, as he is able to grope his own breasts). Charlie advises Alan to turn his life around and become self-dependent for once. After the meeting, Alan decides to rent an apartment, which is very low-grade. The following night, Charlie reappears to Alan, and admits that he did not care if Alan changed, but was happy that even though he is dead, he was finally able to get him out of his house. Later, after Alan fakes a second heart attack, in the hospital, Charlie appears to Jake, trying to hint who he is after addressing him by his old pet name \"Tater Head\", but Jake fails to understand. Annoyed, Charlie goes back to Hell, escorted by two sexy women, where he wistfully complains about not having a penis any more.\n\nAccording to [[Chuck Lorre]], the show's producers were so impressed with Bates performance, that they were considering bringing her back in the recurring role of \"Alan's demonic [[spirit guide]]\".<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Bates-Charlie-1046063.aspx TV Guide website]</ref> Bates did not return to the show after this appearance.\n\nCharlie is mentioned briefly in the season 10 episode \"A Big Bag of Dog\", when Walden has an emotional breakdown upstairs in the master bedroom over a breakup, Berta says that Charlie used to have emotional meltdowns over breakups in that bedroom, too. He is mentioned in the season 10 episode \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\" when Rose returns, Alan asks Walden if she told him that she was stalking his brother, and again when Rose is unsure whether to date Walden as he lives in Charlie's house, but Walden insists that has nothing to do with Alan or himself. He is referenced to by Walden in \"Something My Gynecologist Said\" when he is talking about this fake book he is writing, about a man called Alan who lives with his brother in a beach house, but the brother dies by being pushed in front of a train, and a billionaire comes and buys the house. Berta mentions him in \"I Scream When I Pee\", when saying that she didn't think she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but says that Walden is the greatest boss she ever had, after he comes to cheer her up on her birthday and buys her a car. Alan briefly mentions him in \"Advantage: Fat, Flying Baby\". He is mentioned again in the season 10 finale, \"Cows, Prepare to Be Tipped\", when Alan reveals that Charlie left Jake two of his last cigars for when Jake graduates college. Alan and Jake smoke them and laugh heartily. In \"Big Episode. Someone Stole a Spoon\", after a wild party at the beach house leaves an intense mess with wreckage, Walden come out into the living room and says, \"It looks like Charlie Sheen's house!\", referencing not the character, but the actor himself.\n\n===Daughter===\nIn season 11, a woman knocks on Walden and Alan's door, and introduces herself as Jenny, Charlie's daughter, which surprises Alan to the point of shock, as he never knew that he had a daughter, but amuses Walden. According to Jenny, the last time she saw him alive was at her fourth birthday. Hurt because Charlie didn't want to marry her, Jenny's mother banned him from ever seeing Jenny again. Wanting to somehow provide for Jenny, Charlie would send a lucrative check to the family every month up until his passing. Alan reveals to Jenny that he kept his brother's ashes and put them in the liquor cabinet. He spills his ashes twice in the same day but is happy when he finds two quarters in them. It is also the first time Walden mentions Charlie by name, after previously only referring to him as \"your brother\" or \"Alan's brother\", and he wishes there was something other than Alan that Charlie would have left behind. Berta begins to tell Jenny stories of Charlie's life but Walden stops her and asks if she has any stories for Jenny that don't include drugs, alcohol or hookers, Berta is unable to recall any more stories than ones that include those things. Later at Pavlov's, Jenny, Walden, Alan and Evelyn toast to Charlie as a father, brother, son and guy who bought his beach house after got hit by a train\n\nIn the second episode Evelyn says to her boyfriend that she wasn't the greatest mother to Charlie and Alan, and that she wants to make up for it with Jenny. She asks Jenny if she wants to see pictures of her father at the police station as they will have more pictures of him than she ever took. Walden talks to Charlie's ashes for the first time in season 11, asking him for a sign of advice on what to do about his love life and thanks him for the house, stating, \"you'd have to be on crack to give all this up\". Jenny claims that in her entire life, Charlie only wrote to her once asking \"Are your friends 18 yet?\"\n\n===Return===\nIn the [[series finale]], \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\", a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] reveals that Charlie is not dead but survived an attempt on his life by an angry Rose after she found him having sex with a hooker, a mime, and a goat on their honeymoon. Rose binds and gags him and returns Charlie to the United States where she brainwashes him and confines him to a pit under her house in Sherman Oaks. He escapes after four years, collects $2.5 million in royalty money, and sends messages to Alan, Evelyn, and Walden, warning of his imminent return and threatening revenge against them. He also sends Jenny, his former girlfriends, Berta, and Jake generous checks. In the last moments of the finale, Charlie is seen walking (only shown from the back) to the door of his beach house, when a helicopter is transporting Charlie's grand piano and just as he is about to ring the doorbell of the beach house, the piano drops and Charlie disappears once and for all. No one was particularly happy that Charlie was alive because he was planning to kill them, and because the characters had moved on with their lives and become a closer family unit than they had been when Charlie was alive and lived there.\n\nDespite speculation that Charlie Sheen would make a cameo appearance, he does not appear in the program. Instead, his character is depicted via animation as a re-enactment of events when Rose is explaining what happened in Paris and by a stand-in in the last scene which only shows Charlie from behind.\n\nAccording to showrunner [[Chuck Lorre]], writing in the [[vanity card]] that appeared at the end of the episode, Sheen was offered a role in the finale where he would have \"walk[ed] to the front door in the last scene, ring the doorbell, then turn, look directly into the camera and go off on a maniacal rant about the dangers of drug abuse. He would then explain that these dangers only applied to average people. That he was far from average. He was a ninja warrior from Mars. He was invincible. And then we would drop a piano on him. We thought it was funny. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he wanted us to write a heart warming scene that would set up his return to primetime TV in a new sitcom called ''The Harpers'' starring him and Jon Cryer. We thought that was funny too.\"\n\n==Love life==\nCharlie's love life is a recurring theme in his character. He is an alcoholic [[Womanizing|womanizer]] who has engaged in decades of frequent [[one-night stand]]s, [[prostitute]]s, [[casual sex]], and \"relationships\" of short duration, in stark contrast to his brother Alan's inability to garner much female attention. Even though Charlie usually never calls any of his partners again after he had sex with them, there are a few relationships on the show that lasted longer than one night, notably his neighbor Rose, who continues to stalk him after they spent one night together, and Jake's [[ballet]] teacher Mia, whom Charlie was actually in love with, and almost married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He usually dated much younger women, but starting in season 5, he pursued relationships that were a change of pace for him. He started a relationship with a respected judge played by [[Ming-Na]] and later with a substantially older single mother/author ([[Susan Blakely]]), but he later blew it with both women. In season 6, Charlie proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]], who has also played three other roles in earlier seasons) just to get her to return his love for her. But eventually turns out that it was the only love of his life when he dumped Mia and confessed his love for Chelsea. They remain engaged throughout season 7 until Charlie throws up on a baby, forcing Chelsea to dump him and leaving Charlie heartbroken. At the end of season 8 he goes off with Rose to a romantic getaway in Paris, which ultimately resulted in his 'death'.\n\n==Notable love interests (in order of appearance)==\n\n===Rose===\nCharlie and Rose ([[Melanie Lynskey]]) spent [[one-night stand|one night together]] shortly before the events portrayed in the show; after this, Rose became increasingly obsessed with him. She usually spends time at his beach house when Charlie and Alan are gone, and when they come back they usually find a surprise, such as cabinets that are glued shut. Rose demonstrates her obsession with Charlie in numerous ways: when taking up with Charlie's pizza boy Gordon, she flaunted him to Charlie in an obvious but useless attempt to make the latter jealous; she then attempted to mold Gordon into Charlie by dressing him in short pants and designer bowling shirts like those Charlie usually wears, and instructing him to try to emulate Charlie's poses; she has named all of her five ferrets Charlie.<ref name=\"TSUMS\">{{cite episode|title=The Salmon Under My Sweater|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Foster, Don|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=November 10, 2004|season=2|number=10}}</ref> Rose's father (portrayed by Sheen's real-life father [[Martin Sheen|Martin]]) became similarly obsessed with Charlie's mother Evelyn; Charlie and Evelyn sought \"expert\" assistance (i.e., Rose) to get rid of him. Charlie is usually charmed by Rose, but is not interested in a relationship with her, even though Berta thinks they are a good couple together. When Rose decided to leave to go to [[London, England|London]] Charlie believed that she was only pretending in order to get him into a relationship with her; after she really left, Charlie realized that he made a horrible mistake by letting Rose go.<ref name=\"MDS\">{{cite episode|title=My Damn Stalker|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Gorodetsky, Eddie|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=February 12, 2007|season=4|number=15}}</ref> He then went to London to meet her but quickly returned home when Rose started talking about his moving there and starting a family together. Rose has since returned to Malibu and continues to stalk Charlie. As of \"The Devil's Lube,\" there is a chance of a future relationship between the two; in this episode Charlie points out that he has not seen Rose in a while, but she cannot say the same. In \"Above Exalted Cyclops,\" Rose, after being set up by Chelsea, now has moved on from Charlie and is stalking Alan, or possibly stalking both brothers. In \"Gumby with a Pokey\" (her only appearance in Season 7), she is still noted as Charlie's stalker, implying that she is either done stalking Alan and back to Charlie, or stalking both brothers. Gordon is unaware of Rose's brief relationship with Alan.<ref>When Charlie introduces Gordon to Alan's ex-wife's new husband Herb and Alan's girlfriend's ex-husband Chris in ep. 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\" Gordon claims that he has not had sex with anyone in Alan's life.</ref> In Season 8's \"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\" Rose is again stalking Charlie. This time it has become too much for Charlie's new girlfriend Michelle, who is convinced that Charlie loves Rose. Rose tells Charlie that she is marrying a guy named \"Manfred Quinn,\" which appears to be verified when Charlie and Alan go to the church and peer through a door window to see a wedding in progress. The two walk away, with Charlie confused and apparently heartbroken. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that, with the exception of the priest and Rose, all the other attendants are [[mannequin]]s (hence the name of Rose's purported groom: Manfred \"Manny\" Quinn). Later in Season 8, Charlie tells Rose that he loves her and they begin a romantic relationship with Charlie even taking her on a romantic getaway to Paris despite the fact that he still thinks she is truly married. It is implied that Rose has something to do with Charlie's death in Paris after it is revealed she caught him having an affair. Charlie had proposed to her in Paris also which was mentioned by Rose at Charlie's funeral and Rose said yes to the proposal. In \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\", Rose begins a relationship with Walden, and after \"Ferrets, Attack!\" begins stalking him and ruining his life.\n\n===Jill/Bill===\nBill ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) was a previous girlfriend of Charlie's appearing in a season one episode, \"An Old Flame with a New Wick\". Bill had since had sexual-reassignment surgery and was formerly living as ''Jill''. Charlie comments during the episode that while the relationship was passionate, sex with Bill was \"a little weird\". As the episode progresses, Bill begins dating Charlie's mother Evelyn (she is initially unaware of Bill's history). Once Bill's identity is revealed to her, she faints, but decides to continue seeing Bill. Bill was never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Lisa===\nLisa ([[Denise Richards]]) was Charlie's favorite ex-girlfriend. She appeared in one season 1 and one season 2 episode. In \"Merry Thanksgiving,\" Charlie proposed to her but she decided to marry another man. In \"Yes, Monsignor,\" Charlie had to prove that he is good with babies when he found out she had one (played by Richards' and Sheen's real-life first daughter Sam). Notably, she was absent at Charlie's funeral.\n\n===Delores Pasternak===\nMiss Delores Pasternak ([[Missi Pyle]], also [[Alicia Witt]] in season 6) was Jake's fifth-grade teacher. Charlie charmed her to save Jake from suspension for flipping her off, but she proved to be a domineering/school-marm type, driving Charlie to break up with her, after which she had a meltdown that got her fired from teaching and disowned by her family, leaving her to become a bikini dancer. After running into each other four years later (see \"A Jock Strap in Hell\"), Charlie feels guilty about this and hires her as Jake's private tutor, leading them to resume their romantic relationship. She quickly reverts to her religious self and Charlie breaks up with her again. She was seen at Charlie's funeral, where she mentioned he made tea using her panties.\n\n===Isabella===\nIsabella ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]) was Charlie's Goth girlfriend known to bring a dark atmosphere with her. She and several of her girlfriends \"anoint\" Charlie as their king in a ceremony, \"bonding\" them for life. It's revealed that she knows Evelyn from [[Pilates]] class, and Isabella was unaware that Charlie and Alan are Evelyn's sons. Isabella was at Charlie's funeral, where she mentions that Charlie gave her [[Herpes simplex|herpes]].\n\n===Kandi===\nCharlie had a brief relationship with Kandi ([[April Bowlby]], credited as \"Kymber\"), after which she married his brother, [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan]]. Kandi is depicted as hot and young (half the age of Alan or Charlie), with a \"[[dumb blonde]]\" stereotype, even though she is a redhead.\n\n===Mia===\nMia ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]) is a ballet teacher, whom Charlie had a crush on, and was engaged to for a short while. Charlie decided not to marry Mia after she insisted that Alan and Jake must move out of the house, only to find out that Alan had married [[Kandi (Two and a Half Men)|Kandi]] and moved out. Charlie later became sexually reckless and depressed, because he learned that Mia was going to marry someone else. Charlie blamed Alan for ruining everything, but later realizes that he was just looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. They reunited in person at the end of season 6's \"Baseball Was Better With Steroids,\" resulting in a cliffhanger for the season finale. In season 7's premiere \"818-jklpuzo\", Mia appears in much less favorable light. Mia asks Charlie for help with a singing career, but in reality she appears to want him back. By this time, Charlie had begun a relationship with Chelsea, and is now torn between the two. While in the studio recording a demo tape, Mia asks Charlie for sex after revealing that she is a horrible singer. Charlie tells Mia she cannot sing, and chooses Chelsea. As Charlie rushes away he turns off Mia's microphone, so that he cannot hear her yell and swear at him. Mia was at Charlie's funeral, demanding to see the body.\n\n===Lydia===\nShortly after he cancelled his wedding with Mia, Charlie began dating a rude real-estate agent named Lydia ([[Katherine LaNasa]]). Alan, Jake, Rose and Berta did not like her and made this clear to Charlie, but when she met his mother, Evelyn, the four realised that she and Evelyn were exactly alike in character. Bobby, the waiter at Charlie's and Evelyn's favorite restaurant, was the first to recognise Lydia's similarity to Evelyn. When Lydia began bossing Berta around, Berta threatened to quit unless Charlie broke up with her. Lydia meanwhile threatened to break up with Charlie unless he fired Berta. In the end, Charlie broke up with Lydia, and Berta would only return if Charlie admitted his [[sexual addiction]] and attended rehab. At Charlie's funeral, Lydia mentions that Charlie loved being spanked.\n\n===Myra===\nMyra ([[Judy Greer]]) is the sister of Herb Melnick (Judith's husband after Alan). She bonded with Charlie over their hatred of Judith. Judith did not want the two dating, and would take her frustration out on Alan. Judith did not want Charlie coming over to her house either, so Charlie invited Myra to his house. Even though she was supposed to be sleeping in Jake's room, Myra slept with Charlie, leaving Alan and Jake to hear them and find out the truth. When Charlie wanted to pursue the relationship, he was heartbroken to learn that she was engaged and he'd have to drive her to the airport after the wedding, and that he'd never see her again. Greer again appears in Season 9 as Walden's ex-wife.\n\n===Linda Harris===\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, Charlie dated Judge Linda Harris ([[Ming-Na]]), a judge of his own age. Their relationship ended in the middle of the same season, after Linda concluded that she couldn't \"be connected publicly to a guy like [Charlie]\" after he publicly humiliated her (under the influence of his mother's \"medication\") at an event held in her honor. The random songs which Charlie sang to her son Brandon while babysitting, essentially launched his show-biz persona, \"Charlie Waffles\".\n\n===Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman===\nCharlie also fell for his future stepsister, \"Courtney\" ([[Jenny McCarthy]]) in Season 5, and after agreeing to stop seeing her due to their relationship to each other, he lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes moments before they become step-siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart-broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia, but he apparently retains feelings for her, telling her that he will \"wait\" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's \"Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\" (as Courtney) after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her.<ref>\"Two and a Half Men Review: Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\". Article at TVFanatic.com [http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/11/two-and-a-half-men-review-ow-ow-dont-stop/ TV Fanatic]</ref> Courtney and Charlie break up two episodes later in \"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead\" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. Although surprisingly she holds a lot of resentment towards him at his funeral in the season 9 opener. In the season 9 episode \"Nine Magic Fingers\", Courtney starts dating [[Walden Schmidt]] ([[Ashton Kutcher]]), but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget, Walden's wife, successfully convince Walden that Courtney is simply a con artist.\n\n===Angie===\nNear the end of season 5, Charlie met an older woman ([[Susan Blakely]]) named Angie who was also the author of a relationship self-help book that he was interested in reading. Angie has been described as a mother figure to Charlie, more so than even his own mother, Evelyn. When Angie introduced him to her grown son Jeremy and his fianc\u00e9e Tricia (Virginia Williams), Charlie realized that he had dated Tricia earlier in his life. After Tricia revealed that she still had feelings for Charlie, Tricia dumped Jeremy, and Angie became, as Alan describes, a \"mean drunk\" who verbally lashed out at Charlie and furiously broke up with him.\n\n===Melissa===\nIn a season 6 episode (\"The Flavin' and the Mavin'\"), Charlie is annoyed that he has to drive Alan to work, until he meets Alan's spunky young receptionist, Melissa ([[Kelly Stables]]). Alan begs Charlie not to hit on her, as it will likely end badly and complicate their working relationship, but Charlie ignores him. Charlie sleeps with Melissa, then becomes annoyed when she constantly hangs around his house. Melissa becomes vindictive when she realizes that Charlie is not serious about their relationship. As Alan suspected, the failed relationship causes Melissa to demand a raise and health insurance. (Melissa would later date Alan in several episodes of seasons 6, 7 and 8, becoming the third of Charlie's ex-girlfriends to later date Alan.)\n\n===Chelsea===\nChelsea Christine Melini ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]]) starts dating Charlie in season 6, and is the first woman to whom he confessed his love without prompting. He says this nearly by accident, but claims he meant it. At first, Chelsea was another one of Charlie's one-night stands, but it soon evolved into a relationship. The relationship comes to a rut with Chelsea wanting to break up, but after some couples counseling, the two remained together. Charlie proposed to her, ring and all, just to get her to say \"I love you\" back to him, and until the middle of season 7, they were engaged to be married. When Chelsea moved into the Harper beach house, Charlie rented out her vacant apartment to get alone time. Chelsea has a cat named \"Sir Lancelot\", who was almost never seen on-camera (two exceptions are in \"Mmm, fish. Yum.\" and \"Tinkle Like a Princess\") and was constantly being stepped on, mostly by Charlie, but once by Alan. Chelsea got along well with Evelyn, much to Charlie's chagrin, and had a very rocky relationship with her nephew-to-be Jake, until Charlie forced them to work out their issues. Charlie had a telephone video of one of their lovemaking events, but when Chelsea found out, she erased the video herself. The two eventually broke up due to Charlie's jealousy towards her friendship with Alan's lawyer, Brad. Charlie then made matters worse by vomiting on a baby in public while apologizing to her, and subsequently slept with Chelsea's best friend, Gail ([[Tricia Helfer]]). Chelsea's last appearance was in the first episode of Season 9, when she announced at Charlie's funeral that he gave her [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]; Gail, who also attended, said Charlie gave ''her'' vaginal warts.\n\n===Betsy===\nBetsy ([[Katy Mixon]]) first met the Harper brothers the day Charlie and Chelsea set the date for their wedding. Panicked over the impending end of his bachelor lifestyle, Charlie finds himself blacked out drunk in bed with Betsy and Alan shortly after their meeting in Pavlov's Bar. With little memory of the night's events, Alan and Charlie left her home before dawn. Only remembering flashes of himself, his brother, and Betsy fooling around naked, shortly after Alan performed a striptease in drag, Charlie went to his mother for advice. To help wipe the disturbing memories from Charlie's mind, Evelyn told him of the time she cheated on her third husband with circus folk, including a clown, strongman, bearded lady, acrobats, and dwarfs, in one debased night. Traumatized by Evelyn's story, Charlie's few memories of the night were now replaced with images of his mother's circus orgy. When Charlie and Betsy encounter each other again, they immediately run off to Las Vegas and have a \"quickie\" wedding. But the marriage is soon rendered invalid when it is revealed that Betsy is already married.\n\n===Michelle===\nMichelle ([[Liz Vassey]]) is Charlie's dermatologist. In \"Twanging Your Magic Clanger,\" they met when Charlie was getting a mole removed from his behind. They went to a movie and Charlie was surprised to learn that she is older than he is. After Alan telling him that he's probably gonna be dead for ten years by the time she turns 70 (which ironically came true, as he died not too long after), he went to Michelle and told her that he was interested in being in a relationship with her. He then met Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, which led him to briefly think about sex with the daughter. But after finding out that she thinks \"older guys\" (much younger than Charlie) are bad to have sex with, he returns to Michelle. In \"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\" Michelle and Charlie went on a date where they had lunch with Evelyn and Alan, causing a few embarrassing details about Charlie's past to slip out. When they got to Charlie's house, Charlie introduced Michelle to Berta and told Michelle about his past girlfriends and other sordid details of his life. To Charlie's surprise, Michelle still wanted to be with him. Later that night, Charlie's neighbor/stalker Rose appeared on his deck. Michelle was upset with Charlie, because he did not mention Rose in any of his confessions. Nor did he mention the fact that she constantly stalked him. The next week, Charlie went to Michelle's house with flowers and begged her to give him another chance. Michelle broke up with Charlie anyway, convinced that he still had feelings for Rose. At Charlie's funeral, Michelle builds on Lydia's remark about him by adding that he liked being spanked while wearing Michelle's panties.\n\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Two_and_a_Half_Men#Charlie|Charlie Harper}}\n* [http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/11290/TV/Charlie+Harpers+Girlfriends+from+Two++a+Half+Men.aspx Small list of Charlie's famous girlfriends]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090222124844/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/01/networkproven_names_pull_in_sy.php TV week article]\n* Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Subjects, Themes and Settings (McFarland & Co., 2007), {{ISBN|0-7864-2498-2}}, 978-0-7864-2498-6, found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7NkAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Charlie+Harper%22+%2B+%22Two+and+a+Half+Men%22&dq=%22Charlie+Harper%22+%2B+%22Two+and+a+Half+Men%22&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Google Books from the University of Michigan]\n* [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/02/10/2009-02-10_wingman_lands_a_little_off_target-1.html Daily News article]\n* [http://eventful.com/woodlandhills/events/its-curtains-charlie-harper-free-comedy-even-/E0-001-041720966-0 Comedic \"Funeral\" Event for Charlie held on September 18, 2011]\n* John Kenneth Muir, TV Year: The Prime Time 2005\u20132006 Season (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007)\n{{ISBN|1-55783-684-1}}, 978-1-55783-684-7\n* Stephen F.

He met a commercial producer who listened to Charlie's work and thus, Charlie began his career writing [[jingle]]s. His most famous composition is the ''Maple Loops'' song. Charlie then became a successful composer and singer of children's music, with the alias \"Charlie Waffles\", when the jingle business dried up. He can be frequently seen playing the [[Steinway]] [[grand piano]] in his living room. The piano was later removed from the house by Walden Schmidt after his death.\n\nThe character of Charlie Harper is loosely based on Sheen himself.\n\nCharlie prides himself on his [[Playboy (lifestyle)|bachelor/playboy lifestyle]] in [[Malibu, California]]<ref name=\"WBTV1\">{{cite web|title=The ''Two and a Half Men'' Men|url=http://www.warnervideo.com/twoandahalfmen/|publisher=[[Warner Brothers Television]] website|accessdate=May 31, 2008}}</ref> and drives a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], and used to own a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].

Charlie sleeps in constantly, and retains a full-time housekeeper, [[List of Two and a Half Men characters#Cast and characters|Berta]]. Money \"falls into his lap\" as he lives a life of free-spirited debauchery. He has a vast range of phobias including stage fright (unless he is drunk), commitment, his mother, spiders, large birds, germs, change and hard work.\n\nFollowing Sheen's dismissal from the series in March 2011, the character was killed off in the [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|ninth season]], having supposedly been struck by a train while on vacation in [[Paris]]. Charlie's ghost, portrayed by Kathy Bates, returns as a hallucination to Alan, revealing that he is living in Hell trapped in a woman's body. <!--Please note that spoilers are allowed per [[WP:SPOILER]] --> This storyline is later [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively changed]] by the series finale, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]],\" in which his ex-girlfriend Rose reveals that Charlie is, in fact, alive (albeit brainwashed) and has been kept prisoner in the basement of a house that she purchased in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]] after returning to the United States. He escapes from Rose's basement and returns to the beach house. As he rings the doorbell, a piano that is being transported by helicopter falls from the sky, killing him.\n\n==History==\nWhen Charlie's mother Evelyn was pregnant with him (for 7 and a half months), his parents thought that he was going to be a girl, since the [[ultrasound]] showed no signs of a penis.<ref name=\"P1C\">{{cite episode|title=Phase One, Complete |episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Beavers, Susan; Foster, Don|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=November 17, 2003|season=1|number=9}}</ref> According to Evelyn, Charlie was always \"a little drama queen\" when he grew up.<ref name=\"Squab\">{{cite episode|title=Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab, Squab|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Beavers, Susan; Foster, Don|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=May 16, 2005|season=2|number=23}}</ref> After his father died of food poisoning, Charlie and his brother [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan]] had three stepdads. The first, Harry Luther Gorsky, left Charlie's and Alan's mother for a young woman (Charlie refers to Harry as \"a little tyrant\"), and Evelyn was also present at his funeral, the second was a twitchy [[gay]] man from [[Texas]] who called him and Alan \"buckaroos\", and the third was \"the Carpet King\", a fat man whom Charlie liked the most because he had \"a grateful daughter\".<ref name=\"ASCTCO\">{{cite episode|title=A Sympathetic Crotch to Cry On|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Gorodetsky, Eddie|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=May 2, 2005|season=2|number=21}}</ref> Well into his 40s, Charlie believed \"the Carpet King\" owned a carpeting business until his mother explained that the man's name was actually sexual slang rather than his profession.\n\nWhen Charlie was young, he was embarrassed by his younger brother Alan, and when Alan had his first school day, Charlie told everyone at school that Alan was his shaved monkey (he later explained he did this because he always wanted a shaved monkey). He also gave his brother full-time [[wedgie]]s and abused him whenever he could. Charlie has dependably had a stressed association with Alan, and would go to all expenses to escape being a decent sibling to him. As a child, Charlie would spook his sibling by giving him wedgies and ridiculing him at school. As a child, Charlie once put a toy in Alan's pocket to shop-lift, and when they got caught, he influenced Alan to assume the fault. Charlie [[Alcohol abuse|drank a lot]] when he was a teenager, was a [[Chain smoking|chain smoker]], and constantly ran away, nevertheless his mother did not mind because he always came back, and generally didn't care about her sons. He once even, when he was 16, drove to [[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] with a school nurse. When he was 17, he almost married a woman whom he thought was the love of his life, but relented; as Charlie says, if he didn't, he would today be married to a \"65-year old retired belly dancer\".<ref name=\"Squab\"/> Charlie constantly criticizes Alan's and Jake's presence in his house, but generally seems comfortable that they are around, because they are the only people who have known him for a long time and remain in his daily life. When Alan was surprised to find Charlie did not have their mother's cell phone number in his contacts list, Charlie told him \"If I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone.\" On a later episode, it is shown Charlie does get his mother's number. In fact, he has it on the speed dial address that he finds appropriate for her, \"[[666 (number)|666]]\".\n\nCharlie and Alan have an estranged relationship with their mother and try to avoid her at all costs; Charlie refers to her as \"a [[Satan]]\". Not much is known about their biological father, Francis Harper, except that when Charlie thinks back he says he was a horrible son to him. Evelyn, even after multiple marriages, still keeps her first husband's name (Harper). Charlie also once had a [[hallucination]] of his father Francis telling him to take care of his mother, which horrified him, but when he saw an old gangster film, he realized that he \"misunderstood\" him, and to actually kill her when he is able to.\n\nCharlie is often uncaring towards Alan. In one episode he made Alan go on a date in spite of being sick with the flu, merely in order to afford him (Charlie) the opportunity to have \"revenge sex\". In another episode when Alan got frustrated in a bookstore and wanted to miss a movie that they were going to see Charlie replied, \"So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]. Don't you think that is a little selfish, Alan?\" Furthermore, after Alan's second divorce Alan tells Charlie that he needs him in front of a crowd of people to which Charlie retorts, \"Anyone know a Charlie?\" He additionally derives enjoyment from rubbing his own success in Alan's face and further complicating Alan's situations just for the fun of it. He is particularly harsh about Alan's situation with Judith, especially since he told Alan not to marry her and tried to bribe him with a $1000 prostitute.\n\nWhile Charlie loves his nephew Jake and, at the beginning of the show, used him to get dates, he often makes jokes revolving around Jake's apparent lack of intellectual ability, and often states that he is destined to be a doorstop or a fry cook, and states that he is not a kid, but a \"gassy dwarf\". Nevertheless, it is often shown that Charlie genuinely loves Jake, and sometimes acts like a father to him, giving him some advice, that Alan is unable to give.\n\nDespite his selfish attitude, Charlie can be caring at times. Though Charlie often scolds Alan for being a \"sponge\", Charlie has continued to provide two out of his three bedrooms to Alan, without rent, and seemingly provides all of his meals, even when the two dine out together. In many occasions, he has stood up to Jake for Alan when Jake started roasting his father. He also cares a lot for Jake, even though he has trouble admitting it. In the episode \"Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats\" Jake gets an injury and Charlie goes out of his way to make sure that he's safe. In the episode \"The Mooch at the Boo\" Jake and his neighbor, a pretty girl named Celeste, disappear together and Celeste's father Jerome (played by [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), an ex-football player, came looking. When they were found kissing, Charlie later said to Jerome that he would take the beating intended for Jake.\n\nCharlie watches a lot of sports on TV, but has little interest in athletics ''per se''; rather, Charlie is a frequent gambler. He watches sports to keep tabs on his investments, and bets on horse races, football matches, etc. Two of his favorite sitcoms are ''[[Dharma and Greg]]'' and ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]''.\n\nDespite his [[upper class]] and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] persona, Charlie can be remarkably [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] about everyday matters. In \"Last Chance to See Those Tattoos,\" Alan observes that Charlie does not really understand how the [[Internet]] works. In \"I Can't Afford Hyenas,\" Charlie is shown to have no understanding of how to care for his own living expenses because he entrusts an accountant with managing his cash flow and paying the bills, but the accountant is actually swindling him. When his accountant is arrested, Charlie is not even aware of a problem until he receives notices from the bank that his accounts are delinquent, his credit cards are maxed out and his car is in danger of being repossessed. He has never done his own laundry, and has no idea how a washing machine works; he believes Alan when he sarcastically says that the machine will call him when the cycle is complete.<ref>Episode 4.10 \"Kissing Abraham Lincoln\"</ref> In the final few months of his life after Chelsea left him, he reverts to his old ways: drinking excessively, gambling, smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] to help him sleep and partying hard for hours. This began to affect him psychologically and physically; he aged considerably, gave himself a bad haircut, broke several toes and received a black eye from one of his adventures in Las Vegas. He eventually admits that his behavior is a way to cope with depression and loneliness.\n\nHe is the only other character besides Alan to appear in every episode until his killing off.\n\n==Reported death==\nCharlie Harper was reported by Rose to have died in [[Paris]] after being struck by a train. The [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|season 9]] premiere featured his funeral with one of Charlie's trademark bowling shirts and a pair of cargo shorts hanging by his closed casket. Rose explained that he had proposed to her in Paris and the next few days had been happy, but when she returned from shopping one day, she found him showering with another woman. The next day he fell off a [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] platform and was struck by a train, his body exploding \"like a balloon full of meat\". It is implied by Rose and suggested by Berta that Rose was responsible for Charlie's death.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 9)#ep178|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=September 19, 2011|season=9|number=1|minutes=02:40}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Alan and Charlie's ghost.jpg|upright|thumb|Charlie's ghost (as portrayed by [[Kathy Bates]])]]\nFollowing his death, Charlie has been frequently mentioned by his surviving (though very few) loved ones. It tends to be in a disrespectful manner and secrets and previously unknown details about his life emerge.\n\nAfter his funeral his ashes are delivered and Alan decides to spread them on the beach but spills them after being scared at seeing [[Walden Schmidt]] at the window, soaking wet. In \"Those Fancy Japanese Toilets\", Charlie is shown to have kept a private journal. He kept it in a safe deposit box at the bank, and after he died, the bank contacted his mother about it. She gives the journal to Alan, who becomes fascinated with it, as the entries give an insight to a whole new side of Charlie that he never saw before. It is revealed that Charlie had postulated about the various causes of his death, including liver failure and being pushed in front of a bus, and that he questioned his condescending behavior towards women. It's revealed that when Charlie first met his nephew Jake, he believed that he was to have a bright future ahead of him, but secretly thought he was not Alan's biological son (implied by him to Alan years prior). It is also hinted that, despite all the criticism and abuse, he actually idolized his brother and missed him when he moved in with Lyndsey, however he knew at the same time that he would be back \"before long\".\n\nIn \"Thank You for the Intercourse\", Walden redecorates the house and therefore donates Charlie's piano to an orphanage. Alan suffers a mental breakdown, after realizing how much he misses Charlie and starts to act like him because of it, even picking up women with much success. Jake and Walden are worried about Alan's strange behavior and Walden then brings Alan to a mental institution after tricking him into believing that they were going for a trip to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and that he stayed at the [[Bellagio (resort and casino)|Bellagio]] penthouse suite.\n\nCharlie is re-introduced into the series in the episode \"Why We Gave Up Women\", portrayed by [[Kathy Bates]]. While Alan is hospitalized for a mild heart attack, he awakens to find a strange woman sitting at the foot of his bed, dressed like Charlie and smoking a cigar. She also introduces herself as Charlie. Still not convinced, Alan asks her questions that only the real Charlie could answer, and she does so correctly. Charlie proceeds to explain that he ended up in [[Hell]], and, as part of his punishment, must live eternity in the body of a large, older woman, albeit with a pair of testicles (he does not consider his new form all bad, as he is able to grope his own breasts). Charlie advises Alan to turn his life around and become self-dependent for once. After the meeting, Alan decides to rent an apartment, which is very low-grade. The following night, Charlie reappears to Alan, and admits that he did not care if Alan changed, but was happy that even though he is dead, he was finally able to get him out of his house. Later, after Alan fakes a second heart attack, in the hospital, Charlie appears to Jake, trying to hint who he is after addressing him by his old pet name \"Tater Head\", but Jake fails to understand. Annoyed, Charlie goes back to Hell, escorted by two sexy women, where he wistfully complains about not having a penis any more.\n\nAccording to [[Chuck Lorre]], the show's producers were so impressed with Bates performance, that they were considering bringing her back in the recurring role of \"Alan's demonic [[spirit guide]]\".<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kathy-Bates-Charlie-1046063.aspx TV Guide website]</ref> Bates did not return to the show after this appearance.\n\nCharlie is mentioned briefly in the season 10 episode \"A Big Bag of Dog\", when Walden has an emotional breakdown upstairs in the master bedroom over a breakup, Berta says that Charlie used to have emotional meltdowns over breakups in that bedroom, too. He is mentioned in the season 10 episode \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\" when Rose returns, Alan asks Walden if she told him that she was stalking his brother, and again when Rose is unsure whether to date Walden as he lives in Charlie's house, but Walden insists that has nothing to do with Alan or himself. He is referenced to by Walden in \"Something My Gynecologist Said\" when he is talking about this fake book he is writing, about a man called Alan who lives with his brother in a beach house, but the brother dies by being pushed in front of a train, and a billionaire comes and buys the house. Berta mentions him in \"I Scream When I Pee\", when saying that she didn't think she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but says that Walden is the greatest boss she ever had, after he comes to cheer her up on her birthday and buys her a car. Alan briefly mentions him in \"Advantage: Fat, Flying Baby\". He is mentioned again in the season 10 finale, \"Cows, Prepare to Be Tipped\", when Alan reveals that Charlie left Jake two of his last cigars for when Jake graduates college. Alan and Jake smoke them and laugh heartily. In \"Big Episode. Someone Stole a Spoon\", after a wild party at the beach house leaves an intense mess with wreckage, Walden come out into the living room and says, \"It looks like Charlie Sheen's house!\", referencing not the character, but the actor himself.\n\n===Daughter===\nIn season 11, a woman knocks on Walden and Alan's door, and introduces herself as Jenny, Charlie's daughter, which surprises Alan to the point of shock, as he never knew that he had a daughter, but amuses Walden. According to Jenny, the last time she saw him alive was at her fourth birthday. Hurt because Charlie didn't want to marry her, Jenny's mother banned him from ever seeing Jenny again. Wanting to somehow provide for Jenny, Charlie would send a lucrative check to the family every month up until his passing. Alan reveals to Jenny that he kept his brother's ashes and put them in the liquor cabinet. He spills his ashes twice in the same day but is happy when he finds two quarters in them. It is also the first time Walden mentions Charlie by name, after previously only referring to him as \"your brother\" or \"Alan's brother\", and he wishes there was something other than Alan that Charlie would have left behind. Berta begins to tell Jenny stories of Charlie's life but Walden stops her and asks if she has any stories for Jenny that don't include drugs, alcohol or hookers, Berta is unable to recall any more stories than ones that include those things. Later at Pavlov's, Jenny, Walden, Alan and Evelyn toast to Charlie as a father, brother, son and guy who bought his beach house after got hit by a train\n\nIn the second episode Evelyn says to her boyfriend that she wasn't the greatest mother to Charlie and Alan, and that she wants to make up for it with Jenny. She asks Jenny if she wants to see pictures of her father at the police station as they will have more pictures of him than she ever took. Walden talks to Charlie's ashes for the first time in season 11, asking him for a sign of advice on what to do about his love life and thanks him for the house, stating, \"you'd have to be on crack to give all this up\". Jenny claims that in her entire life, Charlie only wrote to her once asking \"Are your friends 18 yet?\"\n\n===Return===\nIn the [[series finale]], \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\", a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] reveals that Charlie is not dead but survived an attempt on his life by an angry Rose after she found him having sex with a hooker, a mime, and a goat on their honeymoon. Rose binds and gags him and returns Charlie to the United States where she brainwashes him and confines him to a pit under her house in Sherman Oaks. He escapes after four years, collects $2.5 million in royalty money, and sends messages to Alan, Evelyn, and Walden, warning of his imminent return and threatening revenge against them. He also sends Jenny, his former girlfriends, Berta, and Jake generous checks. In the last moments of the finale, Charlie is seen walking (only shown from the back) to the door of his beach house, when a helicopter is transporting Charlie's grand piano and just as he is about to ring the doorbell of the beach house, the piano drops and Charlie disappears once and for all. No one was particularly happy that Charlie was alive because he was planning to kill them, and because the characters had moved on with their lives and become a closer family unit than they had been when Charlie was alive and lived there.\n\nDespite speculation that Charlie Sheen would make a cameo appearance, he does not appear in the program. Instead, his character is depicted via animation as a re-enactment of events when Rose is explaining what happened in Paris and by a stand-in in the last scene which only shows Charlie from behind.\n\nAccording to showrunner [[Chuck Lorre]], writing in the [[vanity card]] that appeared at the end of the episode, Sheen was offered a role in the finale where he would have \"walk[ed] to the front door in the last scene, ring the doorbell, then turn, look directly into the camera and go off on a maniacal rant about the dangers of drug abuse. He would then explain that these dangers only applied to average people. That he was far from average. He was a ninja warrior from Mars. He was invincible. And then we would drop a piano on him. We thought it was funny. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he wanted us to write a heart warming scene that would set up his return to primetime TV in a new sitcom called ''The Harpers'' starring him and Jon Cryer. We thought that was funny too.\"\n\n==Love life==\nCharlie's love life is a recurring theme in his character. He is an alcoholic [[Womanizing|womanizer]] who has engaged in decades of frequent [[one-night stand]]s, [[prostitute]]s, [[casual sex]], and \"relationships\" of short duration, in stark contrast to his brother Alan's inability to garner much female attention. Even though Charlie usually never calls any of his partners again after he had sex with them, there are a few relationships on the show that lasted longer than one night, notably his neighbor Rose, who continues to stalk him after they spent one night together, and Jake's [[ballet]] teacher Mia, whom Charlie was actually in love with, and almost married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He usually dated much younger women, but starting in season 5, he pursued relationships that were a change of pace for him. He started a relationship with a respected judge played by [[Ming-Na]] and later with a substantially older single mother/author ([[Susan Blakely]]), but he later blew it with both women. In season 6, Charlie proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]], who has also played three other roles in earlier seasons) just to get her to return his love for her. But eventually turns out that it was the only love of his life when he dumped Mia and confessed his love for Chelsea. They remain engaged throughout season 7 until Charlie throws up on a baby, forcing Chelsea to dump him and leaving Charlie heartbroken. At the end of season 8 he goes off with Rose to a romantic getaway in Paris, which ultimately resulted in his 'death'.\n\n==Notable love interests (in order of appearance)==\n\n===Rose===\nCharlie and Rose ([[Melanie Lynskey]]) spent [[one-night stand|one night together]] shortly before the events portrayed in the show; after this, Rose became increasingly obsessed with him. She usually spends time at his beach house when Charlie and Alan are gone, and when they come back they usually find a surprise, such as cabinets that are glued shut. Rose demonstrates her obsession with Charlie in numerous ways: when taking up with Charlie's pizza boy Gordon, she flaunted him to Charlie in an obvious but useless attempt to make the latter jealous; she then attempted to mold Gordon into Charlie by dressing him in short pants and designer bowling shirts like those Charlie usually wears, and instructing him to try to emulate Charlie's poses; she has named all of her five ferrets Charlie.<ref name=\"TSUMS\">{{cite episode|title=The Salmon Under My Sweater|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Foster, Don|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=November 10, 2004|season=2|number=10}}</ref> Rose's father (portrayed by Sheen's real-life father [[Martin Sheen|Martin]]) became similarly obsessed with Charlie's mother Evelyn; Charlie and Evelyn sought \"expert\" assistance (i.e., Rose) to get rid of him. Charlie is usually charmed by Rose, but is not interested in a relationship with her, even though Berta thinks they are a good couple together. When Rose decided to leave to go to [[London, England|London]] Charlie believed that she was only pretending in order to get him into a relationship with her; after she really left, Charlie realized that he made a horrible mistake by letting Rose go.<ref name=\"MDS\">{{cite episode|title=My Damn Stalker|episodelink=List of Two and a Half Men episodes|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|credits=Lorre, Chuck; Aronsohn, Lee; Roberts, Mark; Gorodetsky, Eddie|network=[[CBS]]|airdate=February 12, 2007|season=4|number=15}}</ref> He then went to London to meet her but quickly returned home when Rose started talking about his moving there and starting a family together. Rose has since returned to Malibu and continues to stalk Charlie. As of \"The Devil's Lube,\" there is a chance of a future relationship between the two; in this episode Charlie points out that he has not seen Rose in a while, but she cannot say the same. In \"Above Exalted Cyclops,\" Rose, after being set up by Chelsea, now has moved on from Charlie and is stalking Alan, or possibly stalking both brothers. In \"Gumby with a Pokey\" (her only appearance in Season 7), she is still noted as Charlie's stalker, implying that she is either done stalking Alan and back to Charlie, or stalking both brothers. Gordon is unaware of Rose's brief relationship with Alan.<ref>When Charlie introduces Gordon to Alan's ex-wife's new husband Herb and Alan's girlfriend's ex-husband Chris in ep. 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\" Gordon claims that he has not had sex with anyone in Alan's life.</ref> In Season 8's \"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\" Rose is again stalking Charlie. This time it has become too much for Charlie's new girlfriend Michelle, who is convinced that Charlie loves Rose. Rose tells Charlie that she is marrying a guy named \"Manfred Quinn,\" which appears to be verified when Charlie and Alan go to the church and peer through a door window to see a wedding in progress. The two walk away, with Charlie confused and apparently heartbroken. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that, with the exception of the priest and Rose, all the other attendants are [[mannequin]]s (hence the name of Rose's purported groom: Manfred \"Manny\" Quinn). Later in Season 8, Charlie tells Rose that he loves her and they begin a romantic relationship with Charlie even taking her on a romantic getaway to Paris despite the fact that he still thinks she is truly married. It is implied that Rose has something to do with Charlie's death in Paris after it is revealed she caught him having an affair. Charlie had proposed to her in Paris also which was mentioned by Rose at Charlie's funeral and Rose said yes to the proposal. In \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\", Rose begins a relationship with Walden, and after \"Ferrets, Attack!\" begins stalking him and ruining his life.\n\n===Jill/Bill===\nBill ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) was a previous girlfriend of Charlie's appearing in a season one episode, \"An Old Flame with a New Wick\". Bill had since had sexual-reassignment surgery and was formerly living as ''Jill''. Charlie comments during the episode that while the relationship was passionate, sex with Bill was \"a little weird\". As the episode progresses, Bill begins dating Charlie's mother Evelyn (she is initially unaware of Bill's history). Once Bill's identity is revealed to her, she faints, but decides to continue seeing Bill. Bill was never seen or mentioned again.\n\n===Lisa===\nLisa ([[Denise Richards]]) was Charlie's favorite ex-girlfriend. She appeared in one season 1 and one season 2 episode. In \"Merry Thanksgiving,\" Charlie proposed to her but she decided to marry another man. In \"Yes, Monsignor,\" Charlie had to prove that he is good with babies when he found out she had one (played by Richards' and Sheen's real-life first daughter Sam). Notably, she was absent at Charlie's funeral.\n\n===Delores Pasternak===\nMiss Delores Pasternak ([[Missi Pyle]], also [[Alicia Witt]] in season 6) was Jake's fifth-grade teacher. Charlie charmed her to save Jake from suspension for flipping her off, but she proved to be a domineering/school-marm type, driving Charlie to break up with her, after which she had a meltdown that got her fired from teaching and disowned by her family, leaving her to become a bikini dancer. After running into each other four years later (see \"A Jock Strap in Hell\"), Charlie feels guilty about this and hires her as Jake's private tutor, leading them to resume their romantic relationship. She quickly reverts to her religious self and Charlie breaks up with her again. She was seen at Charlie's funeral, where she mentioned he made tea using her panties.\n\n===Isabella===\nIsabella ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]) was Charlie's Goth girlfriend known to bring a dark atmosphere with her. She and several of her girlfriends \"anoint\" Charlie as their king in a ceremony, \"bonding\" them for life. It's revealed that she knows Evelyn from [[Pilates]] class, and Isabella was unaware that Charlie and Alan are Evelyn's sons. Isabella was at Charlie's funeral, where she mentions that Charlie gave her [[Herpes simplex|herpes]].\n\n===Kandi===\nCharlie had a brief relationship with Kandi ([[April Bowlby]], credited as \"Kymber\"), after which she married his brother, [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan]]. Kandi is depicted as hot and young (half the age of Alan or Charlie), with a \"[[dumb blonde]]\" stereotype, even though she is a redhead.\n\n===Mia===\nMia ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]) is a ballet teacher, whom Charlie had a crush on, and was engaged to for a short while. Charlie decided not to marry Mia after she insisted that Alan and Jake must move out of the house, only to find out that Alan had married [[Kandi (Two and a Half Men)|Kandi]] and moved out. Charlie later became sexually reckless and depressed, because he learned that Mia was going to marry someone else. Charlie blamed Alan for ruining everything, but later realizes that he was just looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. They reunited in person at the end of season 6's \"Baseball Was Better With Steroids,\" resulting in a cliffhanger for the season finale. In season 7's premiere \"818-jklpuzo\", Mia appears in much less favorable light. Mia asks Charlie for help with a singing career, but in reality she appears to want him back. By this time, Charlie had begun a relationship with Chelsea, and is now torn between the two. While in the studio recording a demo tape, Mia asks Charlie for sex after revealing that she is a horrible singer. Charlie tells Mia she cannot sing, and chooses Chelsea. As Charlie rushes away he turns off Mia's microphone, so that he cannot hear her yell and swear at him. Mia was at Charlie's funeral, demanding to see the body.\n\n===Lydia===\nShortly after he cancelled his wedding with Mia, Charlie began dating a rude real-estate agent named Lydia ([[Katherine LaNasa]]). Alan, Jake, Rose and Berta did not like her and made this clear to Charlie, but when she met his mother, Evelyn, the four realised that she and Evelyn were exactly alike in character. Bobby, the waiter at Charlie's and Evelyn's favorite restaurant, was the first to recognise Lydia's similarity to Evelyn. When Lydia began bossing Berta around, Berta threatened to quit unless Charlie broke up with her. Lydia meanwhile threatened to break up with Charlie unless he fired Berta. In the end, Charlie broke up with Lydia, and Berta would only return if Charlie admitted his [[sexual addiction]] and attended rehab. At Charlie's funeral, Lydia mentions that Charlie loved being spanked.\n\n===Myra===\nMyra ([[Judy Greer]]) is the sister of Herb Melnick (Judith's husband after Alan). She bonded with Charlie over their hatred of Judith. Judith did not want the two dating, and would take her frustration out on Alan. Judith did not want Charlie coming over to her house either, so Charlie invited Myra to his house. Even though she was supposed to be sleeping in Jake's room, Myra slept with Charlie, leaving Alan and Jake to hear them and find out the truth. When Charlie wanted to pursue the relationship, he was heartbroken to learn that she was engaged and he'd have to drive her to the airport after the wedding, and that he'd never see her again. Greer again appears in Season 9 as Walden's ex-wife.\n\n===Linda Harris===\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, Charlie dated Judge Linda Harris ([[Ming-Na]]), a judge of his own age. Their relationship ended in the middle of the same season, after Linda concluded that she couldn't \"be connected publicly to a guy like [Charlie]\" after he publicly humiliated her (under the influence of his mother's \"medication\") at an event held in her honor. The random songs which Charlie sang to her son Brandon while babysitting, essentially launched his show-biz persona, \"Charlie Waffles\".\n\n===Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman===\nCharlie also fell for his future stepsister, \"Courtney\" ([[Jenny McCarthy]]) in Season 5, and after agreeing to stop seeing her due to their relationship to each other, he lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes moments before they become step-siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart-broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia, but he apparently retains feelings for her, telling her that he will \"wait\" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's \"Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\" (as Courtney) after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her.<ref>\"Two and a Half Men Review: Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\". Article at TVFanatic.com [http://www.tvfanatic.com/2010/11/two-and-a-half-men-review-ow-ow-dont-stop/ TV Fanatic]</ref> Courtney and Charlie break up two episodes later in \"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead\" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. Although surprisingly she holds a lot of resentment towards him at his funeral in the season 9 opener. In the season 9 episode \"Nine Magic Fingers\", Courtney starts dating [[Walden Schmidt]] ([[Ashton Kutcher]]), but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget, Walden's wife, successfully convince Walden that Courtney is simply a con artist.\n\n===Angie===\nNear the end of season 5, Charlie met an older woman ([[Susan Blakely]]) named Angie who was also the author of a relationship self-help book that he was interested in reading. Angie has been described as a mother figure to Charlie, more so than even his own mother, Evelyn. When Angie introduced him to her grown son Jeremy and his fiancee Tricia (Virginia Williams), Charlie realized that he had dated Tricia earlier in his life. After Tricia revealed that she still had feelings for Charlie, Tricia dumped Jeremy, and Angie became, as Alan describes, a \"mean drunk\" who verbally lashed out at Charlie and furiously broke up with him.\n\n===Melissa===\nIn a season 6 episode (\"The Flavin' and the Mavin'\"), Charlie is annoyed that he has to drive Alan to work, until he meets Alan's spunky young receptionist, Melissa ([[Kelly Stables]]). Alan begs Charlie not to hit on her, as it will likely end badly and complicate their working relationship, but Charlie ignores him. Charlie sleeps with Melissa, then becomes annoyed when she constantly hangs around his house. Melissa becomes vindictive when she realizes that Charlie is not serious about their relationship. As Alan suspected, the failed relationship causes Melissa to demand a raise and health insurance. (Melissa would later date Alan in several episodes of seasons 6, 7 and 8, becoming the third of Charlie's ex-girlfriends to later date Alan.)\n\n===Chelsea===\nChelsea Christine Melini ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Taylor]]) starts dating Charlie in season 6, and is the first woman to whom he confessed his love without prompting. He says this nearly by accident, but claims he meant it. At first, Chelsea was another one of Charlie's one-night stands, but it soon evolved into a relationship. The relationship comes to a rut with Chelsea wanting to break up, but after some couples counseling, the two remained together. Charlie proposed to her, ring and all, just to get her to say \"I love you\" back to him, and until the middle of season 7, they were engaged to be married. When Chelsea moved into the Harper beach house, Charlie rented out her vacant apartment to get alone time. Chelsea has a cat named \"Sir Lancelot\", who was almost never seen on-camera (two exceptions are in \"Mmm, fish. Yum.\" and \"Tinkle Like a Princess\") and was constantly being stepped on, mostly by Charlie, but once by Alan. Chelsea got along well with Evelyn, much to Charlie's chagrin, and had a very rocky relationship with her nephew-to-be Jake, until Charlie forced them to work out their issues. Charlie had a telephone video of one of their lovemaking events, but when Chelsea found out, she erased the video herself. The two eventually broke up due to Charlie's jealousy towards her friendship with Alan's lawyer, Brad. Charlie then made matters worse by vomiting on a baby in public while apologizing to her, and subsequently slept with Chelsea's best friend, Gail ([[Tricia Helfer]]). Chelsea's last appearance was in the first episode of Season 9, when she announced at Charlie's funeral that he gave her [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]; Gail, who also attended, said Charlie gave ''her'' vaginal warts.\n\n===Betsy===\nBetsy ([[Katy Mixon]]) first met the Harper brothers the day Charlie and Chelsea set the date for their wedding. Panicked over the impending end of his bachelor lifestyle, Charlie finds himself blacked out drunk in bed with Betsy and Alan shortly after their meeting in Pavlov's Bar. With little memory of the night's events, Alan and Charlie left her home before dawn. Only remembering flashes of himself, his brother, and Betsy fooling around naked, shortly after Alan performed a striptease in drag, Charlie went to his mother for advice. To help wipe the disturbing memories from Charlie's mind, Evelyn told him of the time she cheated on her third husband with circus folk, including a clown, strongman, bearded lady, acrobats, and dwarfs, in one debased night. Traumatized by Evelyn's story, Charlie's few memories of the night were now replaced with images of his mother's circus orgy. When Charlie and Betsy encounter each other again, they immediately run off to Las Vegas and have a \"quickie\" wedding. But the marriage is soon rendered invalid when it is revealed that Betsy is already married.\n\n===Michelle===\nMichelle ([[Liz Vassey]]) is Charlie's dermatologist. In \"Twanging Your Magic Clanger,\" they met when Charlie was getting a mole removed from his behind. They went to a movie and Charlie was surprised to learn that she is older than he is. After Alan telling him that he's probably gonna be dead for ten years by the time she turns 70 (which ironically came true, as he died not too long after), he went to Michelle and told her that he was interested in being in a relationship with her. He then met Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, which led him to briefly think about sex with the daughter. But after finding out that she thinks \"older guys\" (much younger than Charlie) are bad to have sex with, he returns to Michelle. In \"The Crazy Bitch Gazette,\" Michelle and Charlie went on a date where they had lunch with Evelyn and Alan, causing a few embarrassing details about Charlie's past to slip out. When they got to Charlie's house, Charlie introduced Michelle to Berta and told Michelle about his past girlfriends and other sordid details of his life. To Charlie's surprise, Michelle still wanted to be with him. Later that night, Charlie's neighbor/stalker Rose appeared on his deck. Michelle was upset with Charlie, because he did not mention Rose in any of his confessions. Nor did he mention the fact that she constantly stalked him. The next week, Charlie went to Michelle's house with flowers and begged her to give him another chance. Michelle broke up with Charlie anyway, convinced that he still had feelings for Rose. At Charlie's funeral, Michelle builds on Lydia's remark about him by adding that he liked being spanked while wearing Michelle's panties.\n\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Two_and_a_Half_Men#Charlie|Charlie Harper}}\n* [http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/11290/TV/Charlie+Harpers+Girlfriends+from+Two++a+Half+Men.aspx Small list of Charlie's famous girlfriends]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090222124844/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/01/networkproven_names_pull_in_sy.php TV week article]\n* Vincent Terrace, Encyclopedia of Television Subjects, Themes and Settings (McFarland & Co., 2007), {{ISBN|0-7864-2498-2}}, 978-0-7864-2498-6, found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7NkAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Charlie+Harper%22+%2B+%22Two+and+a+Half+Men%22&dq=%22Charlie+Harper%22+%2B+%22Two+and+a+Half+Men%22&as_brr=0&pgis=1 Google Books from the University of Michigan]\n* [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/02/10/2009-02-10_wingman_lands_a_little_off_target-1.html Daily News article]\n* [http://eventful.com/woodlandhills/events/its-curtains-charlie-harper-free-comedy-even-/E0-001-041720966-0 Comedic \"Funeral\" Event for Charlie held on September 18, 2011]\n* John Kenneth Muir, TV Year: The Prime Time 2005\u20132006 Season (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007)\n{{ISBN|1-55783-684-1}}, 978-1-55783-684-7\n* Stephen F.

ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the [[foreign minister]]s of five countries: \n[[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[Thailand]], signed the [[ASEAN Declaration]]. As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

Masilamani and Peterson summarize it as \"a working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilize compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritizes a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems.

Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.<ref name=Leviter>{{cite journal|last1=Leviter|first1=Lee|title=The ASEAN Charter: ASEAN Failure or Member Failure?|journal=New York University Journal of International Law and Politics|date=2010|volume=43|pages=159\u2013210}}</ref>{{RP|161-163}}[[File:ASEAN with Plus 3 and Plus 6.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|<span style=\"color:#1743a6\">'''Blue'''</span>: [[ASEAN]] <br> <span style=\"color:#6330d5\">'''Purple'''</span>: [[ASEAN#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] <br> <span style=\"color:#0d63ac\">'''Teal'''</span>: [[ASEAN#ASEAN Plus Six|ASEAN Plus Six]]]] \n[[ASEAN#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] was the first of attempts for further integration to improve existing ties with [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]].

The Vision was adopted at the 27th Summit on November 2015 in Kuala Lumpur. The ASEAN community would revise and renew its vision every ten years to provide a framework for continuous development and further integration. The terms in the Vision are divided into four subcategories, namely APSC, AEC, ASCC, and Moving Forward. APSC issues are covered under articles 7 and 8. The former generally states the overall aspiration of the community aiming for a united, inclusive and resilient community. It also puts human and environmental security as crucial points. Deepening engagement with both internal and external parties are also stressed to contribute to international peace, security and stability.<ref>{{cite web|title=ASEAN COMMUNITY VISION 2025|url=http://www.asean.org/storage/images/2015/November/aec-page/ASEAN-Community-Vision-2025.pdf}}</ref> The \"Moving Forward\" subcategory implies the acknowledgement of weaknesses of the institution's capacity to process and coordinate ASEAN work.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second two-year term until 26 May 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Food security====\nMember states recognise the importance of strengthening [[food security]] to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Security |url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |website=World Health Organisation |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917112705/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2015 |df= }}</ref> As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|last2=Caballero-Anthony|first2=Mely|last3=Teng|first3=Paul|title=Thought/Issues Paper on ASEAN Food Security: Towards a more Comprehensive Framework|date=Oct 2013|publisher=Nanyang Technological University|location=Singapore |url=http://www.eria.org/ERIA-DP-2013-20.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.<ref>Overland, Indra et al.

[[Trade facilitation]] measures and the harmonisation/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products.

The second plan (2009-2015) supports the goals of the ASEAN Community and is composed of 182 prescribed actions, which includes studies, training programs, and policy implementation support, conducted through projects supported by older ASEAN member states, and ASEAN's Dialogue partners and external parties. The IAI Work Plan is patterned after and supports the key program areas in the three ASEAN Community Blueprints: ASPC, AEC, and ASCC. The IAI Task Force, composed of representatives of the Committee of Permanent Representatives and its working group from all member states, is in charge of providing general advice and policy guidelines and directions in the design and implementation of the plan. All member states are represented in the IAI Task Force, chaired by representatives of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam. The ASEAN Secretariat, in particular through the IAI and NDG Division, supports the implementation and management of the IAI Work Plan and coordinates activities related to sub-regional frameworks.

It delivers a challenge to construct dynamic institutions and foster sufficient amount of social capital. The underlying assumption is that the creation of a regional identity is of special interest to ASEAN and the intent of the 2020 Vision policy document was to reassert the belief in a regional framework designed as an action plan related to human development and civic empowerment. Accordingly, these assumptions will be the basis for recommendations and strategies in developing a participatory regional identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Michael E.|title=Forging an ASEAN Identity: The Challenge to Construct a Shared Destiny|journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia|date=2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=140\u2013154|url=https://www.academia.edu/981239|accessdate=12 February 2015|doi=10.1355/cs26-1g}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n|+ '''ASEAN members by <br>[[Human Development Index]]'''<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book|title=Global 2019 Human Development Report Overview - English |date=2019|publisher=United Nations Development Program (UNDP)|location=New York|pages=22\u201324|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr_2019_overview_-_english.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:120px\" | Country\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" cosplan |HDI {{small|(2018)}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Singapore}}\n| '''0.935''' (highest)\n|<span style=\"color:darkgreen;\">'''very high'''</span>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Brunei}}\n| 0.845\n| very high\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Malaysia}}\n| 0.804\n| very high\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Thailand}}\n| 0.765\n| high\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | '''[[File:Flag_of_ASEAN.svg|29x15px]] [[ASEAN]]'''\n| '''0.723''' (average)\n| '''high'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Philippines}}\n| 0.712\n| high\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Indonesia}}\n| 0.707\n| high\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Vietnam}}\n| 0.694\n| medium\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Laos}}\n| 0.604\n| medium\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Myanmar}}\n| 0.584\n| medium\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | {{flagcountry|Cambodia}}\n| '''0.581''' (lowest)\n|<span style=\"color:orange;\">'''medium'''</span>\n|-\n|}\n\n[[File:GDP PPP 2018 Selection.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|Selection of GDP PPP data (top 10 countries and blocks) in no particular order]]\n\nThe group sought economic integration by creating the AEC by the end of 2015 that established a [[single market]].<ref name=\"asil1\">Sim, Edmund \"Introduction to the ASEAN Economic Community\", https://web.archive.org/web/20120218183029/http://www.asil.org/aseanevent/Sim_Intro_to_ASEAN.pdf</ref>\nThe average economic growth of member states from 1989 to 2009 was between 3.8% and 7%.

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.<ref>{{cite news|title=New ASEAN community offers export opportunities|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/253874/new-asean-community-offers-export-opportunities.html|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Vietnam News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Asian Development Bank]] also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline.

As set out in the Declaration, the aims and purposes of ASEAN are to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, to promote regional peace, collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest, to provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities, to collaborate for better utilization of agriculture and industry to raise the living standards of the people, to promote [[Southeast Asian studies]] and to maintain close, beneficial co-operation with existing international organisations with similar aims and purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|title=The Asean Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) Bangkok, 8 August 1967|publisher=ASEAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121705/http://www.asean.org/news/item/the-asean-declaration-bangkok-declaration|archivedate=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=17 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.org/asean/about-asean/overview|title=Overview|website=asean.org|publisher=ASEAN|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of ASEAN was motivated by a common fear of [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author1=Bernard Eccleston |author2=Michael Dawson |author3=Deborah J.

The region's dynamic economic growth during the 1970s strengthened the organization, enabling ASEAN to adopt a unified response to [[Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia|Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia]] in 1979. ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a [[Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia|Treaty of Amity and Cooperation]], and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the [[Cold War]] allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.<ref>Moon, C.

The ASEAN community would revise and renew its vision every ten years to provide a framework for continuous development and further integration.

Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.{{efn|name=fn1|''ASEAN Financial Integration: The Long Road to Bank Consolidation'' and ''The Philippines' Banking System: The Good, the Bad and the Ambivalent''.}} The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/sp-cites-moves-by-philippine-banks/|title=S&P cites moves by Philippine banks|author=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref> As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration \u2013 playing defence and strengthening their domestic networks\".<ref name=\"mb.com.ph\"/>\n\n====Financial integration roadmap====\nThe roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realisation of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalisation, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalisation would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn regards to a common currency, ASEAN leaders agreed in November 1999 to create the establishment of currency swaps and repurchase agreements as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, ASEAN finance ministers agreed to plan for closer cooperation through the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI).<ref>Financial Integration and Common Currency Area in ASEAN</ref> The CMI has two components, an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement (ASA), and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the ASEAN Plus Three. The ASA preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis and was originally established by the monetary authorities of the five founding member states to help meet temporary liquidity problems. The ASA now includes all ten member states with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among the ASEAN Plus Three has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for member states with balance-of-payments difficulties. In 2009, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) were concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralzation</ref> The CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 and took effect on 20 March 2014 while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. The CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement governed by a single contractual agreement. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse economies and to support the CMIM decision-making process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The amendments would allow access for the ASEAN Plus Three and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an IMF program from 20%\u201330%, and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.<ref>The Amended Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) Comes Into Effect Today, 17 July 2014 Media Releases</ref>\n\nDuring peacetime, the AMRO would conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and prepare quarterly-consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. In a time of crisis, the AMRO would prepare recommendations on any swap request based on macroeconomic analysis of a member state and monitor the use and impact of funds once an application is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second two-year term until 26 May 2016.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Food security====\nMember states recognise the importance of strengthening [[food security]] to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Security |url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |website=World Health Organisation |accessdate=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917112705/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2015 |df= }}</ref> As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|last2=Caballero-Anthony|first2=Mely|last3=Teng|first3=Paul|title=Thought/Issues Paper on ASEAN Food Security: Towards a more Comprehensive Framework|date=Oct 2013|publisher=Nanyang Technological University|location=Singapore |url=http://www.eria.org/ERIA-DP-2013-20.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.<ref>Overland, Indra et al.

It delivers a challenge to construct dynamic institutions and foster sufficient amount of social capital. The underlying assumption is that the creation of a regional identity is of special interest to ASEAN and the intent of the 2020 Vision policy document was to reassert the belief in a regional framework designed as an action plan related to human development and civic empowerment.

It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders.\n\nHowever, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Towards ASEAN Financial Integration</ref> Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.<ref>Cost and Benefits for A Common Currency in ASEAN</ref>\n\n===Free trade===\nFree trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs.

The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.<ref>{{cite news|title=New ASEAN community offers export opportunities|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/253874/new-asean-community-offers-export-opportunities.html|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=Vietnam News|date=19 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Asian Development Bank]] also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline.

The show initially centers on seven characters: brothers [[Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Charlie]] and [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan Harper]]; Jake Harper, the dimwitted son of Alan and his first ex-wife; Judith Harper-Melnick, Alan's first ex-wife, Herb's ex-wife, and Jake and Milly's mother; Rose, one of Charlie's previous one night stands who continuously stalks him; Evelyn Harper, Charlie and Alan's wealthy, five time widowed, [[bisexual]] mother, and Jake's grandmother; and last of all, Berta, Charlie's sharp-tongued housekeeper, who later joins the main cast starting with season two after playing a major recurring role throughout the first season. In season nine, the show is revamped when Charlie is struck and killed by a moving train. [[Walden Schmidt]] replaces him as the new owner of the beach house, a recently divorced internet billionaire. In season eleven, Jake moves to Japan and leaves the series, so to replace \"the half-man\", Charlie's long-lost-daughter moves into the beach house after looking for her late father.\n\nOver time, several supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Berta (season 1 recurring; season 2\u201312 regular), Charlie and Alan's (and later Walden's) sharp-tongued housekeeper; Kandi (season 3 recurring; season 4 regular; season 10 guest), one of Charlie's former one night stands, and later on, Alan's second ex-wife; Chelsea (season 6 recurring; season 7 regular; season 9 guest), Charlie's second most notable love interest (after Rose), and ex-fianc\u00e9e; [[Walden Schmidt]] (season 9\u201312), an internet billionaire who buys Charlie's beach house after his death; Jenny (season 11\u201312), Charlie's illegitimate daughter from a one-night stand twenty years before; last of all, Louis (season 12), the 6-year-old boy that Walden decides to adopt.

Charlie was a jingle writer and a children's music performer under the name Charlie Waffles. Charlie spent his days partying, sleeping, gambling, drinking alcohol, womanizing and wearing bowling shirts. He had many major serious romantic relationships, one was with his [[Stalking|stalker]], Rose, a ballerina and dance teacher named Mia and Chelsea.  He was the opposite of Alan: [[wealth]]y, confident, and charismatic.

While Alan is in the hospital, Charlie's [[ghost]] appears to him (It is implied that this is due to a hallucinogenic reaction due to the medication Alan was on.) and explains that his spirit now lives on in Hell forced to live eternally in a woman's body ([[Kathy Bates]]) as punishment for his womanizing behavior during his lifetime. He acts as his brother's spirit guide, though he later confessed that he really could not care less about what he does. Before returning to the afterlife, Charlie tries to reveal himself to Jake but fails. As a result of [[retroactive continuity]], the series finale reveals that Charlie never died but has been held captive by Rose in a basement pit under her house in Sherman Oaks. He escapes, collects $2.5 million in royalty money from his children's songs, and sends Alan, Evelyn and Walden, who Rose has told him about, texts and emails promising revenge while also sending large checks to his former romantic interests, Jenny, and Jake. However, as he is about to enter the beach house a grand piano being transported to the house by helicopter falls on him, killing him thus ending the show.\n\n=== Alan Harper ===\n{{main|Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)}}\nDr. Alan Jerome Harper ([[Jon Cryer]], Seasons 1\u201312), Charlie's younger brother, who is well-meaning but continuously makes poor choices and mistakes, while also being bullied by Charlie, Berta and Judith. He and his ex-wife, Judith, are Jake's parents, and Alan is possibly the biological father of Judith's second child, a daughter named Millie Melnick. After losing his house to Judith in the divorce, he moves in with Charlie. He is generally a pleasant and supportive man, but seems to have an attraction to women who treat him poorly, which may stem from the non-nurturing relationship he had with his and Charlie's mother. In the [[Two and a Half Men (season 4)|season 4]] episode, \"Repeated Blows to His Unformed Head\", it is revealed that Alan has a [[Maieusiophilia|pregnancy fetish]], which he says is due to Judith only varying from her [[sexless marriage]] policy while pregnant with Jake. Also, in the [[Two and a Half Men (season 6)|Season 6]] episode, \"She'll Still Be Dead at Halftime\", he confesses that he likes feet (see [[foot fetish]]). In the season 3 finale, Alan marries a twenty-two-year-old dumbbell named Kandi who was one of Charlie's former girlfriends. After Charlie had canceled his wedding with Mia, Alan and Kandi got married instead. Although in the season 4 premiere, four months after the marriage Kandi throws Alan out of her condo and divorces Alan which leads him to paying alimony to two ex-wives.\n\nIn season six, Alan starts his first serious relationship since his second divorce. Alan starts dating his receptionist, Melissa. The relationship gets serious when Melissa has Alan move in with her and her mother, but their happiness is short lived when Melissa's mother gets Alan high on brownies and seduces him. Melissa walks in on them, but Alan is too high to explain what happened. Melissa breaks up with Alan and kicks him out. In the season six finale, while Judith is giving birth to what is possibly Alan's daughter, Alan and Melissa meet up and have sex in a closet, ultimately getting back together. Their relationship goes into season seven where Melissa wants to move into the beach house with Alan, Charlie, and Chelsea. Alan is happy to live with Melissa at first, but eventually Melissa and Chelsea start taking over the house, resulting in Alan and Charlie staying at a hotel. Alan and Charlie call Evelyn to fix everything. Evelyn tells Chelsea about Melissa's short lived romance resulting in the girls getting into a fight, and Melissa moving out. Alan and Melissa are now forced to have sex in their car since Melissa won't let Alan see her mother at her house, and Melissa doesn't want to see Chelsea at Alan's house. Melissa tells Alan to get his own house, so Alan steals the keys to a house Evelyn is selling, and lies to Melissa, saying that it's his. When Alan and Melissa get caught, they sneak out the window, but the cops find Alan in nothing but his briefs and when he tries to explain what happened, he turns to Melissa only to find she's gone.\n\nTowards the end of season seven, Alan starts dating Lyndsey McElroy, the mother of Jake's friend, Eldridge, and Judith's neighbor. Alan and Lyndsey date for the last three episodes of the seventh season, and their relationship goes into season eight. Lyndsey and Alan get serious and Lyndsey has Alan move in with her. After moving in, Alan goes to the liquor store where he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Melissa. Alan and Melissa start an affair, but the affair is short lived when he decides to move on from Melissa and continue his relationship with Lyndsey. At Lyndsey's house, Alan smokes a pipe which Lynsey finds sexy. Lyndsey takes Alan upstairs to have sex, but Alan didn't realize he put the pipe down while it was still lit, resulting in him burning down Lyndsey's house. Lyndsey stays mad at Alan for most of the next episode, but when she finally forgives him, her ex-husband Chris steps in and makes up with Lyndsey, leaving Alan brokenhearted and alone again. Several episodes later, Lyndsey breaks up with her ex-husband when she realizes she's lost feelings for him. Alan and Lyndsey get back together, and date for rest of the eighth season.\n\nAlan is two years younger than Charlie. Prior to ''Two and a Half Men,'' Cryer and Sheen appeared together in the 1991 comedy ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' Cryer also won the 2009 Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Alan stays at the house as Walden temporarily lets him after helping him with Bridget, but Walden later insists that Alan stay with him permanently when Alan, with Bridget's help, saves him from Courtney ([[Jenny McCarthy]]), a femme fatale who previously had a relationship with Charlie, and was out to get Walden's money. Alan and Walden became best friends after that. This friendship eventually earned Alan a position as a board member of Walden's company and his name on the deed of the beach house. Walden also renamed his company \"Walden Loves Alan Enterprises\" in honor of his best friend. As of season 9, Cryer is the only actor on the show to appear in every episode of the series. Alan continues his romance with Lyndsey during season nine, only for her to break up with him again after she finds out about all of his lies.\n\nWhile Walden is dating Zoey, Zoey sees right through Alan and knows that he is sponging off Walden. Walden and Zoey go on a date one night and reluctantly take Alan with them. At dinner, Alan sees his ex-girlfriend Lyndsey. Alan and Lyndsey reconcile at the end of the episode. Alan dates Lyndsey throughout the rest of season nine, and reveals to Jake that he and Lyndsey have no intention of getting married.\n\nIn season ten, Walden starts to grow tired of Alan living with him, and begins to get more annoyed. Alan continues to sponge off of Walden for money, and Walden continuously asks when he is moving out. Alan and Lyndsey continue their relationship, but Lyndsey starts to fantasize about other people when seeing Alan. In \"Something My Gynecologist Said\", Lyndsey asks Alan for a commitment since her gynecologist asked her out. Alan is reluctant, resulting in Lyndsey breaking up with him again. That night, Alan goes over to Lyndsey's house and proposes to her. Alan tells her that as soon as he has enough money, he'll put a deposit down on a ring.\n\nNot too long after getting engaged, Alan gets an email from his second ex-wife, Kandi who's in town and wants to get coffee. Kandi tries getting back together with Alan, but he refuses due to his relationship with Lyndsey. Towards the end of season ten, Lyndsey breaks up with Alan after she feels like all the spark in their relationship is gone.\n\nIn the final episode, Alan tries to take the $2.5 million in back royalties from Charlie and ends up fleeing from a very angry dungeon escapee (Charlie). Finally he is back as always living at the beach house since Lyndsey doesn't appear to be marrying him.\n\n=== Jake Harper ===\nJacob David<ref name=\"S01E17\">{{cite episode|title=Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats|series=Two and a Half Men|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 1)#ep17|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|date=February 23, 2004|season=1|number=17}}</ref> \"Jake\" Harper (born November 14, 1993) ([[Angus T. Jones]], Seasons 1\u201310; main, Season 12; guest) is the son of Alan and Judith, while [[E. G. Daily]] provided the singing voice for Jake in the opening and closing theme songs of seasons 1\u20138, and the first two episodes of season 9. He spends most of his free time playing video games, eating, watching television, playing the guitar, sleeping, and getting high with his best friend Eldridge. He is also an excellent poker player and a fairly good cook, but is very uneducated and stubborn, which coupled with his excessive [[flatulence]], is a frequent theme of jokes about him. Despite his apparent lack of intelligence, he is sometimes very observant. He is friendly, innocent and he clearly loves his father and uncle, but is often dismissive towards them. He blamed his parents [[divorce]] on Alan for many years and continually rebelled against him for that reason and it was only after he enlisted that he realized that Judith had more to do with the divorce than he'd originally thought. Jake's style, personality and attitude changes as the series progresses, from a more cute, little-boy charm in the first season to a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] teenager in later seasons. After Charlie's death, Jake at first does not show any emotion but it is later revealed that, like Alan, he painfully misses him and still [[Grief|grieves his death]] (though not as bad as Alan). He proceeds to tell his father that the most important thing Charlie taught him was that when he is his uncle's age he wants to be married and have a family, because Charlie seemed very lonely and unhappy. Despite his young age, he has proven himself to be charming enough to get sex from older women (as evidenced in seasons 9 and 10). Jake and Eldridge decide to join the Army following their high school graduation. Jake forms a friendship with Walden, who buys the beach house, and has such an impact on his life he tells Walden that he would name his child with his then girlfriend Tammy, Walden Harper. At the end of the tenth season he announces to the household that he is being shipped to [[Japan]] for a year. He and Alan go on a father son bonding trip together (one that he wanted Walden to come on) before he leaves.\n\nThough mentioned often, Jake is absent throughout all of season 11, and is also featured (via archive footage) in a montage paying tribute to him in the fifth episode of season 12.\n\n[[Angus T. Jones]] makes a cameo appearance reprising his role in the second half of the series finale in season 12, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\". Jake is passing through town and pays a visit to Alan and Walden, informing them that he is no longer in the army and has gotten married to a Japanese dancer, and is the stepfather to her two children. He also mentions that Charlie (who is revealed to still be alive) sent him a check for $250,000 along with a note that simply states \"I'm alive\". Upon learning that Charlie is on the loose and is out to kill Alan and Walden, a scared Jake bids Alan, Walden, and Berta goodbye as he immediately leaves the beach house for the final time. Both his entrance and exit are followed by a long studio applause.\n\n=== Walden Schmidt ===\n{{main|Walden Schmidt}}\nWalden Schmidt ([[Ashton Kutcher]], Seasons 9\u201312) is a [[billionaire]] [[internet entrepreneur]] who has recently been divorced and was suicidal when Alan first met him. When Charlie supposedly dies and leaves the house to Alan, Alan puts the house on the market because he is unable to make payments on the three mortgages. Guest stars [[John Stamos]], [[Jenna Elfman]] and [[Thomas Gibson]] view the house but do not buy it. While Alan is speaking to Charlie's ashes and trying to decide where to spread them, Walden appears from nowhere on the back deck, scaring Alan and causing him to drop the ashes across the living room floor. Once inside, he reveals that he was trying to drown himself in the ocean, having been recently divorced from his wife Bridget, portrayed by [[Judy Greer]]. He and Alan bond at Pavlov's bar, where he tells Alan that he made his $1.3 billion fortune by selling his website to [[Microsoft]]. After picking up two women and bringing them back to the house, where he sleeps with them, he decides to buy the house.\n\nHis wife describes him as emotionally immature, which upsets him, so, with Alan's help, he returns to his mansion to confront his wife in the hope of reconciling. However, he is sent away after being treated for an electric shock that he received while climbing the front gates of the mansion. Walden gets a second chance when Bridget later decides that she had been too harsh and that he deserves a chance to prove he is not as childish as he was; this chance is quickly ruined by a food fight between Walden and a little girl in the middle of Soup Plantation. Walden eventually invites Alan and Jake to continue living at the house they have been living in for 8 years with him as Walden wants someone around he can trust, and they became best friends. He used to walk around the house naked, and is often barefoot. He drives a [[Fisker Karma]], and asks Evelyn to remodel the house using [[solar power]] and [[wind power]].\n\nWalden starts dating a [[British people|British]] woman named Zoey ([[Sophie Winkleman]]) whom he met at the supermarket. Bridget later comes wanting Walden back but he declines her wanting Zoey instead. She later is seen stalking him where she runs into Rose who says she can help make Walden suffer. Bridget reluctantly goes with her. Walden was introduced with a beard and long, greasy hair, but when he started to get serious with Zoey, he decided to cut his hair and shave. Walden has also matured a great deal by spending time with Alan and dating Zoey. Though he still considers Alan his best friend, he eventually became aware that Alan is a freeloader and now understands what Charlie had to put up with. In season ten, Walden proposes to Zoey but she turns him down, and leaves him for another man. He starts dating Charlie's former stalker Rose, but Zoey tries to reconcile with Walden, telling him she made a mistake. When Walden tells Rose that they're going to have to break up. Rose acts like she is okay with it at first, but after leaving, she sends two ferrets to attack Walden. Rose goes to Zoey's apartment wearing a pregnancy harness and tells Zoey that Walden got her pregnant. Zoey breaks up with Walden for good once more without letting him explain himself.\n\nLater in the season, Walden takes the alias of Sam Wilson and pretends to be a regular, average guy so he can find someone who isn't after his money. Walden meets Kate ([[Brooke D'Orsay]]), and tells her that he lives with billionaire, Alan Harper. Kate invites Walden to be her roommate, and they ultimately start dating. Walden keeps the lie going for several episodes until he wants to help Kate set up a fashion line of clothes she designed. Walden put US$100,000 in Alan's bank account so he can invest in Kate. After Kate goes to New York, Walden decides to confess who he really is. Walden meets Kate in New York and tells her the truth. Kate breaks up with Walden, but forgives him when she realizes he helped make her dream of being a fashion designer come true. Kate and Walden don't get back together, due to Kate staying in New York. On Valentine's Day, Walden and Kate meet up and sleep together. When they realize they can't get back together due to conflicting schedules, the couple agree to see other people.\n\nAlan and Walden get married so Walden can adopt a child and not live alone. The adoption goes through so Alan and Walden divorce and Walden ends up dating their adoption social worker. After the scare from a threatening Charlie Harper, friends Alan and Walden continue to live together in Walden's beach house.\n\n=== Jenny ===\n<!-- Do not change the name to \"Jenny Harper\" until such time as there is evidence that \"Harper\" is her last name. Addition of \"Harper\" requires an inline citation. -->\nJenny<ref name=eonline>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/437676/charlie-sheen-s-daughter-to-be-gay-on-two-and-a-half-men-get-the-details |title=Charlie Sheen's Daughter to Be Gay on Two and a Half Men\u2014Get the Details! |work=Uk.eonline.com |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> ([[Amber Tamblyn]], Season 11; main, season 12; recurring) is the long lost, illegitimate daughter of Charlie Harper. An aspiring actress, Jenny first appears in the premiere episode of season 11, in which she comes to Malibu hoping to reconnect with her dad, though Walden and her uncle Alan tell her he is dead. It is later revealed that she is a lesbian, and some episodes of the eleventh season put emphasis on this, to the point of [[Satire|comedically]] [[Gay stereotyping|portraying]] Jenny as a stereotypical lesbian who is uninterested in serious relationships and is content to have sex with any woman she meets, to the point that she is able to seduce (or \"recruit\") straight women (at one point, Walden claims that he didn't know one of Jenny's one-night-stands, who is his friend, was a lesbian, and Jenny responds \"Neither did she until last week\", insinuating that the woman was straight but Jenny made her gay), among them Walden's own mother. A brief running gag is Walden and Alan trying to keep their dates from meeting Jenny for this exact reason, though later in the series she abandons her promiscuous lifestyle and tries to find a steady lover. After warming up to her, Walden and Alan invite her to move in after she reveals she has nowhere to go. Though she exhibits many of Charlie's personality traits (particularly his sarcasm, alcoholism, and womanizing), Jenny is considerably much nicer and down-to-earth than he was. Thus far, she has formed good relationships with her surviving relatives, Walden, Berta and Walden's friend Barry ([[Clark Duke]]). She and Jake have never met thus far, but she does know he exists and would like to meet him. In \"Welcome Home, Jake\" she meets Barry for the first time, mistaking him for Jake. She happily gives him a hug only to be disgusted when she discovers the truth. She eventually takes a liking to Barry and the two become the best of friends. Though it is apparent that Walden is attracted to her, he believes she has no drive or ambition. Fearing she may turn into \"another Alan\", he tries to be a positive role model for her. Jenny considered Walden the greatest father figure she'd ever had. She moved from her home in [[New York City]] in order to find her dad in Malibu. She apparently has a poor relationship with her mother (like her father did) and the only reason she became an actress was \"to piss her mother off,\" as she wanted her to become a doctor. In the twelfth season, Jenny uses her experience in the LGBT community to help Walden and Alan pose as a gay couple so that they can adopt Louis, and moves out of the beach house so Louis can stay in Jake's room. She makes a brief appearance in the final episode, where she receives a large cheque and an apology letter from Charlie, who survived his accident in Paris. She also appears to have gone back to her promiscuous ways, given that she was apparently having a threesome with two women and forgot they were in her bedroom.\n\nDespite being introduced as the new \"half man\" in the eleventh season, she was replaced in that capacity by another character, Louis for the twelfth and final season. Tamblyn's billing is also demoted to below Conchata Ferrell's, as the role was now recurring rather than regular.\n\n=== Louis ===\nLouis (Edan Alexander, Season 12) is the child whom Walden and Alan foster. Louis and Alan bond almost instantly, whereas he and Walden initially do not bond, but they eventually find a common ground and form a strong father-son relationship. He also takes a liking to Berta and Evelyn as well. Louis' favorite snacks are Cheez-Its, cereal, and pancakes. He is officially adopted by Walden in the third-to-last episode. Notably, Louis is the only main character physically absent in the series finale, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\", this absence not being explained, although a picture of him was shown.\n\n=== Berta ===\nBerta ([[Conchata Ferrell]], Season 1 recurring; Seasons 2\u201312 regular) is the family housekeeper. Although she may be viewed as sarcastic, rude and sometimes outright disrespectful, Alan and Charlie still treat her with enormous respect, partly out of fear, and it is clear that the household cannot function properly without her. Berta has tried her best not to allow the overwhelming stress of her job to get to her head: when the very tidy Alan moved in, she quit and Charlie was so upset that Alan had to personally beg her to return, promising that Alan would do his own cleaning. However, the fact that Jake's bedroom could be confused with a dump (at various times including dead fish in the closet, food left-overs in his toy box, and nasal mucus under the bed), his toilet seat is frequently sprayed with urine, and his underwear is filthy, often leads to anger on her part. Her favorite line after a mini-disaster occurs in the house is, \"I ain't cleaning that up.\" During the Kutcher years of the show her role on screen was increased. Season 11 was the first time she appeared in every single episode of a season.\n\nBerta has a sister named Daisy ([[Camryn Manheim]]), with whom she does not get along. She also has three daughters and several granddaughters, whom she admits are \"sleazy and easy\" and sometimes brings along to work; a notable example was teenage granddaughter Prudence ([[Megan Fox]]). Berta has two ex-husbands; her first marriage lasted 15 years, and her second was a drunken Las Vegas escapade she refers to as \"one hell of a weekend\" which ended when she divorced him in Reno. She has served time in [[prison]] and worked as a prison barber. She uses, and makes references to, drugs (legal and otherwise); it is hinted that she has enjoyed many a joint during work hours and can produce a perfect one given the opportunity. She takes anxiolytics (Valium especially) in her coffee to reduce her violent tendencies. She was a [[groupie]] with the [[Grateful Dead]] and has implied that she had a lesbian experience during that time. While it was hinted several times before Charlie's death that he had changed his will so she'd inherit the beach house instead of Alan, that turned out to be untrue, although Berta was set to move out because the house had mortgages attached that Alan had no chance of paying.\n\nBerta often calls Alan \"Zippy\". She and Alan are portrayed as the only people saddened over Charlie's death. She considered him to be the best boss she ever had. After Walden buys the house, he asks her to remain there as a live-in housekeeper. She agrees, mainly because she is extremely attracted to Walden and would often make discreet advances at him. This living arrangement is short-lived when she finds out that Alan will be moving back in, only this becomes more likely when Walden sees Berta invite a piggish houseguest over. She never thought she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but admits to Walden that he is instead the greatest boss she ever had, making Charlie second-best. Berta hardly ever shows any signs of attraction to Walden after season nine. Despite her displeasure of Jake's presence in the house when he originally moved in, she's far more friendly and welcoming to Louis when he moves in because he's cute and his background is similar to hers. \n\nIn 2014, Ferrell revealed that Berta was originally intended to be an ethnic minority, but producers liked the way Ferrell performed the role. She also revealed that Berta was only intended to be in a two-episode arc of the first season and would leave due to Alan and his kid moving into the beach house, but producers extended the role and eventually made her a main cast member from season 2 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/conchata-ferrell-two-and-half-men-and-her-crusty-b-210339|title=Conchata Ferrell on Two And A Half Men and her \"crusty but benign\" career|first=Will|last=Harris|date=|website=avclub.com}}</ref> In the final episode, Berta gets a large check from Charlie and seems to retire to Walden's beach house.\n\n=== Evelyn Harper ===\n'''Evelyn Pepper''' (previously '''Harper, Gorsky, Thomas, King and Leopold'''; [[Holland Taylor]], Seasons 1\u20139 regular; Seasons 10\u201312 recurring) is Charlie and Alan's mother and Jake and Jenny's grandmother. In the first season, she is 58 years old; out of vanity, she changes the year of her birth as she ages. She expresses a superficial fondness for her sons and grandson, but she rarely lives up to her self-perceived notion of being a devoted and misunderstood [[Matriarchy|matriarch]]. Her sons and grandson generally return the favor and go out of their way to avoid interacting with her on most occasions. Her wide-ranging sex life is a recurring gag throughout the series  as she is attracted to both men and women. In addition to [[#Teddy Leopold|Teddy]] who was not actually \"[[#Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman|Courtney]]\"'s father, Evelyn has been sexually involved with several parents of her sons' lovers and friends, including [[#Rose|Rose]]'s father, Gloria's mother, Gloria's presumed father, Gloria's likely biological father (i.e., the boys' father, Frank Harper), Walden's mother (with whom Charlie's daughter, Jenny, had already had sex),<ref>Jenny and Robin shared a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] with [[Lynda Carter]]; Evelyn and Robin subsequently did so with [[Michael Bolton]].</ref> and Lyndsey's mother. She also bedded Charlie's ex-girlfriend Jill who had become Bill, and [[Walden Schmidt|Walden]]. Evelyn has been widowed five times, her fifth marriage being the shortest as he died an hour after saying their vows.\n\nThe family frequently refers to her as \"the devil\" (or, as Charlie put it, \"unholy mother of us\"), and Charlie has her number on speed-dial in his cell phone as \"[[Number of the Beast|666]].\" Once, she showed up at the door in a black cloak while carrying a scythe. When Alan asked who it was, Charlie responded \"It's Death,\" to which Alan replied, \"Hi, mom!\" It has been implied on one occasion that she is ''literally'' a witch (who is dreaded and feared by other witches) \u2013 one of Charlie's girls was a worshipper of the Devil, and was scared away by Evelyn. Wealthy, with a luxurious house in [[Beverly Hills]], she has been married numerous times and sells [[Real estate agent|real estate]]. When Charlie died, surprisingly, she was distraught over his death. At his funeral, however, she continuously mentions her intention to sell his house ''while'' Alan was giving his eulogy. Her relationship with Alan has somewhat gotten better since Charlie's death, as she has acknowledged that he is not just her second-born son, he is now the only son she has left, as well. When Alan almost died from a heart attack, she feared for his life, because not only did she not want to lose another child, her \"good son\" was already deceased.\n\nTwo years after Charlie's death, she finally meets her long lost granddaughter Jenny. Surprisingly, Evelyn embraces her newfound grandchild and completely disowns Jake; she had previously said she would have enjoyed a relationship with Jake, but \"got to him\" too late for proper bonding. In the eleventh season she marries for the sixth time, this time to her much older lover, Marty Pepper.\n\nShe rarely appeared during season nine, but was prominent in the last few episodes of the season. Despite still credited and billed as a main character, Evelyn only made one appearance in the tenth season and several appearances in season eleven. In the final season she shows up at Alan and Walden's wedding followed by sleeping with \"Michael Bolton\" and Walden's mother Robin then also has sex with a fake Santa Claus and in the last episode when Alan needs Charlie's death certificate and she gets threatening message from Charlie.\n\n=== Judith Harper-Melnick ===\nJudith Harper-Melnick ([[Marin Hinkle]], Seasons 1\u20139 regular; Seasons 10\u201312 guest) is Alan's cheating, vindictive, cold hearted, self-absorbed, and humorless first wife. She seems to despise Alan and takes any chance to humiliate him. She was the first woman Alan ever slept with, but their marriage was cold: according to her, the only time she was ever happy being sexual was when she was pregnant with Jake. In the pilot, she lied to him about realizing she was homosexual as an excuse to end the marriage, and in subsequent episode he caught her picking up multiple men. She made no secret of living luxuriously with Alan's [[alimony]], seeing as she has not held a job since she divorced him. She has since remarried to Dr. Herbert \"Herb\" Melnick ([[Ryan Stiles]]), Jake's pediatrician, a union that brought joy to Alan because it meant he no longer had to pay alimony.\n\nIn season six, she threw Herb out of the house and briefly reunited with Alan before reconciling with Herb, and it was later revealed she was pregnant with a daughter, whom she eventually named Millie. Alan hoped he was the father, but Judith said she would kill him if he revealed that he slept with her, and after she gave birth in the sixth-season finale, the child's parentage remained uncertain, as Judith was with both Herb and Alan around the time Millie was conceived. Jake and Berta describe Millie as looking nothing like Judith or Herb but more like a girl version of Alan, implying Alan is the probable biological father.\n\nIn seasons seven and nine, Judith made very few appearances but was featured in almost every episode in season eight. Unlike her relationship with Charlie, Judith got along with Walden just fine \u2013 mostly due to her initial interest in him. She was not seen since the season nine finale until towards the end of season ten, with only being briefly mentioned for most of the season. In the episode \"Run, Steven Staven! Run!\", Judith's absence is finally explained when Herb mentions that Judith moved out when he cheated on her with his receptionist (yet in season 11, she is shown to still be living there). However, in the 19th episode of season ten, she reappears after a long absence when Herb starts to go crazy. Walden and Alan call her to go to Herb's hotel room and take him back.\n\nShe plays a major role in the season eleven episode \"Cab Fare and a Bottle of Penicillin\", when Alan showed up at her house just to talk about old times and after a night of drinking they end up engaged. However, in the end, Judith ends the engagement after Walden explains to her that Alan had proposed to Lindsey the same night he proposed to her (however he did not explain that she didn't accept Alan's proposal as she is now engaged to Larry). Angered by this, she kicks Alan in the groin. It is unknown if she and Herb have officially divorced or are just separated. In the final episode, Alan calls her thinking that Charlie is going to kill him and he tells her that she was his only true love. She tells him she has another call and hangs up on him.\n\n=== Rose ===\nRose ([[Melanie Lynskey]], Seasons 1\u20132 regular; Seasons 3\u201312 recurring) is the Harpers' wealthy neighbor and Charlie's stalker and after his death, she finds new love and a stalker victim in Walden. She was one of Charlie's one-night stands who won't allow him to forget about her as he does all his other sexual conquests. Rose acknowledges that she is \"boundary challenged\", while Charlie and Alan refer to her as Charlie's stalker. In the pilot, she told Alan that she sneaks into Charlie's room while he's asleep and tries on his underwear. Usually uninvited, she enters and exits Charlie's house by climbing onto the backyard deck, rather than using the front door. She has been caught by Charlie and Alan as she has watched them while sleeping on several occasions. While credited among the main cast in CBS press releases in Season 3\u20134, she was credited as a recurring star in on-screen credits.<ref name=\"S3S4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20060821cbs06 |title=Listings &#124; TheFutonCritic.com |work=TheFutonCritic.com |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> After season 4, she left for London and appeared on the show only rarely. She later returns to Malibu in Season 5, though no longer living next door to Charlie, hence her less frequent appearances. She claims she was sent away from England after \"an incident at Buckingham Palace.\" In Season 6, she became friends with Charlie's fianc\u00e9e Chelsea and went on a blind date with Alan; the two began dating before Rose evinced the same jealousy and possessiveness towards Alan that she had applied towards Charlie, right down to gluing things to his genitals. Although she is somewhat mentally unhinged and obsessed with Charlie, Rose expressed that she \"has an undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] (which she completed in 2 years) and a [[master's degree]] in [[behavioral psychology]] from [[Stanford University]].\" Throughout the series, Rose has applied her knowledge of interpersonal communication towards the various situations that arise. Her family is involved in banking and oil, making them, and implicitly her, extremely wealthy. [[Martin Sheen]], who is Charlie Sheen's real-life father, made a guest-appearance on the show as Rose's equally-disturbed father, Harvey, who similarly obsessed over Evelyn after sleeping with her once. Rose's paternal grandparents were first cousins, to which her grandmother attributes Rose's and Harvey's mental issues. Rose also has five ferrets, all named \"Charlie,\" as was revealed in Season 2's \"The Salmon Under My Sweater.\" Her only appearance in Season 7 was in \"Gumby with a Pokey\" when Charlie begins to hallucinate (after taking medicinal marijuana). Women in his past interrogate why he mistreated them, then he goes out to the deck to discover Rose; unlike the other women, Rose is really there. She made multiple appearances in Season 8, after staging her wedding, which makes Charlie realize he probably loves her. In the last episode of Season 8, Charlie leaves for Paris with her. In Season 9, Rose reveals that she and Charlie got engaged in Paris. It is implied she may have had something to do with Charlie's death after she returned to their Paris hotel to find him showering with another woman. She reappears again at the end of \"What a Lovely Landing Strip\" catching Walden's ex-wife Bridget spying on Walden and his new girlfriend, she then tells her that she can help her in making Walden suffer. She makes a brief cameo through archive footage in a flashback montage in the episode \"Oh Look! Al-Qaeda!\". She returns in Season 10's \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\" now dating Walden, much to Alan's dismay. The relationship gets serious but is short lived when Walden reconciles with Zoey. However, Rose gets revenge by telling Zoey that she is pregnant with Walden's baby. Walden ends up without Zoey or Rose. Rose continues to stalk Walden as well as the Harpers, despite Charlie's death. Rose returns in \"Advantage: Fat, Flying Baby\", at the end where it's discovered that Rose is Walden's girlfriend's new investor for her fashion line. In the series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\", it is revealed that Rose lied about Charlie's death. She did catch him cheating and kept him imprisoned in her basement. However, Charlie escaped and used the royalties from his children's songs to pay back all the people he wronged and threatened Evelyn, Alan and Walden. Rose reveals the truth to them, but is not jailed for the crime. The character has been described as a sociopath although she has a warm and friendly exterior.<ref>http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/repairing-relationships/201202/is-your-partner-sociopath</ref>\n\n=== Kandi ===\nKandi Harper ([[April Bowlby]], Season 3 recurring, Season 4 main, Season 10 guest, Season 12 guest) is Alan's second ex-wife. While credited among the main cast during the fourth season, CBS press releases billed her as a recurring character.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Initially Charlie's gorgeous but dim-witted girlfriend until Charlie broke it off with her so he could date Mia. When Judith (who later became Kandi's confidante) initially tried to end Kandi's relationship with Alan, Kandi's mother Mandi ([[Gail O'Grady]]), who also had a brief fling with Charlie during that time, made sure the couple were dating again. During this time Judith briefly dated Kandi's father Andi ([[Kevin Sorbo]]) leading an interesting joke Jake told his father about the possibility Kandi could be his stepmother, stepsister and stepcousin all at once. Kandi and Alan had a superficial relationship based mostly on sex, but they eventually wed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where they also won half a million dollars. After only four months of marriage, and spending nearly all of their winnings, Kandi kicked Alan out of their condominium, which was later revealed to be because Alan did not want to have another child with her. With Judith's help, Kandi acquires (and [[Attorney misconduct|seduces]]) Judith's lawyer from her divorce and, despite only being married to him four months, manages to claim alimony payments from Alan, making him all the poorer and dependent on Charlie. Kandi is soon offered a role as a forensics expert on a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-type television series, entitled ''Stiffs''. At the same time, Alan sees that Jake is practically grown up and he returns to Kandi to agree to have a baby with her. However, moments before they try to conceive, Kandi finally signs the divorce papers to ensure that Alan will not have any claim on her new-found television lucre, and disappears from Alan's life. In the tenth season, Kandi resurfaces as a television star and tries to win Alan back, but despite his temptations, Alan ultimately rejects her, as he is in a relationship with Lyndsey McElroy. After a paparazzo acquires [[Photoshop|altered]] photographs of them together, Kandi goes to explain the situation to Lyndsey, and for unknown reasons they end up having sex. \n\nIn the final episode, Kandi has become a celebrity, and is seen being mobbed by photographers. Alan, fearing the wrath of a very-alive Charlie, telephones her to tell her she was the love of his life. She is the only one of Alan's lovers to be genuinely touched by his words, indicating that she may have been the only woman to actually love Alan. \n\nPrior to playing Kandi, Bowlby had appeared as another character named Kimber.\n\n=== Chelsea Melini ===\nChelsea Christine Melini ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Bini Taylor]], Season 6 recurring; Season 7 regular, Season 9 guest, Season 12 guest) is Charlie's girlfriend for most of season six, who has moved into his house by the season's end. Formerly a [[one-night stand]], Chelsea seems to be one of the few women out of Charlie's countless relationships that has caused him to try to make positive changes in his debaucherous lifestyle. She became close friends with Alan, something Charlie enjoyed because Alan could take her to museums and foreign films (activities that Charlie cannot stand). In the seventh season premiere, Charlie finally decides to let go of Mia and commit to Chelsea. As the season progresses they plan to marry but, after Chelsea becomes attracted to Alan's lawyer and Charlie vomits on a baby, Chelsea postpones the wedding. In Season 7 Charlie and Chelsea make several attempts to reconcile, most recently following her breakup with Brad (the man Chelsea left Charlie for). Chelsea tried to reunite with Charlie, but was thwarted due to her best friend, Gail ([[Tricia Helfer]]), sleeping with him. Jake later gives Chelsea a necklace that Charlie got her for her birthday and she goes outside to see him but when she got there, Charlie was in trouble with the police for rear ending a police car, with a suspended license. Jake was driving at the beginning of this episode, but when the police came after them in a cop car, Jake and Charlie switched seats, causing Charlie to lose his license. While credited among the main cast as Jennifer Taylor during the seventh season, CBS press releases bill her as a recurring character. At Charlie's funeral, she says he gave her [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]. She appears in the [[Of Course He's Dead|finale]] with a huge check from Charlie and an apology letter for shooting her while they were dating. \n\nBini Taylor previously appeared in the pilot episode as woman in the grocery store aisle complimenting Charlie and Jake, and again in Season 2 as Tina, one of the women Charlie apologises to as he tries to find out who set up the 'Charlie Harper Sucks' website.\n\n== Recurring  characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 7)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 8)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 10)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 11)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Herb Melnick|Herb Melnick]]\n| [[Ryan Stiles]]\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"1\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"5\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Dr. Linda Freeman|Dr. Linda Freeman]]\n| [[Jane Lynch]]\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"7\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"1\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" | \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Mia|Mia]]\n| [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"2\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"3\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"2\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Gordon|Gordon]]\n| [[J.

Well mannered and intelligent, Ava adored Walden, and is 108th [[Line of succession to the British throne|in line to the throne]].<ref>Ava's father, Nigel Pierce, counters Zoey's mention of Walden being a billionaire in episode 9.15 by noting that he [Nigel] is 107th in line to the throne.</ref> Ava invites Walden to her birthday during season ten, despite her mother having broken up with him.\n\n=== Billy Stanhope ===\nBilly Stanhope ([[Patton Oswalt]], season 9\u201310), Walden's business partner and frenemy. Walden and Billy have a love-and-hate relationship, and even though they don't realize it, they're probably best friends. In season nine, after years of not speaking to each other, Walden and Billy start their business back up again and work together on a project they call the \"electronic suitcase\". In Billy's next appearance, he reveals that he has been seeing Walden's ex-wife, Bridget. Walden and Billy sell the electronic suitcase in season ten for $1.2 billion. In mid-season ten, Bridget breaks up with Billy, resulting in Walden, Alan, Billy, and Herb having a guys' night out, drinking and complaining about women. He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Bridget Schmidt ===\nBridget Schmidt ([[Judy Greer]], season 9\u201310, season 12), the ex-wife of Walden Schmidt. She initiated the divorce proceedings because she felt Walden would never become a mature adult, but after the divorce was ready to be finalized she decided she loved him anew and wanted him back. Unfortunately, Walden decided to sign the divorce papers and continue his nascent relationship with Zoey, leading Bridget to become violently unhinged and to fall into the orbit of a returned-from-Paris Rose.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=People Who Love Peepholes|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 9)#ep179|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|airdate=September 26, 2011|season=9|number=2}}</ref> This is later proven to be a one-off gag for that particular episode as Bridget later started dating Walden's business partner, Billy, at the end of season nine, but she left him in \"Run, Steven Staven! Run!\". Bridget makes an appearance in the series finale \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\" in which she talks to Walden on the phone while in bed with actor [[John Stamos]], who previously appeared in \"[[Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt]]\" (Walden's debut episode).\n\nIn Season 4, Greer portrayed the role of Myra Melnick the sister of [[#Herb Melnick|Herb Melnick]], Judith's fianc\u00e9/husband, in the episodes \"[[Two and a Half Men (season 4)#ep91|Smooth as a Ken Doll]]\" and \"[[Two and a Half Men (season 4)#ep92|Aunt Myra Doesn't Pee a Lot]]\", during which she had a brief swing with Charlie before she returned home to her [[fianc\u00e9]], whose existence came as a shock to Charlie.\n\n=== Celeste ===\nCeleste ([[Tinashe Kachingwe]], seasons 6\u20137), Jake's ex-girlfriend, and main love interest of seasons six and seven. Jake first meets Celeste when she and her dad, Jerome, move in next door to Charlie. Jake and Celeste secretly date at first because her father is over protective, but he eventually gives the couple his blessing. Celeste shows to be controlling over Jake, but he doesn't seem to notice. In season seven, Celeste spends Christmas with her mother, so Charlie convinces Jake to cheat on Celeste. Celeste stops by Charlie's house to give Jake his Christmas present, but when she sees that he is cheating on her, she breaks up with him. Jake tries to get Celeste back in the following episode, but has no luck.\n\n=== Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman ===\nCourtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman ([[Jenny McCarthy]], seasons 5, 8\u20139), Charlie's girlfriend for a multi-episode thread. Charlie falls for \"Courtney\", whom he believes is the daughter of Evelyn's fianc\u00e9, and lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes shortly before they are to become step-siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart-broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia Fishman, but he retains feelings for her, telling her that he will \"wait\" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's \"Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\" after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her. The two break up two episodes later in \"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead\" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. In the season 9 episode \"Nine Magic Fingers\", Courtney starts dating Walden, but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget successfully convince Walden that Courtney is a con artist.\n\n=== Dr. Linda Freeman ===\nDr. Linda Freeman ([[Jane Lynch]], seasons 1, 3\u20139, 11), initially as Jake's, then as Charlie's and occasionally Alan's adept, incisive but money-hungry psychiatrist. Often when Charlie or Alan are just getting to the root of their problem, Dr. Freeman notes that the area is interesting, \"but, unfortunately, we're out of time\". She prides herself as a guesser and is quite sarcastic, especially with Charlie. A recurring gag is her frequent over-billing, once charging Charlie a full hour's fee ($200) for 5 minutes of consultation, and on another occasion while treating Alan for insomnia she billed him for an entire hour after he slept for 40 minutes of the session pointing out that ''she'' was awake. In one episode, she tells Charlie to open up and not hold anything back as her hourly fee comes to \"$7 a minute\". During her sessions with Jake, Dr. Freeman displays a rather quirky demeanor and is noted for her use of a cow hand puppet. She later has a session with Walden in season 9. It is implied that she (like her actress) is [[bisexual]], as after Walden hugs her, she remarks \"Hmph. Maybe I'm ''not'' gay.\" <ref>Season 9 episode \"The Squat and Hover\"</ref>\n\n=== Barry Foster ===\nBarry Foster ([[Clark Duke]], seasons 11\u201312), was the working partner of Walden's love interest at the time Nicole. He is a full grown man but due to his youthful looks, childish personality, and short stature \u2013 he is often mistaken to be a kid. After Nicole left Malibu to work for Google in San Francisco, Barry was left homeless and without a job. He moves in with Walden temporarily, until Walden decides he's had enough of people moving into his house so he found Barry an apartment. Barry idolizes Walden to the point it's borderline obsession. Nevertheless, Walden takes a liking to Barry and the two become good friends. Despite having his own place, Barry tends to spend most of his time at the beach house hanging out with Jenny (the two become best friends of sorts and are seen as a sort of a double act \u2013 similar to Jake and Eldridge), or eating their food. Jenny, Alan and Berta mistook him for Jake upon meeting him for the first time. Since his first appearance on the show, Barry's role gradually becomes more significant. Barry only makes one appearance in season 12. He is there when the birth mother of Walden and Alan's supposed child goes into labour and stays to be there with them. He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Eldridge McElroy ===\nEldridge McElroy ([[Graham Patrick Martin]], seasons 7\u20139), Jake's best friend whose mother Lyndsey ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]) dated Alan. Eldridge is a dim-witted drummer and somewhat of a troublemaker. In his first appearance at the end of season 7, he and Jake get into trouble after sneaking off to the beach with \"a few\" beers. Jake and Eldridge are often portrayed reinforcing one another's stupidity, and by season 9, have become chronic [[cannabis culture|stoners]]. While Jake and Eldridge are friends, the relationship between their parents briefly causes some friction, but their friendship survives and they decide to join the Army following their high school graduation. Eldridge is never seen or mentioned again by name after season 10 (where Jake mentions while talking to Alan about them talking about Lyndsey and his relationship), though in season 12, a drunk Lyndsey does make reference to her and Alan both having screwed-up kids.\n\n=== Ms. McMartin ===\nMs. McMartin ([[Maggie Lawson]], season 12), is the social worker who places Louis into Walden and Alan's care in the final season, when they get married in order to fool the system into adopting a child for Walden. Walden has an attraction to her which he finds hard to bury as he needs to act gay in order to successfully adopt. Eventually, Alan and Ms. McMartin copulate, but when Alan reunites with Lyndsey, Walden and Ms. McMartin sleep together. Though they initially decide to go their separate ways as they believed the romance was just in the heat of the moment and they weren't truly a thing, Walden decides he doesn't want to be alone forever and that he truly love Ms. McMartin. He then goes to ask for another chance, and after serenading her with [[Michael Bolton]], she accepts. While Alan once asked Ms. McMartin what her first name is, her response is not shown to the audience.  To show respect in Louis' presence, Alan and Walden continue to refer to her as Ms. McMartin.\n\n=== Gordon ===\nGordon ([[J.D. Walsh (actor)|J.D. Walsh]], seasons 1\u20134, 6\u20138), a pizza delivery driver who idolized Charlie. During the third season he has a brief relationship with Rose, who forces him to dress like Charlie and yell the latter's name during sex. After their break-up, he disappears from the show, but returned in season six, again delivering pizzas. He revealed how he became a millionaire on the stock market, got married and subsequently divorced and then lost all his money to his ex-wife, forcing him to return to pizza delivery. He looked up to Charlie, often calling him a genius and always addressing him as \"Mr. Harper\" rather than the more familiar \"Charlie\".  Charlie invariably orders pizza from Gordon's pizzeria for him to deliver, irrespective of the distance; including when subletting his own live-in girlfriend Chelsea's old apartment in the San Fernando Valley,<ref>Episode 6.22 \"Sir Lancelot's Litter Box\"</ref> and when camped out with Alan ''et al.'' in Lyndsey's burned-out house<ref>Episode 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\"</ref> twenty miles from the beach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Gordon is unaware that Alan briefly dated Rose after his own relationship with her.<ref>When Charlie introduces Gordon to Alan's ex-wife's new husband Herb and Alan's girlfriend's ex-husband Chris in ep. 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\" Gordon mistakenly offers that he has not had sex with anyone in Alan's life.</ref> Since he never appeared again after Season 8, it will always remain unknown if he knows that Charlie had gone missing.\n\n=== Herb Melnick ===\nDr. Herbert \"Herb\" Melnick ([[Ryan Stiles]], season 2, 4\u201310, 12) portrays Judith's goofy, train-hobbyist, pediatrician second husband and Jake's stepfather. He first appeared as Judith's date in Season 2's \"Enjoy Those Garlic Balls,\" but due to an inconsistency in the storyline, he was initially referred to as \"Greg Melnick.\" Not particularly happily married to uptight Judith, he is laid-back and gets along with the Harper brothers, whose lifestyles he appears to envy at times\u2014such as Charlie's partying and the fact that Alan was married to Kandi and later dates neighborhood MILF (and former soft-core porn actress) Lyndsey McElroy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Episode 8.1, \"Three Girls and a Guy Named Bud\"</ref> He finally achieves his dream of dating Lyndsey in the twelfth season.<ref>Episode 12.9 \"Bouncy, Bouncy, Bouncy, Lyndsey\"</ref> He and the other men in Judith's neighborhood similarly idolize Lyndsey's ex-husband Chris for repeatedly seducing the babysitter.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Episode 8.4, \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\"</ref> He has stated that he likes spending time with the Harpers, and called Charlie \"a little loosie-goosie with the liquor and the ladies, but all-in-all a good fella\" (which did not impress Judith). In the Season 6 finale, Judith gives birth to their daughter, whom they name Millie Melnick. However, Herb does not know that Judith had a brief affair with Alan around the time Millie was conceived, and remains in the dark about the fact that Alan could possibly be Millie's biological father. Single for most of his life, Herb's hobbies center on gardening,<ref name=\"Episode 5.13 The Soil is Moist\">Episode 5.13 \"The Soil is Moist\"</ref> his large model train layout,<ref>Episode 6.7 \"Best H.O. Money Can Buy\"</ref> and \"accidentally\" bumping into Lyndsey every morning.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Sexually, he is particularly adept at cunnilingus.<ref name=\"Episode 5.13 The Soil is Moist\"/> In season ten, Herb has an affair with his receptionist and Judith leaves him; he keeps the house (Alan's former house). After she leaves him Alan lives with him briefly after he and Walden have a fight, but tries to keep Alan as he is lonely without Judith. He begins to party out of control to get over Judith, so Walden and Alan call Judith to try and calm him down (a rare moment of Alan and Judith working together). Herb and Judith then reluctantly get back together and Herb returns to normalcy.\n\nHerb does not make a single appearance in Season 11. In the episode \"Cab Fare and a Bottle of Pencillin\", it is implied that he and Judith have separated for a third time and have possibly divorced, as he is nowhere to be seen at his and Judith's house. He returns in season 12 when Walden calls him, Barry and Larry over to celebrate that he and Alan will be adopting a child. He is there with Walden and Alan when the birth mother goes into labour and decides to stay with them because he wanted to be there to support them. Notably, Herb does not appear in the series finale, nor is there any mention of him.\n\n=== Judge Linda Harris ===\nJudge Linda Harris ([[Ming-Na Wen]], season 5), Charlie's main love interest of the fifth season. Charlie and Linda met through Alan, and his girlfriend Donna. Charlie and Linda's first date doesn't go as planned, but Charlie gets himself arrested in order to see Linda at court.

Charlie flies to London to see Rose, but when he learns that Rose is ready to start a family, Charlies flees London and continues his relationship with Linda. Charlie learns that he is good with kids when he meets Linda's son, Brandon. Charlie makes Brandon a mix tape of kid's songs, and when Linda's ex-husband hears them, he offers Charlie a job as a kid's singer. When Linda is awarded as \"Judge of the Year\", she takes Charlie to a function that celebrates her. Evelyn accidentally gives Charlie the wrong pill that instead of calming him down, it makes him act crazy. After being humiliated at the function, Linda breaks up with Charlie.\n\n=== Kate ===\nKate ([[Brooke D'Orsay]], season 10\u201311), Walden's ex-girlfriend and main love interest of season ten. Walden decides he wants to come up with a new persona so he can meet a girl who isn't after his money. Walden pretends to be the make believe Sam Wilson. Walden and Kate meet at the department store where she works. Walden (as \"Sam\") and Kate go on a few dates and Kate meets Alan, \"Sam's\" landlord and she hates him. Kate tells Walden that he can move in with her and he agrees. They also spend Christmas together. Walden has Alan invest in Kate's fashion line with Walden's money and Kate goes to New York to host her fashion show. Walden feels depressed with Kate gone and he gains a lot of weight. Alan helps Walden lose it and they fly to New York so Walden can tell Kate who he is. Kate gets furious and breaks up with him but later realizes that Walden helped her get her fashion show so she forgives him but they remain broken up since Kate has to stay in New York. Kate returns three episodes later and Walden spends Valentine's Day with her. They are forced to break up due to their busy schedules. It is revealed to the audience that Rose is Kate's new fashion line investor (Walden and Alan are ignorant of Rose's involvement, and Kate is unaware of Rose's connection to them and her psychosis). She returns in the season 11 episode \"West Side Story\" inviting Walden to her boutique opening. They then have dinner in the restaurant where they had their first date agreeing not to have sex afterwards, but they end up in bed and right when they are about to have sex, they both get food poisoning from the fish they ate at the restaurant. In the following episode \"Lan Mao Shi Zai Wuding Shang\", Kate goes to San Francisco for a few days and Walden was planning on proposing to her when she got back. He then meets a woman named Vivian and falls for her. He tells Kate when she gets back and they break up for good. She is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Larry Martin ===\nLarry Martin ([[D. B. Sweeney]], season 11\u201312), was Lyndsey's boyfriend after she and Alan broke up. However Lyndsey began cheating on Larry with Alan because he was apparently bad in bed. Alan thinks that he and Lyndsey will get back together, but Lyndsey says she likes all the qualities Larry has that Alan doesn't and therefore only wants the relationship with Alan to be sexual. To find out more about Larry, Alan created a pseudonym of \"Jeff Strongman\". Larry and \"Jeff\" hit it off and eventually become best friends. Larry attends a gym and helps out with charities, but he is very naive and later on develops into an \"idiot\" character. He has a sister, Gretchen ([[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]]), whom he sets up with Jeff. He proposes to Lyndsey halfway through the season just as Alan was about to. Lyndsey says yes to Larry and Larry asks Jeff to be his best man, much to the chagrin of Lyndsey who is irritated by Alan's close friendship with Larry. Larry seems to have no shame as he doesn't mind listening to Jeff and his sister having sex in the next room. It can be argued that he is the most important recurring character in the eleventh season, as the overarching storyline for the season revolves around his relationships with Alan and Lyndsey. When Alan reveals who he truly is to Larry, he initially struggles to understand. When the realization hits him, Larry cancels his wedding with Lyndsey. He attends Alan and Gretchen's wedding, making it clear that he blames Lyndsey not Alan. However, when Walden accidentally reveals to him that Alan was cheating with Lyndsey, Larry goes to confront Alan, only for Walden to push Larry off of the deck of the beach house. He returns in the season 12 episode \"Thirty-Eight, Sixty-Two, Thirty-Eight\", surprisingly still good friends with Alan and Walden. Walden calls him, Herb and Barry over to celebrate the fact that he and Alan will be receiving a child. However, he is confused by that fact and believes that one of the two men will be having the baby. He is there with them when the birth mother goes into labour as he wanted to be there with them, saying \"to raise a child it takes the Village People\". He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Lyndsey McElroy ===\nLyndsey McElroy ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]], season 7\u201312), Alan's on-again/off-again girlfriend in the later seasons, the mother of Jake's best friend, Eldridge ([[Graham Patrick Martin]]), and \u2013 to her extreme consternation \u2013 the daughter of Evelyn's lover, Jean ([[Georgia Engel]]). Years ago, she was featured in a soft-core porn movie, ''Cinnamon's Buns''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> She and Eldridge live in the San Fernando Valley, across the street from Judith, Herb, Jake, and Millie.<ref>Episode 8.4, \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\".</ref> She divorced her husband Chris after discovering his affair with their babysitter.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Alan began dating Lyndsey at the end of season 7, and their relationship was initially kept a secret from their sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/02/courtney-thorne-smith-woos-one-of-two-and-a-half-men.html|title=Courtney Thorne-Smith woos one of 'Two and a Half Men'|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223044804/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/02/courtney-thorne-smith-woos-one-of-two-and-a-half-men.html|archivedate=2010-02-23}}</ref> They have since had several breakups and reunions. In the Season 9 episode \"One False Move, Zimbabwe!\", Alan says Lyndsey is dating someone else, a fact later confirmed when he meets her very young (and rich, and handsome) boyfriend and is misled into thinking he could reunite with her. However, Lyndsey later breaks up with the boyfriend and tells Alan she wants to resume dating him; he is initially happy, then somewhat downcast when she explains that she had to work too hard to look sexy and cover up her bodily functions to keep the young guy, and she can forget about all that with Alan because he's not going to find anyone else. Alan later tells Jake that he and Lyndsey are dating but have absolutely no intention of getting married. They however get engaged in the season ten episode \"Something My Gynecologist Said\". This does not deter Lyndsey from having sex with Alan's ex-wife Kandi when Kandi attempts to reconcile with Alan. Later, in season ten, Lyndsey breaks up with Alan again and begins dating a man named Nick. Nick is unseen, though Alan spies on him and Lyndsey and hears them having loud sex. As season eleven begins, it is unknown what happened to Nick, but Lyndsey reveals she is dating another man who turns out to be Larry Martin. She still keeps Alan around for sex only, revealing that Larry is lousy in bed but that she likes all of his other qualities. Larry eventually proposes to Lyndsey and she accepts, but the wedding is cancelled when Larry learns of Alan's true identity and that Lyndsey cheated. Lyndsey returns early in season twelve after 60 days in alcohol rehab, only to find out that Alan married Walden. She immediately gets drunk and goes to Alan, suggesting that they resume their sex-only relationship. In the last few episodes, she is planning on moving away until she gets back together with Alan and accepts his marriage proposal after seeing the huge engagement ring that Walden purchased for Alan to give to Lyndsey. In the final episode, Alan telephones Lyndsey to inform her that should anything happen to him, she was the love of his life (since he currently fears the wrath of a very-alive Charlie). Though she tells him she loves him, she is in a pawn shop selling Alan's engagement ring behind his back.\n\n=== Megan ===\nMegan ([[Macey Cruthird]], seasons 8\u20139), Jake's math tutor and brief girlfriend. Jake develops a crush on Megan in season eight, but she does not reciprocate the feelings. In season nine, Megan falls for Walden which makes Jake jealous. After realizing she has no chance with Walden, she settles for Jake and they start dating. When Alan is sent to a mental hospital, he has a nightmare that Jake gets Megan pregnant but in reality, Jake reveals that he and Megan never had sex, but he plans to that evening. It is assumed they broke up as Jake had sex with an older woman in \"Not In My Mouth!\"\n\n=== Melissa ===\nMelissa ([[Kelly Stables]], seasons 6\u20138), Alan's receptionist who briefly dated Charlie before starting a relationship with Alan. She broke off the relationship after discovering Alan in bed with her mother (Alan was under the influence of marijuana, provided by Melissa's mother). The two reconcile and begin dating again, but Alan's cheapness and lack of a private area for them to make love causes a second breakup. She reappeared in Alan's life in the second episode of season 8 (\"A Bottle of Wine and a Jackhammer\"), complicating Alan's relationship with Lyndsey. Alan and she had a bad breakup and she violently forced Charlie to reveal Alan's location with Lyndsey, but she never showed up there, wasn't a factor in Alan and Lyndsey's breakup at the time, and has not been seen since. She was mentioned in \"A Giant Cat Holding a Churro\" when Alan was sharing his secrets with Lyndsey, saying he \"cheated on her with an old girlfriend.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/two-and-a-half-men/episodes/season_8/a-bottle-of-wine-and-a-jackhammer |title=Two and a Half Men Season 8 Episode 2 |publisher=TV Fanatic |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mia ===\nMia ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], season 3 recurring, seasons 5\u20137, 9, 12), a ballet teacher whom Charlie Harper fell in love with during the [[Two and a Half Men (season 3)|third season]]. She got him to clean up his act by not drinking or smoking as much, not wearing bowling shirts as well as not eating meat. However, he breaks up with her after he becomes fed up with the way she was trying to control his behavior. She then takes a job in [[New York City]]. She returns towards the end of the third season when her dancing group comes to town, and she asks Charlie for his sperm so she can have a baby. He attempts but fails, and he then proposes marriage to her, in which she accepts. Initially, Alan was their wedding planner, however after a big blowout with Mia's parents, they agree to go to Las Vegas and elope. Just as they are about to be married, Mia implies that Alan and Jake will be moving out after they wed, and Charlie refuses to throw out his family. They break off the engagement and she leaves. Mia returns in the fifth season when Charlie sees that she is marrying another man, and he attempts to win her back, but her father punches him out. She returns again the sixth and seventh seasons after her divorce in hopes that Charlie will help her with a new-found singing career. She's a terrible singer. Charlie then has to choose between Mia and his then-fianc\u00e9e Chelsea. After much consideration, Charlie chooses Chelsea and abandons Mia at the recording studio. Mia also makes a brief guest appearance in the ninth season premi\u00e8re at Charlie's funeral. In the final episode, Mia gets a letter of apology from Charlie for having an affair with her sister, along with a large check. When she sees the amount, she says \"Screw my sister\", presumably forgiving him.\n\n=== Robin Schmidt ===\nRobin Schmidt ([[Mimi Rogers]], season 9\u201312), the [[primatologist]] mother of Walden Schmidt. Robin is on the board of directors at Walden's company along with Walden, Bridget, and later Alan. Robin raised Walden from birth until he was four with a baby gorilla to study the differences of the growth between humans and monkeys. Walden spends Christmas in season nine with Robin. Robin is quite wealthy and has a good relationship with both Bridget and Zoey. Robin teamed up with Bridget to get Walden kicked off the board of directors because she felt he was using money irresponsibly (Even going so far as to give Alan a \"[[handjob|happy ending]]\" in the men's room of a bar to accomplish this). In season 11 she appeared at a fund-raiser with [[Lynda Carter]], and at the end of the episode it is implied she had a threesome with Jenny and Lynda. A similar scenario occurs after her sons' wedding, where she winds up having a threesome with Michael Bolton and Evelyn Harper.\n\n=== Teddy Leopold/Nathan Krunk ===\nTeddy Leopold/Nathan Krunk ([[Robert Wagner]], seasons 4\u20135), Evelyn's fianc\u00e9, thought to be the father of Courtney.

Teddy first appears in the season four finale and maintains a recurring role halfway through season five where he and Evelyn become engaged and married. On their wedding day, right after being married, Teddy is found with his pants down, dead on Charlie's bed. It appears Courtney wasn't his daughter but his partner; their real names were Nathan Krunk and Sylvia Fishman. Teddy is Evelyn's fifth deceased husband, although their marriage was not consummated before he widowed her. His [[catchphrase]] was, \"terrific\".\n\n=== Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce ===\nZoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce ([[Sophie Winkleman]], seasons 9\u201310), the British girlfriend of Walden Schmidt up until the second episode of season 10.

In the season ten episode \"Ferrets, Attack!\", Zoey attempts to reconcile with Walden but she finds out he has moved in with Rose; in truth Rose moved her things into Walden's house without permission. Walden leaves Rose for Zoey, but Zoey no longer wants him as she is mad that he and Rose became serious. She has not been seen since and only briefly mentioned twice. In the final episode, Walden calls Zoey and discovers she has married well and is being crowned Queen of Moldavia.\n\n=== Marty Pepper ===\nMarty Pepper ([[Carl Reiner]], seasons 7\u20138, 11), Evelyn's much older boyfriend, a retired TV producer. Evelyn first invites him round to Charlie's house when she goes to visit. He believes Alan and Charlie to be gay and Jake to be their adopted son, which he quips would make a great sitcom. This becomes the premise of season 12 of the show with Alan and Walden marrying to adopt a child. He gives the boys advice on how to score with women, telling them to say to a woman that he will give her, her own sitcom. He reappeared in season 11 in multiple episodes. He meets Evelyn's newly found granddaughter but does not like her living with them when Walden throws her out of his house as she is receiving all of Evelyn's attention, leaving no time for sex between them. He initially mistakes Evelyn inviting Jenny to stay as a sexual reason as he had never done a grandmother/grandchild combination before. He believes Walden and Alan to be gay and ask the minister to marry them at his and Evelyn's wedding. He puts Walden and Alan in charge of his stag party, but it ends in disaster and he breaks off the engagement as he does not want to be tied down, but he eventually resumes the marriage and becomes Evelyn's sixth husband with Walden and Alan as his best men. He believes Walden to be one of Evelyn's sons and prefers him over Alan, as most people do. He and Evelyn reportedly have an \"open marriage\", in that they can sleep with other people, as Evelyn does on at least 2 occasions following the wedding. In his original appearance (\"Warning, It's Dirty\") the character was slightly different, he spoke with a slight lisp and out of one side of his mouth.

Charlie spent his days partying, sleeping, gambling, drinking alcohol, womanizing and wearing bowling shirts. He had many major serious romantic relationships, one was with his [[Stalking|stalker]], Rose, a ballerina and dance teacher named Mia and Chelsea.  He was the opposite of Alan: [[wealth]]y, confident, and charismatic. He gave his nephew, Jake, advice (much of which is not age-appropriate), but the two increasingly traded barbs as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dimewars.com/Blog/Charlie-Sheen-Abruptly-Quits--Two-And-A-Half-Men--With-No-Remorse.aspx?BlogID=a8e449d1-240c-4ddf-b728-80124c61647e |title=Charlie Sheen Abruptly Quits 'Two And A Half Men' With No Remorse |publisher=Dimewars.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415205415/http://dimewars.com/Blog/Charlie-Sheen-Abruptly-Quits--Two-And-A-Half-Men--With-No-Remorse.aspx?BlogID=a8e449d1-240c-4ddf-b728-80124c61647e |archive-date=April 15, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Charlie is killed sometime between seasons 8 and 9 as he is hit by a train and it is revealed that he had proposed marriage to Rose before his death. While Alan is in the hospital, Charlie's [[ghost]] appears to him (It is implied that this is due to a hallucinogenic reaction due to the medication Alan was on.) and explains that his spirit now lives on in Hell forced to live eternally in a woman's body ([[Kathy Bates]]) as punishment for his womanizing behavior during his lifetime. He acts as his brother's spirit guide, though he later confessed that he really could not care less about what he does. Before returning to the afterlife, Charlie tries to reveal himself to Jake but fails. As a result of [[retroactive continuity]], the series finale reveals that Charlie never died but has been held captive by Rose in a basement pit under her house in Sherman Oaks. He escapes, collects $2.5 million in royalty money from his children's songs, and sends Alan, Evelyn and Walden, who Rose has told him about, texts and emails promising revenge while also sending large checks to his former romantic interests, Jenny, and Jake. However, as he is about to enter the beach house a grand piano being transported to the house by helicopter falls on him, killing him thus ending the show.\n\n=== Alan Harper ===\n{{main|Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)}}\nDr. Alan Jerome Harper ([[Jon Cryer]], Seasons 1\u201312), Charlie's younger brother, who is well-meaning but continuously makes poor choices and mistakes, while also being bullied by Charlie, Berta and Judith. He and his ex-wife, Judith, are Jake's parents, and Alan is possibly the biological father of Judith's second child, a daughter named Millie Melnick. After losing his house to Judith in the divorce, he moves in with Charlie. He is generally a pleasant and supportive man, but seems to have an attraction to women who treat him poorly, which may stem from the non-nurturing relationship he had with his and Charlie's mother. In the [[Two and a Half Men (season 4)|season 4]] episode, \"Repeated Blows to His Unformed Head\", it is revealed that Alan has a [[Maieusiophilia|pregnancy fetish]], which he says is due to Judith only varying from her [[sexless marriage]] policy while pregnant with Jake. Also, in the [[Two and a Half Men (season 6)|Season 6]] episode, \"She'll Still Be Dead at Halftime\", he confesses that he likes feet (see [[foot fetish]]). In the season 3 finale, Alan marries a twenty-two-year-old dumbbell named Kandi who was one of Charlie's former girlfriends. After Charlie had canceled his wedding with Mia, Alan and Kandi got married instead. Although in the season 4 premiere, four months after the marriage Kandi throws Alan out of her condo and divorces Alan which leads him to paying alimony to two ex-wives.\n\nIn season six, Alan starts his first serious relationship since his second divorce. Alan starts dating his receptionist, Melissa. The relationship gets serious when Melissa has Alan move in with her and her mother, but their happiness is short lived when Melissa's mother gets Alan high on brownies and seduces him. Melissa walks in on them, but Alan is too high to explain what happened. Melissa breaks up with Alan and kicks him out. In the season six finale, while Judith is giving birth to what is possibly Alan's daughter, Alan and Melissa meet up and have sex in a closet, ultimately getting back together. Their relationship goes into season seven where Melissa wants to move into the beach house with Alan, Charlie, and Chelsea. Alan is happy to live with Melissa at first, but eventually Melissa and Chelsea start taking over the house, resulting in Alan and Charlie staying at a hotel. Alan and Charlie call Evelyn to fix everything. Evelyn tells Chelsea about Melissa's short lived romance resulting in the girls getting into a fight, and Melissa moving out. Alan and Melissa are now forced to have sex in their car since Melissa won't let Alan see her mother at her house, and Melissa doesn't want to see Chelsea at Alan's house. Melissa tells Alan to get his own house, so Alan steals the keys to a house Evelyn is selling, and lies to Melissa, saying that it's his. When Alan and Melissa get caught, they sneak out the window, but the cops find Alan in nothing but his briefs and when he tries to explain what happened, he turns to Melissa only to find she's gone.\n\nTowards the end of season seven, Alan starts dating Lyndsey McElroy, the mother of Jake's friend, Eldridge, and Judith's neighbor. Alan and Lyndsey date for the last three episodes of the seventh season, and their relationship goes into season eight. Lyndsey and Alan get serious and Lyndsey has Alan move in with her. After moving in, Alan goes to the liquor store where he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Melissa. Alan and Melissa start an affair, but the affair is short lived when he decides to move on from Melissa and continue his relationship with Lyndsey. At Lyndsey's house, Alan smokes a pipe which Lynsey finds sexy. Lyndsey takes Alan upstairs to have sex, but Alan didn't realize he put the pipe down while it was still lit, resulting in him burning down Lyndsey's house. Lyndsey stays mad at Alan for most of the next episode, but when she finally forgives him, her ex-husband Chris steps in and makes up with Lyndsey, leaving Alan brokenhearted and alone again. Several episodes later, Lyndsey breaks up with her ex-husband when she realizes she's lost feelings for him. Alan and Lyndsey get back together, and date for rest of the eighth season.\n\nAlan is two years younger than Charlie. Prior to ''Two and a Half Men,'' Cryer and Sheen appeared together in the 1991 comedy ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' Cryer also won the 2009 Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Alan stays at the house as Walden temporarily lets him after helping him with Bridget, but Walden later insists that Alan stay with him permanently when Alan, with Bridget's help, saves him from Courtney ([[Jenny McCarthy]]), a femme fatale who previously had a relationship with Charlie, and was out to get Walden's money. Alan and Walden became best friends after that. This friendship eventually earned Alan a position as a board member of Walden's company and his name on the deed of the beach house. Walden also renamed his company \"Walden Loves Alan Enterprises\" in honor of his best friend. As of season 9, Cryer is the only actor on the show to appear in every episode of the series. Alan continues his romance with Lyndsey during season nine, only for her to break up with him again after she finds out about all of his lies.\n\nWhile Walden is dating Zoey, Zoey sees right through Alan and knows that he is sponging off Walden. Walden and Zoey go on a date one night and reluctantly take Alan with them. At dinner, Alan sees his ex-girlfriend Lyndsey. Alan and Lyndsey reconcile at the end of the episode. Alan dates Lyndsey throughout the rest of season nine, and reveals to Jake that he and Lyndsey have no intention of getting married.\n\nIn season ten, Walden starts to grow tired of Alan living with him, and begins to get more annoyed. Alan continues to sponge off of Walden for money, and Walden continuously asks when he is moving out. Alan and Lyndsey continue their relationship, but Lyndsey starts to fantasize about other people when seeing Alan. In \"Something My Gynecologist Said\", Lyndsey asks Alan for a commitment since her gynecologist asked her out. Alan is reluctant, resulting in Lyndsey breaking up with him again. That night, Alan goes over to Lyndsey's house and proposes to her. Alan tells her that as soon as he has enough money, he'll put a deposit down on a ring.\n\nNot too long after getting engaged, Alan gets an email from his second ex-wife, Kandi who's in town and wants to get coffee. Kandi tries getting back together with Alan, but he refuses due to his relationship with Lyndsey. Towards the end of season ten, Lyndsey breaks up with Alan after she feels like all the spark in their relationship is gone.\n\nIn the final episode, Alan tries to take the $2.5 million in back royalties from Charlie and ends up fleeing from a very angry dungeon escapee (Charlie). Finally he is back as always living at the beach house since Lyndsey doesn't appear to be marrying him.\n\n=== Jake Harper ===\nJacob David<ref name=\"S01E17\">{{cite episode|title=Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats|series=Two and a Half Men|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 1)#ep17|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|date=February 23, 2004|season=1|number=17}}</ref> \"Jake\" Harper (born November 14, 1993) ([[Angus T. Jones]], Seasons 1\u201310; main, Season 12; guest) is the son of Alan and Judith, while [[E. G. Daily]] provided the singing voice for Jake in the opening and closing theme songs of seasons 1\u20138, and the first two episodes of season 9. He spends most of his free time playing video games, eating, watching television, playing the guitar, sleeping, and getting high with his best friend Eldridge. He is also an excellent poker player and a fairly good cook, but is very uneducated and stubborn, which coupled with his excessive [[flatulence]], is a frequent theme of jokes about him. Despite his apparent lack of intelligence, he is sometimes very observant. He is friendly, innocent and he clearly loves his father and uncle, but is often dismissive towards them. He blamed his parents [[divorce]] on Alan for many years and continually rebelled against him for that reason and it was only after he enlisted that he realized that Judith had more to do with the divorce than he'd originally thought. Jake's style, personality and attitude changes as the series progresses, from a more cute, little-boy charm in the first season to a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] teenager in later seasons. After Charlie's death, Jake at first does not show any emotion but it is later revealed that, like Alan, he painfully misses him and still [[Grief|grieves his death]] (though not as bad as Alan). He proceeds to tell his father that the most important thing Charlie taught him was that when he is his uncle's age he wants to be married and have a family, because Charlie seemed very lonely and unhappy. Despite his young age, he has proven himself to be charming enough to get sex from older women (as evidenced in seasons 9 and 10). Jake and Eldridge decide to join the Army following their high school graduation. Jake forms a friendship with Walden, who buys the beach house, and has such an impact on his life he tells Walden that he would name his child with his then girlfriend Tammy, Walden Harper. At the end of the tenth season he announces to the household that he is being shipped to [[Japan]] for a year. He and Alan go on a father son bonding trip together (one that he wanted Walden to come on) before he leaves.\n\nThough mentioned often, Jake is absent throughout all of season 11, and is also featured (via archive footage) in a montage paying tribute to him in the fifth episode of season 12.\n\n[[Angus T. Jones]] makes a cameo appearance reprising his role in the second half of the series finale in season 12, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\". Jake is passing through town and pays a visit to Alan and Walden, informing them that he is no longer in the army and has gotten married to a Japanese dancer, and is the stepfather to her two children. He also mentions that Charlie (who is revealed to still be alive) sent him a check for $250,000 along with a note that simply states \"I'm alive\". Upon learning that Charlie is on the loose and is out to kill Alan and Walden, a scared Jake bids Alan, Walden, and Berta goodbye as he immediately leaves the beach house for the final time. Both his entrance and exit are followed by a long studio applause.\n\n=== Walden Schmidt ===\n{{main|Walden Schmidt}}\nWalden Schmidt ([[Ashton Kutcher]], Seasons 9\u201312) is a [[billionaire]] [[internet entrepreneur]] who has recently been divorced and was suicidal when Alan first met him. When Charlie supposedly dies and leaves the house to Alan, Alan puts the house on the market because he is unable to make payments on the three mortgages. Guest stars [[John Stamos]], [[Jenna Elfman]] and [[Thomas Gibson]] view the house but do not buy it. While Alan is speaking to Charlie's ashes and trying to decide where to spread them, Walden appears from nowhere on the back deck, scaring Alan and causing him to drop the ashes across the living room floor. Once inside, he reveals that he was trying to drown himself in the ocean, having been recently divorced from his wife Bridget, portrayed by [[Judy Greer]]. He and Alan bond at Pavlov's bar, where he tells Alan that he made his $1.3 billion fortune by selling his website to [[Microsoft]]. After picking up two women and bringing them back to the house, where he sleeps with them, he decides to buy the house.\n\nHis wife describes him as emotionally immature, which upsets him, so, with Alan's help, he returns to his mansion to confront his wife in the hope of reconciling. However, he is sent away after being treated for an electric shock that he received while climbing the front gates of the mansion. Walden gets a second chance when Bridget later decides that she had been too harsh and that he deserves a chance to prove he is not as childish as he was; this chance is quickly ruined by a food fight between Walden and a little girl in the middle of Soup Plantation. Walden eventually invites Alan and Jake to continue living at the house they have been living in for 8 years with him as Walden wants someone around he can trust, and they became best friends. He used to walk around the house naked, and is often barefoot. He drives a [[Fisker Karma]], and asks Evelyn to remodel the house using [[solar power]] and [[wind power]].\n\nWalden starts dating a [[British people|British]] woman named Zoey ([[Sophie Winkleman]]) whom he met at the supermarket. Bridget later comes wanting Walden back but he declines her wanting Zoey instead. She later is seen stalking him where she runs into Rose who says she can help make Walden suffer. Bridget reluctantly goes with her. Walden was introduced with a beard and long, greasy hair, but when he started to get serious with Zoey, he decided to cut his hair and shave. Walden has also matured a great deal by spending time with Alan and dating Zoey. Though he still considers Alan his best friend, he eventually became aware that Alan is a freeloader and now understands what Charlie had to put up with. In season ten, Walden proposes to Zoey but she turns him down, and leaves him for another man. He starts dating Charlie's former stalker Rose, but Zoey tries to reconcile with Walden, telling him she made a mistake. When Walden tells Rose that they're going to have to break up. Rose acts like she is okay with it at first, but after leaving, she sends two ferrets to attack Walden. Rose goes to Zoey's apartment wearing a pregnancy harness and tells Zoey that Walden got her pregnant. Zoey breaks up with Walden for good once more without letting him explain himself.\n\nLater in the season, Walden takes the alias of Sam Wilson and pretends to be a regular, average guy so he can find someone who isn't after his money. Walden meets Kate ([[Brooke D'Orsay]]), and tells her that he lives with billionaire, Alan Harper. Kate invites Walden to be her roommate, and they ultimately start dating. Walden keeps the lie going for several episodes until he wants to help Kate set up a fashion line of clothes she designed. Walden put US $100,000 in Alan's bank account so he can invest in Kate. After Kate goes to New York, Walden decides to confess who he really is. Walden meets Kate in New York and tells her the truth. Kate breaks up with Walden, but forgives him when she realizes he helped make her dream of being a fashion designer come true. Kate and Walden don't get back together, due to Kate staying in New York. On Valentine's Day, Walden and Kate meet up and sleep together. When they realize they can't get back together due to conflicting schedules, the couple agree to see other people.\n\nAlan and Walden get married so Walden can adopt a child and not live alone. The adoption goes through so Alan and Walden divorce and Walden ends up dating their adoption social worker. After the scare from a threatening Charlie Harper, friends Alan and Walden continue to live together in Walden's beach house.\n\n=== Jenny ===\n<!-- Do not change the name to \"Jenny Harper\" until such time as there is evidence that \"Harper\" is her last name. Addition of \"Harper\" requires an inline citation. -->\nJenny<ref name=eonline>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/437676/charlie-sheen-s-daughter-to-be-gay-on-two-and-a-half-men-get-the-details |title=Charlie Sheen's Daughter to Be Gay on Two and a Half Men\u2014Get the Details! |work=Uk.eonline.com |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> ([[Amber Tamblyn]], Season 11; main, season 12; recurring) is the long lost, illegitimate daughter of Charlie Harper. An aspiring actress, Jenny first appears in the premiere episode of season 11, in which she comes to Malibu hoping to reconnect with her dad, though Walden and her uncle Alan tell her he is dead. It is later revealed that she is a lesbian, and some episodes of the eleventh season put emphasis on this, to the point of [[Satire|comedically]] [[Gay stereotyping|portraying]] Jenny as a stereotypical lesbian who is uninterested in serious relationships and is content to have sex with any woman she meets, to the point that she is able to seduce (or \"recruit\") straight women (at one point, Walden claims that he didn't know one of Jenny's one-night-stands, who is his friend, was a lesbian, and Jenny responds \"Neither did she until last week\", insinuating that the woman was straight but Jenny made her gay), among them Walden's own mother. A brief running gag is Walden and Alan trying to keep their dates from meeting Jenny for this exact reason, though later in the series she abandons her promiscuous lifestyle and tries to find a steady lover. After warming up to her, Walden and Alan invite her to move in after she reveals she has nowhere to go. Though she exhibits many of Charlie's personality traits (particularly his sarcasm, alcoholism, and womanizing), Jenny is considerably much nicer and down-to-earth than he was. Thus far, she has formed good relationships with her surviving relatives, Walden, Berta and Walden's friend Barry ([[Clark Duke]]). She and Jake have never met thus far, but she does know he exists and would like to meet him. In \"Welcome Home, Jake\" she meets Barry for the first time, mistaking him for Jake. She happily gives him a hug only to be disgusted when she discovers the truth. She eventually takes a liking to Barry and the two become the best of friends. Though it is apparent that Walden is attracted to her, he believes she has no drive or ambition. Fearing she may turn into \"another Alan\", he tries to be a positive role model for her. Jenny considered Walden the greatest father figure she'd ever had. She moved from her home in [[New York City]] in order to find her dad in Malibu. She apparently has a poor relationship with her mother (like her father did) and the only reason she became an actress was \"to piss her mother off,\" as she wanted her to become a doctor. In the twelfth season, Jenny uses her experience in the LGBT community to help Walden and Alan pose as a gay couple so that they can adopt Louis, and moves out of the beach house so Louis can stay in Jake's room. She makes a brief appearance in the final episode, where she receives a large cheque and an apology letter from Charlie, who survived his accident in Paris. She also appears to have gone back to her promiscuous ways, given that she was apparently having a threesome with two women and forgot they were in her bedroom.\n\nDespite being introduced as the new \"half man\" in the eleventh season, she was replaced in that capacity by another character, Louis for the twelfth and final season. Tamblyn's billing is also demoted to below Conchata Ferrell's, as the role was now recurring rather than regular.\n\n=== Louis ===\nLouis (Edan Alexander, Season 12) is the child whom Walden and Alan foster. Louis and Alan bond almost instantly, whereas he and Walden initially do not bond, but they eventually find a common ground and form a strong father-son relationship. He also takes a liking to Berta and Evelyn as well. Louis' favorite snacks are Cheez-Its, cereal, and pancakes. He is officially adopted by Walden in the third-to-last episode. Notably, Louis is the only main character physically absent in the series finale, \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\", this absence not being explained, although a picture of him was shown.\n\n=== Berta ===\nBerta ([[Conchata Ferrell]], Season 1 recurring; Seasons 2\u201312 regular) is the family housekeeper. Although she may be viewed as sarcastic, rude and sometimes outright disrespectful, Alan and Charlie still treat her with enormous respect, partly out of fear, and it is clear that the household cannot function properly without her. Berta has tried her best not to allow the overwhelming stress of her job to get to her head: when the very tidy Alan moved in, she quit and Charlie was so upset that Alan had to personally beg her to return, promising that Alan would do his own cleaning. However, the fact that Jake's bedroom could be confused with a dump (at various times including dead fish in the closet, food left-overs in his toy box, and nasal mucus under the bed), his toilet seat is frequently sprayed with urine, and his underwear is filthy, often leads to anger on her part. Her favorite line after a mini-disaster occurs in the house is, \"I ain't cleaning that up.\" During the Kutcher years of the show her role on screen was increased. Season 11 was the first time she appeared in every single episode of a season.\n\nBerta has a sister named Daisy ([[Camryn Manheim]]), with whom she does not get along. She also has three daughters and several granddaughters, whom she admits are \"sleazy and easy\" and sometimes brings along to work; a notable example was teenage granddaughter Prudence ([[Megan Fox]]). Berta has two ex-husbands; her first marriage lasted 15 years, and her second was a drunken Las Vegas escapade she refers to as \"one hell of a weekend\" which ended when she divorced him in Reno. She has served time in [[prison]] and worked as a prison barber. She uses, and makes references to, drugs (legal and otherwise); it is hinted that she has enjoyed many a joint during work hours and can produce a perfect one given the opportunity. She takes anxiolytics (Valium especially) in her coffee to reduce her violent tendencies. She was a [[groupie]] with the [[Grateful Dead]] and has implied that she had a lesbian experience during that time. While it was hinted several times before Charlie's death that he had changed his will so she'd inherit the beach house instead of Alan, that turned out to be untrue, although Berta was set to move out because the house had mortgages attached that Alan had no chance of paying.\n\nBerta often calls Alan \"Zippy\". She and Alan are portrayed as the only people saddened over Charlie's death. She considered him to be the best boss she ever had. After Walden buys the house, he asks her to remain there as a live-in housekeeper. She agrees, mainly because she is extremely attracted to Walden and would often make discreet advances at him. This living arrangement is short-lived when she finds out that Alan will be moving back in, only this becomes more likely when Walden sees Berta invite a piggish houseguest over. She never thought she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but admits to Walden that he is instead the greatest boss she ever had, making Charlie second-best. Berta hardly ever shows any signs of attraction to Walden after season nine. Despite her displeasure of Jake's presence in the house when he originally moved in, she's far more friendly and welcoming to Louis when he moves in because he's cute and his background is similar to hers. \n\nIn 2014, Ferrell revealed that Berta was originally intended to be an ethnic minority, but producers liked the way Ferrell performed the role. She also revealed that Berta was only intended to be in a two-episode arc of the first season and would leave due to Alan and his kid moving into the beach house, but producers extended the role and eventually made her a main cast member from season 2 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/conchata-ferrell-two-and-half-men-and-her-crusty-b-210339|title=Conchata Ferrell on Two And A Half Men and her \"crusty but benign\" career|first=Will|last=Harris|date=|website=avclub.com}}</ref> In the final episode, Berta gets a large check from Charlie and seems to retire to Walden's beach house.\n\n=== Evelyn Harper ===\n'''Evelyn Pepper''' (previously '''Harper, Gorsky, Thomas, King and Leopold'''; [[Holland Taylor]], Seasons 1\u20139 regular; Seasons 10\u201312 recurring) is Charlie and Alan's mother and Jake and Jenny's grandmother. In the first season, she is 58 years old; out of vanity, she changes the year of her birth as she ages. She expresses a superficial fondness for her sons and grandson, but she rarely lives up to her self-perceived notion of being a devoted and misunderstood [[Matriarchy|matriarch]]. Her sons and grandson generally return the favor and go out of their way to avoid interacting with her on most occasions. Her wide-ranging sex life is a recurring gag throughout the series  as she is attracted to both men and women. In addition to [[#Teddy Leopold|Teddy]] who was not actually \"[[#Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman|Courtney]]\"'s father, Evelyn has been sexually involved with several parents of her sons' lovers and friends, including [[#Rose|Rose]]'s father, Gloria's mother, Gloria's presumed father, Gloria's likely biological father (i.e., the boys' father, Frank Harper), Walden's mother (with whom Charlie's daughter, Jenny, had already had sex),<ref>Jenny and Robin shared a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] with [[Lynda Carter]]; Evelyn and Robin subsequently did so with [[Michael Bolton]].</ref> and Lyndsey's mother. She also bedded Charlie's ex-girlfriend Jill who had become Bill, and [[Walden Schmidt|Walden]]. Evelyn has been widowed five times, her fifth marriage being the shortest as he died an hour after saying their vows.\n\nThe family frequently refers to her as \"the devil\" (or, as Charlie put it, \"unholy mother of us\"), and Charlie has her number on speed-dial in his cell phone as \"[[Number of the Beast|666]].\" Once, she showed up at the door in a black cloak while carrying a scythe. When Alan asked who it was, Charlie responded \"It's Death,\" to which Alan replied, \"Hi, mom!\" It has been implied on one occasion that she is ''literally'' a witch (who is dreaded and feared by other witches) \u2013 one of Charlie's girls was a worshipper of the Devil, and was scared away by Evelyn. Wealthy, with a luxurious house in [[Beverly Hills]], she has been married numerous times and sells [[Real estate agent|real estate]]. When Charlie died, surprisingly, she was distraught over his death. At his funeral, however, she continuously mentions her intention to sell his house ''while'' Alan was giving his eulogy. Her relationship with Alan has somewhat gotten better since Charlie's death, as she has acknowledged that he is not just her second-born son, he is now the only son she has left, as well. When Alan almost died from a heart attack, she feared for his life, because not only did she not want to lose another child, her \"good son\" was already deceased.\n\nTwo years after Charlie's death, she finally meets her long lost granddaughter Jenny. Surprisingly, Evelyn embraces her newfound grandchild and completely disowns Jake; she had previously said she would have enjoyed a relationship with Jake, but \"got to him\" too late for proper bonding. In the eleventh season she marries for the sixth time, this time to her much older lover, Marty Pepper.\n\nShe rarely appeared during season nine, but was prominent in the last few episodes of the season. Despite still credited and billed as a main character, Evelyn only made one appearance in the tenth season and several appearances in season eleven. In the final season she shows up at Alan and Walden's wedding followed by sleeping with \"Michael Bolton\" and Walden's mother Robin then also has sex with a fake Santa Claus and in the last episode when Alan needs Charlie's death certificate and she gets threatening message from Charlie.\n\n=== Judith Harper-Melnick ===\nJudith Harper-Melnick ([[Marin Hinkle]], Seasons 1\u20139 regular; Seasons 10\u201312 guest) is Alan's cheating, vindictive, cold hearted, self-absorbed, and humorless first wife. She seems to despise Alan and takes any chance to humiliate him. She was the first woman Alan ever slept with, but their marriage was cold: according to her, the only time she was ever happy being sexual was when she was pregnant with Jake. In the pilot, she lied to him about realizing she was homosexual as an excuse to end the marriage, and in subsequent episode he caught her picking up multiple men. She made no secret of living luxuriously with Alan's [[alimony]], seeing as she has not held a job since she divorced him. She has since remarried to Dr. Herbert \"Herb\" Melnick ([[Ryan Stiles]]), Jake's pediatrician, a union that brought joy to Alan because it meant he no longer had to pay alimony.\n\nIn season six, she threw Herb out of the house and briefly reunited with Alan before reconciling with Herb, and it was later revealed she was pregnant with a daughter, whom she eventually named Millie. Alan hoped he was the father, but Judith said she would kill him if he revealed that he slept with her, and after she gave birth in the sixth season finale, the child's parentage remained uncertain, as Judith was with both Herb and Alan around the time Millie was conceived. Jake and Berta describe Millie as looking nothing like Judith or Herb but more like a girl version of Alan, implying Alan is the probable biological father.\n\nIn seasons seven and nine, Judith made very few appearances but was featured in almost every episode in season eight. Unlike her relationship with Charlie, Judith got along with Walden just fine \u2013 mostly due to her initial interest in him. She was not seen since the season nine finale until towards the end of season ten, with only being briefly mentioned for most of the season. In the episode \"Run, Steven Staven! Run!\", Judith's absence is finally explained when Herb mentions that Judith moved out when he cheated on her with his receptionist (yet in season 11, she is shown to still be living there). However, in the 19th episode of season ten, she reappears after a long absence when Herb starts to go crazy. Walden and Alan call her to go to Herb's hotel room and take him back.\n\nShe plays a major role in the season eleven episode \"Cab Fare and a Bottle of Penicillin\", when Alan showed up at her house just to talk about old times and after a night of drinking they end up engaged. However, in the end, Judith ends the engagement after Walden explains to her that Alan had proposed to Lindsey the same night he proposed to her (however he did not explain that she didn't accept Alan's proposal as she is now engaged to Larry). Angered by this, she kicks Alan in the groin. It is unknown if she and Herb have officially divorced or are just separated. In the final episode, Alan calls her thinking that Charlie is going to kill him and he tells her that she was his only true love. She tells him she has another call and hangs up on him.\n\n=== Rose ===\nRose ([[Melanie Lynskey]], Seasons 1\u20132 regular; Seasons 3\u201312 recurring) is the Harpers' wealthy neighbor and Charlie's stalker and after his death, she finds new love and a stalker victim in Walden. She was one of Charlie's one-night stands who won't allow him to forget about her as he does all his other sexual conquests. Rose acknowledges that she is \"boundary challenged\", while Charlie and Alan refer to her as Charlie's stalker. In the pilot, she told Alan that she sneaks into Charlie's room while he's asleep and tries on his underwear. Usually uninvited, she enters and exits Charlie's house by climbing onto the backyard deck, rather than using the front door. She has been caught by Charlie and Alan as she has watched them while sleeping on several occasions. While credited among the main cast in CBS press releases in Season 3\u20134, she was credited as a recurring star in on-screen credits.<ref name=\"S3S4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20060821cbs06 |title=Listings &#124; TheFutonCritic.com |work=TheFutonCritic.com |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref> After season 4, she left for London and appeared on the show only rarely. She later returns to Malibu in Season 5, though no longer living next door to Charlie, hence her less frequent appearances. She claims she was sent away from England after \"an incident at Buckingham Palace.\" In Season 6, she became friends with Charlie's fianc\u00e9e Chelsea and went on a blind date with Alan; the two began dating before Rose evinced the same jealousy and possessiveness towards Alan that she had applied towards Charlie, right down to gluing things to his genitals. Although she is somewhat mentally unhinged and obsessed with Charlie, Rose expressed that she \"has an undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] (which she completed in 2 years) and a [[master's degree]] in [[behavioral psychology]] from [[Stanford University]].\" Throughout the series, Rose has applied her knowledge of interpersonal communication towards the various situations that arise. Her family is involved in banking and oil, making them, and implicitly her, extremely wealthy. [[Martin Sheen]], who is Charlie Sheen's real-life father, made a guest-appearance on the show as Rose's equally-disturbed father, Harvey, who similarly obsessed over Evelyn after sleeping with her once. Rose's paternal grandparents were first cousins, to which her grandmother attributes Rose's and Harvey's mental issues. Rose also has five ferrets, all named \"Charlie,\" as was revealed in Season 2's \"The Salmon Under My Sweater.\" Her only appearance in Season 7 was in \"Gumby with a Pokey\" when Charlie begins to hallucinate (after taking medicinal marijuana). Women in his past interrogate why he mistreated them, then he goes out to the deck to discover Rose; unlike the other women, Rose is really there. She made multiple appearances in Season 8, after staging her wedding, which makes Charlie realize he probably loves her. In the last episode of Season 8, Charlie leaves for Paris with her. In Season 9, Rose reveals that she and Charlie got engaged in Paris. It is implied she may have had something to do with Charlie's death after she returned to their Paris hotel to find him showering with another woman. She reappears again at the end of \"What a Lovely Landing Strip\" catching Walden's ex-wife Bridget spying on Walden and his new girlfriend, she then tells her that she can help her in making Walden suffer. She makes a brief cameo through archive footage in a flashback montage in the episode \"Oh Look! Al-Qaeda!\". She returns in Season 10's \"That's Not What They Call It in Amsterdam\" now dating Walden, much to Alan's dismay. The relationship gets serious but is short lived when Walden reconciles with Zoey. However, Rose gets revenge by telling Zoey that she is pregnant with Walden's baby. Walden ends up without Zoey or Rose. Rose continues to stalk Walden as well as the Harpers, despite Charlie's death. Rose returns in \"Advantage: Fat, Flying Baby\", at the end where it's discovered that Rose is Walden's girlfriend's new investor for her fashion line. In the series finale \"Of Course He's Dead\", it is revealed that Rose lied about Charlie's death. She did catch him cheating and kept him imprisoned in her basement. However, Charlie escaped and used the royalties from his children's songs to pay back all the people he wronged and threatened Evelyn, Alan and Walden. Rose reveals the truth to them, but is not jailed for the crime. The character has been described as a sociopath although she has a warm and friendly exterior.<ref>http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/repairing-relationships/201202/is-your-partner-sociopath</ref>\n\n=== Kandi ===\nKandi Harper ([[April Bowlby]], Season 3 recurring, Season 4 main, Season 10 guest, Season 12 guest) is Alan's second ex-wife. While credited among the main cast during the fourth season, CBS press releases billed her as a recurring character.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Initially Charlie's gorgeous but dim-witted girlfriend until Charlie broke it off with her so he could date Mia. When Judith (who later became Kandi's confidante) initially tried to end Kandi's relationship with Alan, Kandi's mother Mandi ([[Gail O'Grady]]), who also had a brief fling with Charlie during that time, made sure the couple were dating again. During this time Judith briefly dated Kandi's father Andi ([[Kevin Sorbo]]) leading an interesting joke Jake told his father about the possibility Kandi could be his stepmother, stepsister and stepcousin all at once. Kandi and Alan had a superficial relationship based mostly on sex, but they eventually wed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where they also won half a million dollars. After only four months of marriage, and spending nearly all of their winnings, Kandi kicked Alan out of their condominium, which was later revealed to be because Alan did not want to have another child with her. With Judith's help, Kandi acquires (and [[Attorney misconduct|seduces]]) Judith's lawyer from her divorce and, despite only being married to him four months, manages to claim alimony payments from Alan, making him all the poorer and dependent on Charlie. Kandi is soon offered a role as a forensics expert on a ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]''-type television series, entitled ''Stiffs''. At the same time, Alan sees that Jake is practically grown up and he returns to Kandi to agree to have a baby with her. However, moments before they try to conceive, Kandi finally signs the divorce papers to ensure that Alan will not have any claim on her new-found television lucre, and disappears from Alan's life. In the tenth season, Kandi resurfaces as a television star and tries to win Alan back, but despite his temptations, Alan ultimately rejects her, as he is in a relationship with Lyndsey McElroy. After a paparazzo acquires [[Photoshop|altered]] photographs of them together, Kandi goes to explain the situation to Lyndsey, and for unknown reasons they end up having sex. \n\nIn the final episode, Kandi has become a celebrity, and is seen being mobbed by photographers. Alan, fearing the wrath of a very-alive Charlie, telephones her to tell her she was the love of his life. She is the only one of Alan's lovers to be genuinely touched by his words, indicating that she may have been the only woman to actually love Alan. \n\nPrior to playing Kandi, Bowlby had appeared as another character named Kimber.\n\n=== Chelsea Melini ===\nChelsea Christine Melini ([[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Bini Taylor]], Season 6 recurring; Season 7 regular, Season 9 guest, Season 12 guest) is Charlie's girlfriend for most of season six, who has moved into his house by the season's end. Formerly a [[one-night stand]], Chelsea seems to be one of the few women out of Charlie's countless relationships that has caused him to try to make positive changes in his debaucherous lifestyle. She became close friends with Alan, something Charlie enjoyed because Alan could take her to museums and foreign films (activities that Charlie cannot stand). In the seventh season premiere, Charlie finally decides to let go of Mia and commit to Chelsea. As the season progresses they plan to marry but, after Chelsea becomes attracted to Alan's lawyer and Charlie vomits on a baby, Chelsea postpones the wedding. In Season 7 Charlie and Chelsea make several attempts to reconcile, most recently following her breakup with Brad (the man Chelsea left Charlie for). Chelsea tried to reunite with Charlie, but was thwarted due to her best friend, Gail ([[Tricia Helfer]]), sleeping with him. Jake later gives Chelsea a necklace that Charlie got her for her birthday and she goes outside to see him but when she got there, Charlie was in trouble with the police for rear ending a police car, with a suspended license. Jake was driving at the beginning of this episode, but when the police came after them in a cop car, Jake and Charlie switched seats, causing Charlie to lose his license. While credited among the main cast as Jennifer Taylor during the seventh season, CBS press releases bill her as a recurring character. At Charlie's funeral, she says he gave her [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]. She appears in the [[Of Course He's Dead|finale]] with a huge check from Charlie and an apology letter for shooting her while they were dating. \n\nBini Taylor previously appeared in the pilot episode as woman in the grocery store aisle complimenting Charlie and Jake, and again in Season 2 as Tina, one of the women Charlie apologises to as he tries to find out who set up the 'Charlie Harper Sucks' website.\n\n== Recurring  characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 7)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 8)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 9)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 10)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 11)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Two and a Half Men (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Herb Melnick|Herb Melnick]]\n| [[Ryan Stiles]]\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"1\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"5\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Dr. Linda Freeman|Dr. Linda Freeman]]\n| [[Jane Lynch]]\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" colspan=\"7\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"1\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" | \n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Mia|Mia]]\n| [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"2\" |\n| style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Recurring\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"3\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n| style=\"background: #ececec; color:grey;\" colspan=\"2\" |\n| style=\"background: #ddccf2\" colspan=\"1\" | Guest\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Gordon|Gordon]]\n| [[J.

Well mannered and intelligent, Ava adored Walden, and is 108th [[Line of succession to the British throne|in line to the throne]].<ref>Ava's father, Nigel Pierce, counters Zoey's mention of Walden being a billionaire in episode 9.15 by noting that he [Nigel] is 107th in line to the throne.</ref> Ava invites Walden to her birthday during season ten, despite her mother having broken up with him.\n\n=== Billy Stanhope ===\nBilly Stanhope ([[Patton Oswalt]], season 9\u201310), Walden's business partner and frenemy. Walden and Billy have a love-and-hate relationship, and even though they don't realize it, they're probably best friends. In season nine, after years of not speaking to each other, Walden and Billy start their business back up again and work together on a project they call the \"electronic suitcase\". In Billy's next appearance, he reveals that he has been seeing Walden's ex-wife, Bridget. Walden and Billy sell the electronic suitcase in season ten for $1.2 billion. In mid-season ten, Bridget breaks up with Billy, resulting in Walden, Alan, Billy, and Herb having a guys' night out, drinking and complaining about women. He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Bridget Schmidt ===\nBridget Schmidt ([[Judy Greer]], season 9\u201310, season 12), the ex-wife of Walden Schmidt. She initiated the divorce proceedings because she felt Walden would never become a mature adult, but after the divorce was ready to be finalized she decided she loved him anew and wanted him back. Unfortunately, Walden decided to sign the divorce papers and continue his nascent relationship with Zoey, leading Bridget to become violently unhinged and to fall into the orbit of a returned-from-Paris Rose.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=People Who Love Peepholes|episodelink=Two and a Half Men (season 9)#ep179|series=Two and a Half Men|serieslink=Two and a Half Men|airdate=September 26, 2011|season=9|number=2}}</ref> This is later proven to be a one-off gag for that particular episode as Bridget later started dating Walden's business partner, Billy, at the end of season nine, but she left him in \"Run, Steven Staven! Run!\". Bridget makes an appearance in the series finale \"[[Of Course He's Dead]]\" in which she talks to Walden on the phone while in bed with actor [[John Stamos]], who previously appeared in \"[[Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt]]\" (Walden's debut episode).\n\nIn Season 4, Greer portrayed the role of Myra Melnick the sister of [[#Herb Melnick|Herb Melnick]], Judith's fianc\u00e9/husband, in the episodes \"[[Two and a Half Men (season 4)#ep91|Smooth as a Ken Doll]]\" and \"[[Two and a Half Men (season 4)#ep92|Aunt Myra Doesn't Pee a Lot]]\", during which she had a brief swing with Charlie before she returned home to her [[fianc\u00e9]], whose existence came as a shock to Charlie.\n\n=== Celeste ===\nCeleste ([[Tinashe Kachingwe]], seasons 6\u20137), Jake's ex-girlfriend, and main love interest of seasons six and seven. Jake first meets Celeste when she and her dad, Jerome, move in next door to Charlie. Jake and Celeste secretly date at first because her father is over protective, but he eventually gives the couple his blessing. Celeste shows to be controlling over Jake, but he doesn't seem to notice. In season seven, Celeste spends Christmas with her mother, so Charlie convinces Jake to cheat on Celeste. Celeste stops by Charlie's house to give Jake his Christmas present, but when she sees that he is cheating on her, she breaks up with him. Jake tries to get Celeste back in the following episode, but has no luck.\n\n=== Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman ===\nCourtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman ([[Jenny McCarthy]], seasons 5, 8\u20139), Charlie's girlfriend for a multi-episode thread. Charlie falls for \"Courtney\", whom he believes is the daughter of Evelyn's fianc\u00e9, and lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes shortly before they are to become step-siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart-broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia Fishman, but he retains feelings for her, telling her that he will \"wait\" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's \"Ow, Ow, Don't Stop\" after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her. The two break up two episodes later in \"Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead\" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. In the season 9 episode \"Nine Magic Fingers\", Courtney starts dating Walden, but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget successfully convince Walden that Courtney is a con artist.\n\n=== Dr. Linda Freeman ===\nDr. Linda Freeman ([[Jane Lynch]], seasons 1, 3\u20139, 11), initially as Jake's, then as Charlie's and occasionally Alan's adept, incisive but money-hungry psychiatrist. Often when Charlie or Alan are just getting to the root of their problem, Dr. Freeman notes that the area is interesting, \"but, unfortunately, we're out of time\". She prides herself as a guesser and is quite sarcastic, especially with Charlie. A recurring gag is her frequent over-billing, once charging Charlie a full hour's fee ($200) for 5 minutes of consultation, and on another occasion while treating Alan for insomnia she billed him for an entire hour after he slept for 40 minutes of the session pointing out that ''she'' was awake. In one episode, she tells Charlie to open up and not hold anything back as her hourly fee comes to \"$7 a minute\". During her sessions with Jake, Dr. Freeman displays a rather quirky demeanor and is noted for her use of a cow hand puppet. She later has a session with Walden in season 9. It is implied that she (like her actress) is [[bisexual]], as after Walden hugs her, she remarks \"Hmph. Maybe I'm ''not'' gay.\" <ref>Season 9 episode \"The Squat and Hover\"</ref>\n\n=== Barry Foster ===\nBarry Foster ([[Clark Duke]], seasons 11\u201312), was the working partner of Walden's love interest at the time Nicole. He is a full grown man but due to his youthful looks, childish personality, and short stature \u2013 he is often mistaken to be a kid. After Nicole left Malibu to work for Google in San Francisco, Barry was left homeless and without a job. He moves in with Walden temporarily, until Walden decides he's had enough of people moving into his house so he found Barry an apartment. Barry idolizes Walden to the point it's borderline obsession. Nevertheless, Walden takes a liking to Barry and the two become good friends. Despite having his own place, Barry tends to spend most of his time at the beach house hanging out with Jenny (the two become best friends of sorts and are seen as a sort of a double act \u2013 similar to Jake and Eldridge), or eating their food. Jenny, Alan and Berta mistook him for Jake upon meeting him for the first time. Since his first appearance on the show, Barry's role gradually becomes more significant. Barry only makes one appearance in season 12. He is there when the birth mother of Walden and Alan's supposed child goes into labour and stays to be there with them. He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Eldridge McElroy ===\nEldridge McElroy ([[Graham Patrick Martin]], seasons 7\u20139), Jake's best friend whose mother Lyndsey ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]) dated Alan. Eldridge is a dim-witted drummer and somewhat of a troublemaker. In his first appearance at the end of season 7, he and Jake get into trouble after sneaking off to the beach with \"a few\" beers. Jake and Eldridge are often portrayed reinforcing one another's stupidity, and by season 9, have become chronic [[cannabis culture|stoners]]. While Jake and Eldridge are friends, the relationship between their parents briefly causes some friction, but their friendship survives and they decide to join the Army following their high school graduation. Eldridge is never seen or mentioned again by name after season 10 (where Jake mentions while talking to Alan about them talking about Lyndsey and his relationship), though in season 12, a drunk Lyndsey does make reference to her and Alan both having screwed-up kids.\n\n=== Ms. McMartin ===\nMs. McMartin ([[Maggie Lawson]], season 12), is the social worker who places Louis into Walden and Alan's care in the final season, when they get married in order to fool the system into adopting a child for Walden. Walden has an attraction to her which he finds hard to bury as he needs to act gay in order to successfully adopt. Eventually, Alan and Ms. McMartin copulate, but when Alan reunites with Lyndsey, Walden and Ms. McMartin sleep together. Though they initially decide to go their separate ways as they believed the romance was just in the heat of the moment and they weren't truly a thing, Walden decides he doesn't want to be alone forever and that he truly love Ms. McMartin. He then goes to ask for another chance, and after serenading her with [[Michael Bolton]], she accepts. While Alan once asked Ms. McMartin what her first name is, her response is not shown to the audience.  To show respect in Louis' presence, Alan and Walden continue to refer to her as Ms. McMartin.\n\n=== Gordon ===\nGordon ([[J.D. Walsh (actor)|J.D. Walsh]], seasons 1\u20134, 6\u20138), a pizza delivery driver who idolized Charlie. During the third season he has a brief relationship with Rose, who forces him to dress like Charlie and yell the latter's name during sex. After their break-up, he disappears from the show, but returned in season six, again delivering pizzas. He revealed how he became a millionaire on the stock market, got married and subsequently divorced and then lost all his money to his ex-wife, forcing him to return to pizza delivery. He looked up to Charlie, often calling him a genius and always addressing him as \"Mr. Harper\" rather than the more familiar \"Charlie\".  Charlie invariably orders pizza from Gordon's pizzeria for him to deliver, irrespective of the distance; including when subletting his own live-in girlfriend Chelsea's old apartment in the San Fernando Valley,<ref>Episode 6.22 \"Sir Lancelot's Litter Box\"</ref> and when camped out with Alan ''et al.'' in Lyndsey's burned-out house<ref>Episode 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\"</ref> twenty miles from the beach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Gordon is unaware that Alan briefly dated Rose after his own relationship with her.<ref>When Charlie introduces Gordon to Alan's ex-wife's new husband Herb and Alan's girlfriend's ex-husband Chris in ep. 8.4 \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\" Gordon mistakenly offers that he has not had sex with anyone in Alan's life.</ref> Since he never appeared again after Season 8, it will always remain unknown if he knows that Charlie had gone missing.\n\n=== Herb Melnick ===\nDr. Herbert \"Herb\" Melnick ([[Ryan Stiles]], season 2, 4\u201310, 12) portrays Judith's goofy, train-hobbyist, pediatrician second husband and Jake's stepfather. He first appeared as Judith's date in Season 2's \"Enjoy Those Garlic Balls,\" but due to an inconsistency in the storyline, he was initially referred to as \"Greg Melnick.\" Not particularly happily married to uptight Judith, he is laid-back and gets along with the Harper brothers, whose lifestyles he appears to envy at times\u2014such as Charlie's partying and the fact that Alan was married to Kandi and later dates neighborhood MILF (and former soft-core porn actress) Lyndsey McElroy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Episode 8.1, \"Three Girls and a Guy Named Bud\"</ref> He finally achieves his dream of dating Lyndsey in the twelfth season.<ref>Episode 12.9 \"Bouncy, Bouncy, Bouncy, Lyndsey\"</ref> He and the other men in Judith's neighborhood similarly idolize Lyndsey's ex-husband Chris for repeatedly seducing the babysitter.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Episode 8.4, \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\"</ref> He has stated that he likes spending time with the Harpers, and called Charlie \"a little loosie-goosie with the liquor and the ladies, but all-in-all a good fella\" (which did not impress Judith). In the Season 6 finale, Judith gives birth to their daughter, whom they name Millie Melnick. However, Herb does not know that Judith had a brief affair with Alan around the time Millie was conceived, and remains in the dark about the fact that Alan could possibly be Millie's biological father. Single for most of his life, Herb's hobbies center on gardening,<ref name=\"Episode 5.13 The Soil is Moist\">Episode 5.13 \"The Soil is Moist\"</ref> his large model train layout,<ref>Episode 6.7 \"Best H.O. Money Can Buy\"</ref> and \"accidentally\" bumping into Lyndsey every morning.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Sexually, he is particularly adept at cunnilingus.<ref name=\"Episode 5.13 The Soil is Moist\"/> In season ten, Herb has an affair with his receptionist and Judith leaves him; he keeps the house (Alan's former house). After she leaves him Alan lives with him briefly after he and Walden have a fight, but tries to keep Alan as he is lonely without Judith. He begins to party out of control to get over Judith, so Walden and Alan call Judith to try and calm him down (a rare moment of Alan and Judith working together). Herb and Judith then reluctantly get back together and Herb returns to normalcy.\n\nHerb does not make a single appearance in Season 11. In the episode \"Cab Fare and a Bottle of Pencillin\", it is implied that he and Judith have separated for a third time and have possibly divorced, as he is nowhere to be seen at his and Judith's house. He returns in season 12 when Walden calls him, Barry and Larry over to celebrate that he and Alan will be adopting a child. He is there with Walden and Alan when the birth mother goes into labour and decides to stay with them because he wanted to be there to support them. Notably, Herb does not appear in the series finale, nor is there any mention of him.\n\n=== Judge Linda Harris ===\nJudge Linda Harris ([[Ming-Na Wen]], season 5), Charlie's main love interest of the fifth season. Charlie and Linda met through Alan, and his girlfriend Donna. Charlie and Linda's first date doesn't go as planned, but Charlie gets himself arrested in order to see Linda at court. Linda agrees to give Charlie another chance. Linda and Charlie start to get serious, but their relationship is in trouble when Charlie starts to see Rose's face on every woman he sees. Charlie flies to London to see Rose, but when he learns that Rose is ready to start a family, Charlies flees London and continues his relationship with Linda. Charlie learns that he is good with kids when he meets Linda's son, Brandon. Charlie makes Brandon a mix tape of kid's songs, and when Linda's ex-husband hears them, he offers Charlie a job as a kid's singer. When Linda is awarded as \"Judge of the Year\", she takes Charlie to a function that celebrates her. Evelyn accidentally gives Charlie the wrong pill that instead of calming him down, it makes him act crazy. After being humiliated at the function, Linda breaks up with Charlie.\n\n=== Kate ===\nKate ([[Brooke D'Orsay]], season 10\u201311), Walden's ex-girlfriend and main love interest of season ten. Walden decides he wants to come up with a new persona so he can meet a girl who isn't after his money. Walden pretends to be the make believe Sam Wilson. Walden and Kate meet at the department store where she works. Walden (as \"Sam\") and Kate go on a few dates and Kate meets Alan, \"Sam's\" landlord and she hates him. Kate tells Walden that he can move in with her and he agrees. They also spend Christmas together. Walden has Alan invest in Kate's fashion line with Walden's money and Kate goes to New York to host her fashion show. Walden feels depressed with Kate gone and he gains a lot of weight. Alan helps Walden lose it and they fly to New York so Walden can tell Kate who he is. Kate gets furious and breaks up with him but later realizes that Walden helped her get her fashion show so she forgives him but they remain broken up since Kate has to stay in New York. Kate returns three episodes later and Walden spends Valentine's Day with her. They are forced to break up due to their busy schedules. It is revealed to the audience that Rose is Kate's new fashion line investor (Walden and Alan are ignorant of Rose's involvement, and Kate is unaware of Rose's connection to them and her psychosis). She returns in the season 11 episode \"West Side Story\" inviting Walden to her boutique opening. They then have dinner in the restaurant where they had their first date agreeing not to have sex afterwards, but they end up in bed and right when they are about to have sex, they both get food poisoning from the fish they ate at the restaurant. In the following episode \"Lan Mao Shi Zai Wuding Shang\", Kate goes to San Francisco for a few days and Walden was planning on proposing to her when she got back. He then meets a woman named Vivian and falls for her. He tells Kate when she gets back and they break up for good. She is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Larry Martin ===\nLarry Martin ([[D. B. Sweeney]], season 11\u201312), was Lyndsey's boyfriend after she and Alan broke up. However Lyndsey began cheating on Larry with Alan because he was apparently bad in bed. Alan thinks that he and Lyndsey will get back together, but Lyndsey says she likes all the qualities Larry has that Alan doesn't and therefore only wants the relationship with Alan to be sexual. To find out more about Larry, Alan created a pseudonym of \"Jeff Strongman\". Larry and \"Jeff\" hit it off and eventually become best friends. Larry attends a gym and helps out with charities, but he is very naive and later on develops into an \"idiot\" character. He has a sister, Gretchen ([[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]]), whom he sets up with Jeff. He proposes to Lyndsey halfway through the season just as Alan was about to. Lyndsey says yes to Larry and Larry asks Jeff to be his best man, much to the chagrin of Lyndsey who is irritated by Alan's close friendship with Larry. Larry seems to have no shame as he doesn't mind listening to Jeff and his sister having sex in the next room. It can be argued that he is the most important recurring character in the eleventh season, as the overarching storyline for the season revolves around his relationships with Alan and Lyndsey. When Alan reveals who he truly is to Larry, he initially struggles to understand. When the realization hits him, Larry cancels his wedding with Lyndsey. He attends Alan and Gretchen's wedding, making it clear that he blames Lyndsey not Alan. However, when Walden accidentally reveals to him that Alan was cheating with Lyndsey, Larry goes to confront Alan, only for Walden to push Larry off of the deck of the beach house. He returns in the season 12 episode \"Thirty-Eight, Sixty-Two, Thirty-Eight\", surprisingly still good friends with Alan and Walden. Walden calls him, Herb and Barry over to celebrate the fact that he and Alan will be receiving a child. However, he is confused by that fact and believes that one of the two men will be having the baby. He is there with them when the birth mother goes into labour as he wanted to be there with them, saying \"to raise a child it takes the Village People\". He is never seen or mentioned again after this episode.\n\n=== Lyndsey McElroy ===\nLyndsey McElroy ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]], season 7\u201312), Alan's on-again/off-again girlfriend in the later seasons, the mother of Jake's best friend, Eldridge ([[Graham Patrick Martin]]), and \u2013 to her extreme consternation \u2013 the daughter of Evelyn's lover, Jean ([[Georgia Engel]]). Years ago, she was featured in a soft-core porn movie, ''Cinnamon's Buns''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> She and Eldridge live in the San Fernando Valley, across the street from Judith, Herb, Jake, and Millie.<ref>Episode 8.4, \"Hookers, Hookers, Hookers\".</ref> She divorced her husband Chris after discovering his affair with their babysitter.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Alan began dating Lyndsey at the end of season 7, and their relationship was initially kept a secret from their sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/02/courtney-thorne-smith-woos-one-of-two-and-a-half-men.html|title=Courtney Thorne-Smith woos one of 'Two and a Half Men'|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223044804/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/02/courtney-thorne-smith-woos-one-of-two-and-a-half-men.html|archivedate=2010-02-23}}</ref> They have since had several breakups and reunions. In the Season 9 episode \"One False Move, Zimbabwe!\", Alan says Lyndsey is dating someone else, a fact later confirmed when he meets her very young (and rich, and handsome) boyfriend and is misled into thinking he could reunite with her. However, Lyndsey later breaks up with the boyfriend and tells Alan she wants to resume dating him; he is initially happy, then somewhat downcast when she explains that she had to work too hard to look sexy and cover up her bodily functions to keep the young guy, and she can forget about all that with Alan because he's not going to find anyone else. Alan later tells Jake that he and Lyndsey are dating but have absolutely no intention of getting married. They however get engaged in the season ten episode \"Something My Gynecologist Said\". This does not deter Lyndsey from having sex with Alan's ex-wife Kandi when Kandi attempts to reconcile with Alan. Later, in season ten, Lyndsey breaks up with Alan again and begins dating a man named Nick. Nick is unseen, though Alan spies on him and Lyndsey and hears them having loud sex. As season eleven begins, it is unknown what happened to Nick, but Lyndsey reveals she is dating another man who turns out to be Larry Martin. She still keeps Alan around for sex only, revealing that Larry is lousy in bed but that she likes all of his other qualities. Larry eventually proposes to Lyndsey and she accepts, but the wedding is cancelled when Larry learns of Alan's true identity and that Lyndsey cheated. Lyndsey returns early in season twelve after 60 days in alcohol rehab, only to find out that Alan married Walden. She immediately gets drunk and goes to Alan, suggesting that they resume their sex-only relationship. In the last few episodes, she is planning on moving away until she gets back together with Alan and accepts his marriage proposal after seeing the huge engagement ring that Walden purchased for Alan to give to Lyndsey. In the final episode, Alan telephones Lyndsey to inform her that should anything happen to him, she was the love of his life (since he currently fears the wrath of a very-alive Charlie). Though she tells him she loves him, she is in a pawn shop selling Alan's engagement ring behind his back.\n\n=== Megan ===\nMegan ([[Macey Cruthird]], seasons 8\u20139), Jake's math tutor and brief girlfriend. Jake develops a crush on Megan in season eight, but she does not reciprocate the feelings. In season nine, Megan falls for Walden which makes Jake jealous. After realizing she has no chance with Walden, she settles for Jake and they start dating. When Alan is sent to a mental hospital, he has a nightmare that Jake gets Megan pregnant but in reality, Jake reveals that he and Megan never had sex, but he plans to that evening. It is assumed they broke up as Jake had sex with an older woman in \"Not In My Mouth!\"\n\n=== Melissa ===\nMelissa ([[Kelly Stables]], seasons 6\u20138), Alan's receptionist who briefly dated Charlie before starting a relationship with Alan. She broke off the relationship after discovering Alan in bed with her mother (Alan was under the influence of marijuana, provided by Melissa's mother). The two reconcile and begin dating again, but Alan's cheapness and lack of a private area for them to make love causes a second breakup. She reappeared in Alan's life in the second episode of season 8 (\"A Bottle of Wine and a Jackhammer\"), complicating Alan's relationship with Lyndsey. Alan and she had a bad breakup and she violently forced Charlie to reveal Alan's location with Lyndsey, but she never showed up there, wasn't a factor in Alan and Lyndsey's breakup at the time, and has not been seen since. She was mentioned in \"A Giant Cat Holding a Churro\" when Alan was sharing his secrets with Lyndsey, saying he \"cheated on her with an old girlfriend.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/shows/two-and-a-half-men/episodes/season_8/a-bottle-of-wine-and-a-jackhammer |title=Two and a Half Men Season 8 Episode 2 |publisher=TV Fanatic |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mia ===\nMia ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], season 3 recurring, seasons 5\u20137, 9, 12), a ballet teacher whom Charlie Harper fell in love with during the [[Two and a Half Men (season 3)|third season]]. She got him to clean up his act by not drinking or smoking as much, not wearing bowling shirts as well as not eating meat. However, he breaks up with her after he becomes fed up with the way she was trying to control his behavior. She then takes a job in [[New York City]]. She returns towards the end of the third season when her dancing group comes to town, and she asks Charlie for his sperm so she can have a baby. He attempts but fails, and he then proposes marriage to her, in which she accepts. Initially, Alan was their wedding planner, however after a big blowout with Mia's parents, they agree to go to Las Vegas and elope. Just as they are about to be married, Mia implies that Alan and Jake will be moving out after they wed, and Charlie refuses to throw out his family. They break off the engagement and she leaves. Mia returns in the fifth season when Charlie sees that she is marrying another man, and he attempts to win her back, but her father punches him out. She returns again the sixth and seventh seasons after her divorce in hopes that Charlie will help her with a new-found singing career. She's a terrible singer. Charlie then has to choose between Mia and his then-fianc\u00e9e Chelsea. After much consideration, Charlie chooses Chelsea and abandons Mia at the recording studio. Mia also makes a brief guest appearance in the ninth season premi\u00e8re at Charlie's funeral. In the final episode, Mia gets a letter of apology from Charlie for having an affair with her sister, along with a large check. When she sees the amount, she says \"Screw my sister\", presumably forgiving him.\n\n=== Robin Schmidt ===\nRobin Schmidt ([[Mimi Rogers]], season 9\u201312), the [[primatologist]] mother of Walden Schmidt. Robin is on the board of directors at Walden's company along with Walden, Bridget, and later Alan. Robin raised Walden from birth until he was four with a baby gorilla to study the differences of the growth between humans and monkeys. Walden spends Christmas in season nine with Robin. Robin is quite wealthy and has a good relationship with both Bridget and Zoey. Robin teamed up with Bridget to get Walden kicked off the board of directors because she felt he was using money irresponsibly (Even going so far as to give Alan a \"[[handjob|happy ending]]\" in the men's room of a bar to accomplish this). In season 11 she appeared at a fund-raiser with [[Lynda Carter]], and at the end of the episode it is implied she had a threesome with Jenny and Lynda.

Teddy first appears in the season four finale and maintains a recurring role halfway through season five where he and Evelyn become engaged and married. On their wedding day, right after being married, Teddy is found with his pants down, dead on Charlie's bed. It appears Courtney wasn't his daughter but his partner; their real names were Nathan Krunk and Sylvia Fishman. Teddy is Evelyn's fifth deceased husband, although their marriage was not consummated before he widowed her. His [[catchphrase]] was, \"terrific\".\n\n=== Zoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce ===\nZoey Hyde-Tottingham-Pierce ([[Sophie Winkleman]], seasons 9\u201310), the British girlfriend of Walden Schmidt up until the second episode of season 10.

In the season ten episode \"Ferrets, Attack!\", Zoey attempts to reconcile with Walden but she finds out he has moved in with Rose; in truth Rose moved her things into Walden's house without permission. Walden leaves Rose for Zoey, but Zoey no longer wants him as she is mad that he and Rose became serious. She has not been seen since and only briefly mentioned twice. In the final episode, Walden calls Zoey and discovers she has married well and is being crowned Queen of Moldavia.\n\n=== Marty Pepper ===\nMarty Pepper ([[Carl Reiner]], seasons 7\u20138, 11), Evelyn's much older boyfriend, a retired TV producer. Evelyn first invites him round to Charlie's house when she goes to visit. He believes Alan and Charlie to be gay and Jake to be their adopted son, which he quips would make a great sitcom. This becomes the premise of season 12 of the show with Alan and Walden marrying to adopt a child. He gives the boys advice on how to score with women, telling them to say to a woman that he will give her, her own sitcom. He reappeared in season 11 in multiple episodes. He meets Evelyn's newly found granddaughter but does not like her living with them when Walden throws her out of his house as she is receiving all of Evelyn's attention, leaving no time for sex between them. He initially mistakes Evelyn inviting Jenny to stay as a sexual reason as he had never done a grandmother/grandchild combination before. He believes Walden and Alan to be gay and ask the minister to marry them at his and Evelyn's wedding. He puts Walden and Alan in charge of his stag party, but it ends in disaster and he breaks off the engagement as he does not want to be tied down, but he eventually resumes the marriage and becomes Evelyn's sixth husband with Walden and Alan as his best men. He believes Walden to be one of Evelyn's sons and prefers him over Alan, as most people do. He and Evelyn reportedly have an \"open marriage\", in that they can sleep with other people, as Evelyn does on at least 2 occasions following the wedding. In his original appearance (\"Warning, It's Dirty\") the character was slightly different, he spoke with a slight lisp and out of one side of his mouth.
