The timeless, cleansing rain evoked by James\u2019 paintings is artificial. The viewer can encounter the work through a meditative fascination with its lucid intricacy \u2013 the eternal and universal behavior of water. And the aesthetic pleasure of this is intense. But to read it as only beautiful or mystical is to miss the logic of contradiction that gives the work its conceptual strength, the spray of toxic industrial paint onto an object recognizable to any old-master artist\u2019s apprentice. Therefore, in a larger sense, this work presents an argument for combination and exchange over homogeneity and conformity. James\u2019 new mode of painting can be read as a critique of easy simulation, of virtuality, in relation to both traditional illusionism and the digital. By layering contrasting material processes to create a seeming unity, a surface of streaming water, these works insist on the real over the hyperreal and on the assembled, heterogeneous, contested nature of that reality.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://there-there.co/therethere-exhibitions|title=exhibitions|website=there-there|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n'''Neons, 2002-present'''\n\nColorful rings of neon nod to the ancient concept of the universe as set of concentric planetary orbits.

But I would argue that they are also drawing from the collective human experience. As much as there is room for individual creativity, every artist is also transcending collective memory. Artists can create new morphic fields. Yet, all art exists within a morphic field beyond the individual.\u201d<ref>Katja Eichinger, \u201cAn Interview with Rupert Sheldrake\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 52-57.</ref> The sculptures are created from found materials and \u201cthrough [James\u2019] process of converting...waste into bronze they morph into something very beautiful and precious.\u201d<ref>Matthias Muhling, \u201cAn Interview with Anthony James\u201d, Morphic Fields, Munich: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2014, pp. 77-89.</ref>\n\n'''Shields, 2016-Present'''\n\nShields was an exhibition of curved disks made of brass, bronze, and steel \u201cscarred with [[Minimalism|minimalist]] markings.\u201d This series \u201coperates elusively, staggering between the iconic and the arbitrary, the concrete and the alchemic, the mythical and experiential.\u201d<ref> Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref> James describes his work as, \u201cevoking pictorial depictions of the [[cosmos]], alluding to notions of mysticism, ethereality, and science fiction, all the while anchored through the use of weighty, industrial materials such as metal.\"<ref> Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref> The shields \u201cread as relics or artifacts from some liminal moment, as such, James attempts to locate beauty in the wake of insanity.\u201d<ref>Fort Gansevoort, https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ee2fc1e4b0c1020ff7e01a/t/591f29c103596e77e94503c7/1495214536115/FG_AnthonyJames_PressRelease_FINAL.pdf, \u201cAnthony James/Fabulism\u201d, 2017.</ref>\n\n'''Rain Paintings, 2018'''\n\nA photorealistic series made of contradictory materials: Belgian linen, gesso, and [https://www.ppgdeltron.com Deltron]. \u201cPurity is an illusion. The timeless, cleansing rain evoked by James\u2019 paintings is artificial. The viewer can encounter the work through a meditative fascination with its lucid intricacy \u2013 the eternal and universal behavior of water. And the aesthetic pleasure of this is intense. But to read it as only beautiful or mystical is to miss the logic of contradiction that gives the work its conceptual strength, the spray of toxic industrial paint onto an object recognizable to any old-master artist\u2019s apprentice. Therefore, in a larger sense, this work presents an argument for combination and exchange over homogeneity and conformity. James\u2019 new mode of painting can be read as a critique of easy simulation, of virtuality, in relation to both traditional illusionism and the digital. By layering contrasting material processes to create a seeming unity, a surface of streaming water, these works insist on the real over the hyperreal and on the assembled, heterogeneous, contested nature of that reality.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://there-there.co/therethere-exhibitions|title=exhibitions|website=there-there|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n'''Neons, 2002-present'''\n\nColorful rings of neon nod to the ancient concept of the universe as set of concentric planetary orbits.

Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity.

A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios.

This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied. ''10'' was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1979 Movies at the Domestic Box Office|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1979|publisher=Nash Information Services LLC|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''10,'' Derek was cast in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that featured [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]].

It is magnified and split into multiple images by the [[gravitational lens]]ing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It appears to be a giant [[elliptical galaxy]] with a [[supermassive black hole]] and associated [[accretion disk]]. It possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with [[starburst region|starburst]] activity.\n\n==Gravitational lensing==\n\nAPM 08279+5255 was initially identified as a quasar in 1998 during an Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) survey to find [[carbon star]]s in the [[galactic halo]]. The combination of its high [[redshift]] (z=3.87) and brightness (particularly in the infrared) made it the most [[luminosity|luminous]] object yet seen in the universe. It was suspected of being a gravitationally lensed object, with its luminosity magnified.<ref name=Irwin1998 /> Observations in the infrared with the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS]] high-resolution camera on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) showed that the source was composed of three discrete images. Even accounting for the magnification, the quasar is an extremely powerful object, with a luminosity of 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> times the luminosity of the sun.<ref name=Ibata1999 /> Subsequent observations with the Hubble [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] confirmed the presence of a third faint image between the two brighter images. Each component has the same spectral energy distribution and is an image of the quasar. Gravitational lensed systems with odd numbers of images are extremely rare; most contain two or four.<ref name=Lewis2002 />\n\nInitially the magnification due to gravitational lensing was thought to be large, in the range of 40 to 90 times.<ref name=Irwin1998 /><ref name=Ibata1999 /> After detailed observations at many wavelengths, the best model of the lensing galaxy is a tilted [[spiral galaxy]]. This gives a magnification of about 4. The additional observations led to a revised redshift of 3.911.<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\n== Galactic structure ==\nAPM 08279+5255 is a bright source at almost all wavelengths and has become one of the most studied of distant sources. Using [[astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] it has been mapped in [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] with the [[AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer]] on the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], in [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] with the Hubble Space Telescope, and in [[Radio astronomy|radio]] with the [[Very Long Baseline Array]]. Measurements with the [[Institut de radioastronomie millim\u00e9trique|IRAM]] [[Plateau de Bure Interferometer]] and other instruments looked at the distribution of molecules such as [[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[cyanide|CN]], [[hydrogen cyanide#HCN in space|HCN]], and HCO+ as well as atomic [[carbon]].<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\nFrom these observations APM 08279+5255 is a giant elliptical galaxy with large amounts of gas and dust and an [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) at its core. The AGN is radio-quiet with no evidence for a [[relativistic jet]].  It is powered by one of the [[List of most massive black holes|largest known]] supermassive black holes: 23 billion solar masses (based on the molecular disk velocities<ref name=Riechers2009 />); or alternatively 10 billion solar masses (based on [[reverberation mapping]]<ref name=\"saturni2016\"/>).  The black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk of material spiraling into it, a few [[parsec]]s in size. Further out is a dust torus, a doughnut shaped cloud of dust and gas with a radius of about 100 parsecs. Both the accretion disk and dust torus appear to be almost face-on to us.<ref name=Riechers2009 /> The radiation from the molecular gas is coming from a flattened disk at the center of the galaxy with a radius of 550 pc. This is also the [[starburst region]] of the galaxy. The gas is heated both by activity in the AGN and by the newly forming stars.<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\nAPM is an [[Luminous infrared galaxy#ULIRG|ultra-luminous infrared galaxy]] (ULIRG). Its high redshift shifts the far-infrared spectrum into [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wavelengths]] where it can be observed from observatories on the ground.

It is magnified and split into multiple images by the [[gravitational lens]]ing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It appears to be a giant [[elliptical galaxy]] with a [[supermassive black hole]] and associated [[accretion disk]]. It possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with [[starburst region|starburst]] activity.\n\n==Gravitational lensing==\n\nAPM 08279+5255 was initially identified as a quasar in 1998 during an Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) survey to find [[carbon star]]s in the [[galactic halo]]. The combination of its high [[redshift]] (z=3.87) and brightness (particularly in the infrared) made it the most [[luminosity|luminous]] object yet seen in the universe. It was suspected of being a gravitationally lensed object, with its luminosity magnified.<ref name=Irwin1998 /> Observations in the infrared with the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS]] high-resolution camera on board the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) showed that the source was composed of three discrete images. Even accounting for the magnification, the quasar is an extremely powerful object, with a luminosity of 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> times the luminosity of the sun.<ref name=Ibata1999 /> Subsequent observations with the Hubble [[Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph]] confirmed the presence of a third faint image between the two brighter images. Each component has the same spectral energy distribution and is an image of the quasar. Gravitational lensed systems with odd numbers of images are extremely rare; most contain two or four.<ref name=Lewis2002 />\n\nInitially the magnification due to gravitational lensing was thought to be large, in the range of 40 to 90 times.<ref name=Irwin1998 /><ref name=Ibata1999 /> After detailed observations at many wavelengths, the best model of the lensing galaxy is a tilted [[spiral galaxy]]. This gives a magnification of about 4. The additional observations led to a revised redshift of 3.911.<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\n== Galactic structure ==\nAPM 08279+5255 is a bright source at almost all wavelengths and has become one of the most studied of distant sources. Using [[astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] it has been mapped in [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] with the [[AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer]] on the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], in [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] with the Hubble Space Telescope, and in [[Radio astronomy|radio]] with the [[Very Long Baseline Array]]. Measurements with the [[Institut de radioastronomie millim\u00e9trique|IRAM]] [[Plateau de Bure Interferometer]] and other instruments looked at the distribution of molecules such as [[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[cyanide|CN]], [[hydrogen cyanide#HCN in space|HCN]], and HCO+ as well as atomic [[carbon]].<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\nFrom these observations APM 08279+5255 is a giant elliptical galaxy with large amounts of gas and dust and an [[active galactic nucleus]] (AGN) at its core. The AGN is radio-quiet with no evidence for a [[relativistic jet]].  It is powered by one of the [[List of most massive black holes|largest known]] supermassive black holes: 23 billion solar masses (based on the molecular disk velocities<ref name=Riechers2009 />); or alternatively 10 billion solar masses (based on [[reverberation mapping]]<ref name=\"saturni2016\"/>).  The black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk of material spiraling into it, a few [[parsec]]s in size. Further out is a dust torus, a doughnut shaped cloud of dust and gas with a radius of about 100 parsecs. Both the accretion disk and dust torus appear to be almost face-on to us.<ref name=Riechers2009 /> The radiation from the molecular gas is coming from a flattened disk at the center of the galaxy with a radius of 550 pc. This is also the [[starburst region]] of the galaxy. The gas is heated both by activity in the AGN and by the newly forming stars.<ref name=Riechers2009 />\n\nAPM is an [[Luminous infrared galaxy#ULIRG|ultra-luminous infrared galaxy]] (ULIRG). Its high redshift shifts the far-infrared spectrum into [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wavelengths]] where it can be observed from observatories on the ground. In 2008 and 2009 the intensities of its [[water vapor]] [[spectral line]]s were measured using the millimeter wave spectrometer Z-Spec at the [[Caltech Submillimeter Observatory]]. Comparing the spectrum to that of [[Markarian 231]], another ULIRG, showed that it had 50 times the water vapor of that galaxy.<ref name=Bradford2011 /> This made it the largest mass of water in the known universe\u2014100 trillion times more water than that held in all of Earth's oceans combined. Its discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the known universe for nearly its entire existence; the radiation was emitted 1.6 billion years after the [[Big Bang]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/apm_082795255_largest_water_mass_universe_so_far-81124 |title=APM 08279+5255 - The Largest Water Mass In The Universe (So Far) |work=Science 2.0 |publisher=ION Publishing |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bradford2011>{{cite journal |first1=C.

[[MacArthur Boulevard (Washington, D.C.)|MacArthur Boulevard]] (once called Conduit Road) is the main thoroughfare that passes through the Palisades.\n\nIn 1893, this subdivision was laid out by the Palisades Improvement Company. The Palisades had the Great Falls Electric Railway that ran from 36th and Prospect streets out to Glen Echo. The International Athletic Park and Amusement Company secured a large block of the Palisades and constructed a Bicycle Track and General Amusement Park, which opened on Decoration Day in 1896. Also encompassed within the Palisades is the neighborhood of Potomac Heights, which is bounded by Loughboro Road at the north end, Arizona Avenue at the south end and MacArthur Boulevard and the Potomac River.\n\n==History==\nIn June 1909, the Potomac Heights Land Co. (based in North Carolina) acquired {{convert|75|acre|m2}} previously known as the Athletic Park tract at the reported cost of $1000 an acre. The tract extends parallel with and between Conduit Road and the Potomac. It is divided by the Washington Railway and Electric Company, which ran from Georgetown to Glen Echo for a 5 cent fare. There were 800 lots at $450\u2013$500 per lot and no home was to be erected at less than $2500.\n\nThe Palisades is part of [[Advisory Neighborhood Commission]] 3D in Ward 3, the far northwest corner of the [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest Quadrant]] just north of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. The current Palisades Citizens Association (PCA) was started as the Conduit Road Citizens Association in 1916.\n\n[[File:MacArthur Theater - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|left|The old MacArthur Theater, now used as a [[CVS/pharmacy]], in the Palisades]]\nThe Palisades is one of the lesser-known neighborhoods in Washington, with a mixture of detached houses, townhouses and apartments. The homes along the bluff on Potomac Avenue offer a broad view of the Potomac River and the [[Virginia]] riverfront, with often impressive sunset views.\n\nSince 1928, the Palisades has been served by the Francis Scott Key Elementary School, which is part of the [[DC Public Schools]]. Extensive capital improvement of Key Elementary was completed in fall 2003. The renovated and expanded school currently enrolls 285 students and will gradually increase to approximately 300. \n[[File:Arizona Avenue Railway Bridge - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|Arizona Avenue Railway Bridge, part of the [[Capital Crescent Trail]], crosses the [[C&O Canal]] in the Palisades]]\nThe current [[Palisades Neighborhood Library]] opened in 1964 and was renovated in 2018.\n\n[[Battery Kemble Park|Battery Kemble]] was at an elevation on Ridge Road (now Nebraska Avenue). The battery held two 100-pounder Parrott rifles, placed to sweep Chain Bridge and Virginia beyond. The site is located within [[Battery Kemble Park]], bounded by Chain Bridge Road, MacArthur Boulevard, 49th Street, and Nebraska Avenue, NW.\n\n[[Fletcher's Cove]] is on the Potomac River and the C & O Canal National Historical Park, between Chain and Key Bridges. Fletcher's has been in this location since the 1850s and is renowned as a superb fishing and recreational area. The nearby Abner Cloud House is the oldest building on the canal, dating back to 1802. After 145 years of business, the fourth generation of Fletchers retired in 2004 and Guest Services Incorporated, a National Park Service concessionaire, assumed responsibility for the operation of the concessions. The area surrounding the boat house was then officially named Fletcher's Cove, though most people still call it Fletcher's Boat House.\n\nOther notable landmarks making the Palisades unique are the old Conduit Road Schoolhouse on MacArthur Boulevard, Palisades Community Church (1923), The Lab School of Washington (1967) (formerly the Florence Crittenton Home for Unwed Mothers), the German Embassy, St. David's Episcopal Church (1940), Sibley Hospital (1961) and Gen. Montgomery C. Meig's Washington Aqueduct/ Delcarlia Filtration/ Water Treatment Plant (1853).\n\nRemnants are everywhere of the old Capitol Transit #20 trolley (Union Station to Cabin John) that was a very popular ride thRough the Palisades out to the Glen Echo Amusement Park (1898\u20131968).  In addition, the Georgetown Branch of the B & O railroad once worked its way through The Palisades, the most notable landmark being the steel trestle bridge over Arizona Ave.  Since the Georgetown Branch's abandonment in 1985, it has been part of the [[Capital Crescent Trail]].   \n\nThe [[Engine Company 29|Palisades Firehouse (Engine Company 29)]], at 4811 MacArthur Blvd. NW, built in 1925 is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It was designed by architect [[Albert L. Harris]] in [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] style. \n\nAlso National Register-listed are:\n*[[Conduit Road Schoolhouse]]\n*[[Dr. Franklin E. Kameny House]], ordinary-looking home of gay rights leader\n*[[Northwest No. 4 Boundary Marker of the Original District of Columbia]]\n*[[Washington Aqueduct]].\n\nDesigned by John J. Zink, the MacArthur Theater, originally a single 1,000 seater that was tri-plexed in 1982, was in use from December 1946 through March 1997.\n\nOn September 11, 1936, at a cost of $40,000, the Palisades Playground and field house was dedicated at its current Sherier and Edmunds Place location.\n\nThe Palisades neighborhood is the home for a variety of popular restaurants such as Figs, Makoto, Bambu, Bistro Aracosia, BlackSalt, Chen's Gourmet, Seventh Hill Pizza, Kotobuki, DC Boathouse, Et Voila' and the new Salt and Pepper Restaurant, and its very own pet supply store, Profeed of DC.\n\nA high point of the year for many in the neighborhood is the annual July 4 parade, featuring local bands, fire engines and children on highly decorated tricycles and bicycles.\n\n==Education==\n[[District of Columbia Public Schools]] operates public schools.

In 1889, sensing he had a potential new star on his hands, Hoyt offered her a five-year contract, but Adams declined in favor of a lesser offer from the powerful producer [[Charles Frohman]] who, from that point forward, took control of her career.

Audiences came to see its star, Drew, but left remembering Adams. Most memorable was a scene in which her character feigned tipsiness for which she received a two-minute ovation on opening night. Drew was the star, but it was for Adams that the audience gave twelve curtain calls, and previously tepid critics gave generous reviews. ''Harpers Weekly'' wrote: \"It is difficult to see just who is going to prevent Miss Adams from becoming the leading exponent of light comedy in America.  ''The New York Times'' wrote that Adams, \"not John Drew, has made the success of ''The Masked Ball'' at Palmer's, and is the star of the comedy. Manager Charles Frohman, in attempting to exploit one star, has happened upon another of greater magnitude.\" The tipsy scene started Adams on her path to being a favorite among New York audiences and led to an eighteen-month run for the play.\n\nLess successful plays followed, including ''[[The Butterflies (play)|The Butterflies]]'', ''[[The Bauble Shop]]'', ''[[Christopher, Jr.]]'', ''[[The Imprudent Young Couple]]'' and ''[[The Squire of Dames]]''. But 1896 saw an upturn for Adams with ''Rosemary''.

At age 16, she made her Broadway debut, and under [[Charles Frohman]]'s management, she became a popular player alongside leading man [[John Drew Jr.]] in the early 1890s. Beginning in 1897, Adams starred in plays by [[J. M.

These productions made Adams the most popular actress in America.<ref>Marcosson and Frohman, p. 175</ref> She also performed in various other plays. Her last Broadway play, in 1916, was Barrie's ''[[A Kiss for Cinderella]]''. After a 13-year retirement, she appeared in more Shakespeare plays and then taught acting in Missouri.

She then became a member of [[E. H. Sothern]]'s theatre company in Boston, appearing in ''The Highest Bidder'', and then was on Broadway in ''[[Lord Chumley]]'' in 1888. [[Charles H. Hoyt]] then cast her in ''[[A Midnight Bell (play)|A Midnight Bell]]'' where audiences, if not the critics, took notice of her.  In 1889, sensing he had a potential new star on his hands, Hoyt offered her a five-year contract, but Adams declined in favor of a lesser offer from the powerful producer [[Charles Frohman]] who, from that point forward, took control of her career.  She soon left behind juvenile parts and began to play leading roles for Frohman,<ref name=Utah/> often alongside her mother.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/Person/View/29322 \"Annie Adams\"], [[Internet Broadway Database]], accessed January 20, 2016</ref> In 1890, Frohman asked [[David Belasco]] and [[Henry Churchill de Mille|Henry C. de Mille]] to specially write the part of Dora Prescott for Adams in their new play ''[[Men and Women (play)|Men and Women]]'', which Frohman was producing. The next year, she appeared as Nell in ''The Lost Paradise''.\n\nIn 1892, [[John Drew Jr.]] (one of the leading stars of the day) ended his 18-year association with [[Augustin Daly]] and joined Frohman's company. Frohman paired Adams and Drew in a series of plays beginning with ''[[The Masked Ball]]'' and ending with ''[[Rosemary (play)|Rosemary]]'' in 1896.

Audiences came to see its star, Drew, but left remembering Adams. Most memorable was a scene in which her character feigned tipsiness for which she received a two-minute ovation on opening night. Drew was the star, but it was for Adams that the audience gave twelve curtain calls, and previously tepid critics gave generous reviews. ''Harpers Weekly'' wrote: \"It is difficult to see just who is going to prevent Miss Adams from becoming the leading exponent of light comedy in America.  ''The New York Times'' wrote that Adams, \"not John Drew, has made the success of ''The Masked Ball'' at Palmer's, and is the star of the comedy. Manager Charles Frohman, in attempting to exploit one star, has happened upon another of greater magnitude.\" The tipsy scene started Adams on her path to being a favorite among New York audiences and led to an eighteen-month run for the play.\n\nLess successful plays followed, including ''[[The Butterflies (play)|The Butterflies]]'', ''[[The Bauble Shop]]'', ''[[Christopher, Jr.]]'', ''[[The Imprudent Young Couple]]'' and ''[[The Squire of Dames]]''. But 1896 saw an upturn for Adams with ''Rosemary''. A comedy about the failed elopement of a young couple, sheltered for the night by an older man (Drew), the play received critical praise and box office success.<ref name=\"manybooks.net\">{{cite web|url=http://manybooks.net/pages/marcossoni2614626146-8/128.html|title=Charles Frohman: Manager and Man pr 128}}</ref>\n\n==Barrie and stardom==\n[[File:The-Little-Minister-1897.jpg|thumb|left|Adams and [[Robert Edeson]] in the Broadway production of ''The Little Minister'' (1897)]]\n[[File:Maude Adams in The Little Minister.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for ''The Little Minister'' (1897)]]\n[[File:Mucha-Maud Adams as Joan of Arc-1909.jpg|thumb|upright|Adams as [[Joan of Arc]], painted by [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1909)]]\nFrohman had been pursuing [[J.

However, she also appeared in other works. In 1899, she portrayed Shakespeare's Juliet.  While audiences loved her in the role, selling out the sixteen performances in New York, the critics disliked it.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was followed by ''[[L'Aiglon]]'' in 1900, a French play about the life of [[Napoleon II of France]] in which Adams played the leading role, foreshadowing her portrayal of another male (Peter Pan) five years later.  The play had starred [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in Paris with enthusiastic reviews, but Adams's ''L'Aiglon'' received mixed reviews in New York. In 1909, she played Joan of Arc in [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]''.
