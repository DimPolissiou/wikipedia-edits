Though no author is mentioned in the Hebrew text of this psalm, Jewish tradition ascribes it to [[Moses]], with [[David]] compiling it in his [[Book of Psalms]]. The Greek Septuagint translation of the Old Testament attributes it to [[David]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/psa/91/1/s_569001|title=Psalm 91:1 (LXX) |website= Blue letter Bible}}</ref>\n\nThe psalm is a regular part of [[Jewish history|Jewish]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and Protestant liturgies. The complete psalm and selected verses have been set to music often, notably by [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who used verses for his motet ''[[Denn er hat seinen Engeln befohlen]]''. The psalm has been paraphrased in [[hymn]]s.\n\n==Background and themes==\nThe [[Midrash]] states that Psalm 91 was composed by [[Moses]] on the day he completed the building of the [[Tabernacle]] in the desert. The verses describe Moses' own experience entering the Tabernacle and being enveloped by the Divine cloud.{{sfn|Scherman|2003|p=380}} [[Midrash Tehillim]] and [[Zohar]] teach that Moses composed this psalm while ascending into the cloud hovering over [[Mount Sinai]], at which time he recited these words as protection from the angels of destruction.{{sfn|Kaplan|1990|p=187}}\n\nIn Jewish thought, Psalm 91 conveys the themes of God's protection and rescue from danger.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ravkooktorah.org/PSALM-91.htm |title=Psalm 91: Dwelling on High |first= Chanan|last=Morrison|year=2017|accessdate= September 15, 2018 |work= Rav Kook Torah}}</ref> The [[Talmud]] (''[[Shevu'ot]]'' 15b) calls this psalm the \"song of plagues\" (''shir shel pega'im'' or ''shir shel nega'im''), for \"one who recites it with faith in God will be helped by Him in time of danger\".{{sfn|Scherman|2003|p=380}} Since the times of the [[Geonim]], this psalm was recited to [[Apotropaic magic|drive away]] demons and evil spirits.{{sfn|Matt|2004|p=103}} According to [[midrash]]im, the psalm references many types of demons that threaten man, including the \"Terror\", \"Arrow\", \"Pestilence\", and \"Destruction\" mentioned in verses 5\u20136.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/demons-and-demonology|title=Jewish Concepts: Demons & Demonology|work= [[Jewish Virtual Library]]|year=2008|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref> The psalm was written in [[amulet]]s by both Jews and Christians from the [[Late Antique]] period.{{sfn|Kraus|2009|p= 139}}{{sfn|Schiffman|1992|p=39}}\n\nModern-day Christians see the psalm as a source of comfort and protection, even in times of suffering.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://bible.org/seriespage/god-protector-psalm-91|title=God the Protector (Psalm 91)|year=2018|accessdate= September 15, 2018|publisher= Bible.org}}</ref>\n\nVerse 13, in the [[King James Version]] \"Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet\", was the origin of the [[iconography]] of [[Christ treading on the beasts]], seen in the [[Late Antique]] period and revived in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art]].\n\n==Text==\n===Hebrew Bible version===\nFollowing is the Hebrew text of Psalm 91:\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!

From early childhood he was influenced by the hymns of [[Isaac Watts]] and [[Charles Wesley]] and was reared in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]. After starting school in [[Savannah, Georgia]], Frank Lebby Stanton found his education cut off by the [[American Civil War]].  At the age of 12 he became apprenticed to a printer, a position which allowed him to enter the newspaper business.  In 1887 he met Leone Josey while he was working for the ''[[Smithville, Georgia|Smithville News]]''; they married and, in 1888, moved to [[Rome, Georgia]], where Frank Lebby Stanton had received an offer from John Temple Graves to serve as night editor for the ''[[Rome, Georgia#News|Rome Tribune]]''. \nWith encouragement from [[Joel Chandler Harris]], Stanton in 1889 switched to the ''Atlanta Constitution'' (where for a few months he worked for [[Henry W. Grady]] prior to Grady's death), and began to focus more on writing editorials and columns, a newspaper role which he filled from then until Stanton's death in 1927.<ref>Harris and Stanton shared an office on the fifth floor of the ''Atlanta Constitution'' 's building.

His poems include a number which he wrote in dialect, a challenge for which he had special knack, such as \"[[Mighty Lak a Rose]]\" (which was set to music by [[Ethelbert Nevin]] [1862\u20131901]). The music for \"A Plantation Ditty\" (first line \"De gray owl sing fum de chimbly top\") by Stanton was composed by [[Sidney Homer]].<ref>Harry Colin Thorpe, [http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/homersidney.htm \"The Songs of Sidney Homer\"] in ''[[Musical Quarterly]]'', Vol. XVII (1931), pp. 47\u201373.</ref> Several of Stanton's ballads were set to music by [[Oley Speaks]].<ref>See the list in the [[:nl:Oley Speaks#Liederen|Speaks article in the Dutch Wikipedia.]]</ref> Possibly Stanton's most successful hit in [[popular music]] was his lyrics for the wildly selling 1901 [[parlor song]] \"[[Awearyin' for You]]\" for which [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] provided the familiar tune.<ref>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/s/fstanton/ Stanton information on Recmusic.org], which source also indicates that Nevin provided tunes for other Stanton poems including \"Necklace of Love\" (a.k.a. \"No Rubies of Red for My Lady\") and \"Sleeping and Dreaming\"; see also [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/n/nevin.html RecMusic's Ethelbert Nevin site.] Stanton's \"Just Awearyin' for You\" lyrics were also matched by composer [[Harry T.

Stanton's \"lengthy dedicatory ode\" had \"Behold to-day the meeting of the lands\" as its first line. Booker T. Washington's speech on the occasion (see \"[[Atlanta Exposition]]\") is considered one of the most prominent addresses in [[African American]] history and is often cited in the development of the then-unfolding disagreement between Booker T. Washington and [[W.E.B. Du Bois]].</ref> On 1916 February 23, the day after Stanton's 59th birthday, public schools throughout Georgia held commemorations of his achievements. Walker, in appointing Stanton Georgia's poet laureate, stated that no one had ever previously been appointed poet laureate of ''any'' southern state.<ref>Walker also used the phrase \"the Frank Lebby Stanton of Indiana\" to describe James Whitcomb Riley.{{Citation\n|first1=L.L.\n|last1=Perry\n|first2=Melton F.\n|last2=Wightman\n|title=Frank Lebby Stanton: Georgia's First Post Laureate\n|place=Atlanta\n|publisher=Georgia State Department of Education.\n|year=1938\n|pages=10, 26\u201327, 32}}</ref>\n[[File:Jacobs-Bond JUST AWEARYIN' FOR YOU cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanton wrote the lyrics of \"[[Just Awearyin' for You]]\" and [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] the music.<ref>\"Just Awearyin' for You\" was published by [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond & Son]] in 1901 as part of ''[[Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose]]''.

From early childhood he was influenced by the hymns of [[Isaac Watts]] and [[Charles Wesley]] and was reared in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]. After starting school in [[Savannah, Georgia]], Frank Lebby Stanton found his education cut off by the [[American Civil War]].  At the age of 12 he became apprenticed to a printer, a position which allowed him to enter the newspaper business.  In 1887 he met Leone Josey while he was working for the ''[[Smithville, Georgia|Smithville News]]''; they married and, in 1888, moved to [[Rome, Georgia]], where Frank Lebby Stanton had received an offer from John Temple Graves to serve as night editor for the ''[[Rome, Georgia#News|Rome Tribune]]''. \nWith encouragement from [[Joel Chandler Harris]], Stanton in 1889 switched to the ''Atlanta Constitution'' (where for a few months he worked for [[Henry W. Grady]] prior to Grady's death), and began to focus more on writing editorials and columns, a newspaper role which he filled from then until Stanton's death in 1927.<ref>Harris and Stanton shared an office on the fifth floor of the ''Atlanta Constitution'' 's building. Visitors to that office included Richard Malcolm Johnson, [[Hamlin Garland]], [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], [[Paul Hamilton Hayne]], [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A.

His poems include a number which he wrote in dialect, a challenge for which he had special knack, such as \"[[Mighty Lak a Rose]]\" (which was set to music by [[Ethelbert Nevin]] [1862\u20131901]). The music for \"A Plantation Ditty\" (first line \"De gray owl sing fum de chimbly top\") by Stanton was composed by [[Sidney Homer]].<ref>Harry Colin Thorpe, [http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/homersidney.htm \"The Songs of Sidney Homer\"] in ''[[Musical Quarterly]]'', Vol. XVII (1931), pp. 47\u201373.</ref> Several of Stanton's ballads were set to music by [[Oley Speaks]].<ref>See the list in the [[:nl:Oley Speaks#Liederen|Speaks article in the Dutch Wikipedia.]]</ref> Possibly Stanton's most successful hit in [[popular music]] was his lyrics for the wildly selling 1901 [[parlor song]] \"[[Awearyin' for You]]\" for which [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] provided the familiar tune.<ref>[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/s/fstanton/ Stanton information on Recmusic.org], which source also indicates that Nevin provided tunes for other Stanton poems including \"Necklace of Love\" (a.k.a. \"No Rubies of Red for My Lady\") and \"Sleeping and Dreaming\"; see also [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/n/nevin.html RecMusic's Ethelbert Nevin site.] Stanton's \"Just Awearyin' for You\" lyrics were also matched by composer [[Harry T.

Stanton's \"lengthy dedicatory ode\" had \"Behold to-day the meeting of the lands\" as its first line. Booker T. Washington's speech on the occasion (see \"[[Atlanta Exposition]]\") is considered one of the most prominent addresses in [[African American]] history and is often cited in the development of the then-unfolding disagreement between Booker T. Washington and [[W.E.B. Du Bois]].</ref> On 1916 February 23, the day after Stanton's 59th birthday, public schools throughout Georgia held commemorations of his achievements. Walker, in appointing Stanton Georgia's poet laureate, stated that no one had ever previously been appointed poet laureate of ''any'' southern state.<ref>Walker also used the phrase \"the Frank Lebby Stanton of Indiana\" to describe James Whitcomb Riley.{{Citation\n|first1=L.L.\n|last1=Perry\n|first2=Melton F.\n|last2=Wightman\n|title=Frank Lebby Stanton: Georgia's First Post Laureate\n|place=Atlanta\n|publisher=Georgia State Department of Education.\n|year=1938\n|pages=10, 26\u201327, 32}}</ref>\n[[File:Jacobs-Bond JUST AWEARYIN' FOR YOU cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanton wrote the lyrics of \"[[Just Awearyin' for You]]\" and [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] the music.<ref>\"Just Awearyin' for You\" was published by [[Carrie Jacobs-Bond & Son]] in 1901 as part of ''[[Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose]]''.
