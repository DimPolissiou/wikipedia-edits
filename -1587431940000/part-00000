According to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, indoor air is more polluted than outdoor air, and is in the top five human health risks. Such pollution could be caused by toxic chemicals and mold and could lead to asthma induced illnesses. Insulation in Eco-homes include draft exclusion, glazing, wall, roof insulation, and other nontoxic materials. By installing insulation not only are you paying less money for heating bills, but you are also reducing exposure to toxic materials such as the carcinogen formaldehyde found in manufactured wood. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Passive Solar Gain===\nIn the northern hemisphere, a south facing site will be a much better location than a north facing site because of access to sunlight and protection from the cold northerly wind. An eco-house starts life facing the Sun.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\nIdeally the site for the house should have a south westerly aspect and be protected from the north and east. It's not always possible to do this but there will usually be an opportunity to take advantage of the passive solar gain by having more glazing on either the front or the back of the building. Planting trees and creating wind breaks on the north and east sides of the site can enhanced the solar gain effect by protecting the house from the cold north easterly winds.\n\nHaving faced the house towards the Sun, high performance windows are used to draw in as much light and warmth as possible. Sunlight then floods into the house and any heat generated is retained by a highly insulated building shell, draught proof windows and doors and thermal mass within the building.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\n===Active Solar Gain===\n[[File:Solar panels on a roof.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Electricity Generating Solar Panels on Roof]]\nOrientation towards the Sun also means that active solar systems can be fitted, both solar water heating panels and electricity generating solar panels on the roofs, further adding to the free heat and electricity gained from the sun.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\n===Living Gain===\nLiving in the house also generates heat. Active human beings can produce as much heat as a one bar electric fire. Add to this heat from cooking, washing, lights etc. and you can begin to see how an eco-house could get too hot. Conventionally opening the windows reduces heat, but an eco-house design could include heat recovery ventilation systems.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\n===Heat Recovery Ventilation===\nThese systems extract the warm, moist air from bathrooms and kitchens and take the heat out of the stale, damp air before venting it outside. The heat recovery system transfers this collected heat to fresh air coming into the building and distributes it to the bedrooms and living rooms, which creates fresh air at room temperature. An added benefit is that filters can be fitted on the air intake to provide a barrier to pollen or other irritants.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\n===Living Heat Loss===\nWith the passive and active solar gains, insulation, draft proofed building shell and heat recovery system, eco-houses could be zero heat; that is, in theory, you shouldn't need to keep pumping heat into them from a central heating system. In practice life isn't like that. Kids leave the door open, pets come in and out, people go out all day, cold snaps happen and some people like to sleep with the window open. An eco-house can incorporate design to have heating systems that can react quickly and efficiently to any changes in room temperature as well as providing a heat boost to the water temperature down-stream of the solar panels.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\n===Sustainable Materials===\nOne of the wider issues of energy efficiency is the [[embodied energy]] within the construction materials. (Embodied energy is the energy taken up with producing and transporting the materials used).<ref name=\"Living Village\" />\n\n====Timber====\nWood is a primary building material for eco-housing. This is because trees grow using energy from the Sun, they don't pollute, they produce oxygen, absorb CO2, they provide a wild life habitat, they can be replanted, they can be sourced locally, the timber can easily be put to some other use after a building is demolished.<ref name=\"Living Village\" />\n[[File:Furillen lime stone pile.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Lime is a Sustainable Material for Energy Efficiency]]\n\n====Lime====\nCement is a very useful building material and there are places where we have to be practical and use it. However, one alternative to cement is lime. Lime has been used as a building material for thousands of years and although energy and CO2 are used in its production it gently returns to limestone in time, taking in CO2 in the process.<ref name=\"Living Village\" />\n\n====Reclaimed materials====\nThere is also the use reclaimed materials, particularly bricks, slates and roof tiles, to make use of the embodied energy within these materials. This can also help new buildings to blend in with their surroundings.<ref name=\"Living Village\" />\n\n=== Health ===\nOther benefits of an eco-house, aside from the obvious one of having minimal heating costs, are a healthy living environment. The heat recovery system can eliminate dampness and the moulds that are so often a health hazard. The air intake filters prevent dust coming in with the incoming fresh air and the internal vacuum cleaner system extracts dust from the house and vents it (via the dust collection bag and filter) to the outside, thus no microscopic particles of dust remain in the house.\n\nLoad bearing internal walls are minimised to allow rearrangements of the interior spaces, and the build technology is such that local trades can carry out alterations and easy maintenance.\n\nFor the health of the householder, and the planet, an eco-house should be built with materials that are free, wherever possible, from toxins or harmful products of the petro-chemical industry.<ref name = \"Living Village\" />\n\nThe better indoor environmental quality of eco-houses has also improved health and satisfaction among occupants by reducing exposure to pollutants, allergens, and other contaminants. According to Dr. Joseph Allen and his research at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, this leads to inhabitants of eco-houses suffering less from sick building syndrome while maintaining positive mental and physical stability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150709093046.htm|title=Why not build houses the environmentally friendly way?

Perceptions of costs are one of the main issues for many builders and owners. This perception is induced by the medias coverage of Eco-houses built according to the standards of above average income homeowners. According to ''SmartMarket Report,'' around two-thirds of Eco-house owners, who built their own homes, had an annual budget of over $50,000. This above average income and the freedom in building their own design, furniture, and materials for their Eco-houses attributes to the addition of more expensive features, but this does not mean there are not affordable Eco-houses on the market. It all depends where you allocate your money. <ref name=\":2\" /> Builders of Eco-houses are also taking initiatives to reduce the costs associated with general homes. The main factors contributing to cost for any house includes land, planning, infrastructure, professional fees, accreditation, compliance fees, labour, materials, market, and occupation. With this being said, initiatives being done to reduce house costs for Eco-houses is directed towards materials and the market. In decreasing material costs, Eco-house builders use reclaimed materials. Eco-house builders can also gain community land trust for ownership of land. For example, in Colorado, USA, Eco-builders where able to eliminate costs by building on cheap land in a absent location while using reclaimed materials. With building in a remote location, the Colorado Eco-builders eliminated land costs.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Pickerill|first=Jenny|date=2017|title=Critically Interrogating Eco-Homes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-2427.12453|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=41|issue=2|pages=353\u2013365|doi=10.1111/1468-2427.12453|issn=1468-2427|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Green building]]\n* [[Energy-plus-house]]\n* [[Low-energy house]]\n* [[Street Farm#The First Ecological House|First EcoHouse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ecofriendlyhouses.net/ Eco Friendly Houses]\n* [http://www.thelivingvillagetrust.com/what-is-an-eco-house/?doing_wp_cron=1487144103.3669888973236083984375 The Living Village Trust - What is an eco-house]\n* [https://www.ecobob.co.nz/info-and-news/building-design-construction-and-renovations/net-zero-energy-homes/ Net Zero Energy Homes]\n\n[[Category:Energy efficiency]]\n[[Category:Housing]]\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{About|a type of house}}\n[[File:Ecohouse near Faaker See, Austria.JPG|thumb|311x311px|Ecohouse near Faaker See, Austria.]]\nAn '''Eco-house''' (or eco-home) is an environmentally low-impact home designed and built using materials and technology that reduces its [[carbon footprint]] and lowers its energy needs.

With building in a remote location, the Colorado Eco-builders eliminated land costs.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Pickerill|first=Jenny|date=2017|title=Critically Interrogating Eco-Homes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-2427.12453|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|language=en|volume=41|issue=2|pages=353\u2013365|doi=10.1111/1468-2427.12453|issn=1468-2427|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Green building]]\n* [[Energy-plus-house]]\n* [[Low-energy house]]\n* [[Street Farm#The First Ecological House|First EcoHouse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ecofriendlyhouses.net/ Eco Friendly Houses]\n* [http://www.thelivingvillagetrust.com/what-is-an-eco-house/?doing_wp_cron=1487144103.3669888973236083984375 The Living Village Trust - What is an eco-house]\n* [https://www.ecobob.co.nz/info-and-news/building-design-construction-and-renovations/net-zero-energy-homes/ Net Zero Energy Homes]\n\n[[Category:Energy efficiency]]\n[[Category:Housing]]\n<references />\n", "name_user": "101Schultzy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up the article and added images.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecohouse"}

The strip made its debut on December 19, 1919, featuring the characters [[Olive Oyl]], [[Castor Oyl]] and Harold Hamgravy, whose name was quickly shortened in the strip to simply \"[[Ham Gravy]]\".

''The Five-Fifteen'' started its run as a Monday-through-Saturday strip. In 1926, the retitled ''Sappo'' was converted into a Sunday-only [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] to the ''Thimble Theatre'' Sunday pages. Initially, this strip revolved about the exploits of suburban couple John and Myrtle Sappo. However, Segar later added the character of inventor Professor O. G. Wotasnozzle to ''Sappo''.

Outcault]], the creator of ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' and ''[[Buster Brown]]''. Outcault encouraged him and introduced him at the ''[[Chicago Herald-Examiner|Chicago Herald]]''. On March 12, 1916, the ''Herald'' published Segar's first comic, ''[[Charlie Chaplin's Comic Capers]]'', which ran for a little over a year. In 1917, ''Barry the Boob'' was created. In 1918, he moved on to [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''Chicago Evening American'', for which he created ''Looping the Loop'' and worked as a second-string drama critic.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoonist Segar, Popeye Creator (Obituary)|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=October 14, 1938|page=23|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/10/14/archives/cartoonist-segar-popeye-creator-artist-succumbs-at-his-home-in.html|via=ProQuest Historical Newspapers|url-access=subscription |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref> Segar married Myrtle Johnson that year; they had two children.

He began by drawing ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' for the ''[[New York Journal]]''. The strip made its debut on December 19, 1919, featuring the characters [[Olive Oyl]], [[Castor Oyl]] and Harold Hamgravy, whose name was quickly shortened in the strip to simply \"[[Ham Gravy]]\". They were the strip's leads for about a decade.\n[[File:1933sappolg.jpg|thumb|500px|E. C. Segar's ''Sappo'' (1933).]]Segar also created ''The Five-Fifteen'' for King Features in 1920; it was retitled ''Sappo'' in 1926. ''The Five-Fifteen'' started its run as a Monday-through-Saturday strip. In 1926, the retitled ''Sappo'' was converted into a Sunday-only [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] to the ''Thimble Theatre'' Sunday pages. Initially, this strip revolved about the exploits of suburban couple John and Myrtle Sappo. However, Segar later added the character of inventor Professor O. G. Wotasnozzle to ''Sappo''. Wotasnozzle's bizarre machines soon became the focus of the narrative.<ref>Donald Phelps,''Reading the Funnies: Essays on Comic Strips''. Seattle, Wash. : Fantagraphics Books, 2001. {{ISBN|9781560973683}} (pp.52-3)</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1929, when Castor Oyl needed a [[sailor|mariner]] to navigate his ship to Dice Island, Castor picked up an old sailor in the docks named Popeye. Popeye's first line in the strip, upon being asked if he was a sailor, was \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\"<ref>[[Coulton Waugh]], ''The Comics''. New York, Luna Press, 1974. {{ISBN|9780914466031}} (p.117)</ref> The character stole the show and became the permanent star. Some of the other notable characters Segar created include [[J.

A revival of interest in Segar's creations began with [[Woody Gelman]]'s Nostalgia Press. [[Robert Altman]]'s live-action film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980) is adapted from E. C. Segar's ''Thimble Theatre'' comic strip. The screenplay by [[Jules Feiffer]] was based directly on Gelman's ''Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye the Sailor'', a hardcover reprint collection of 1936-37 Segar strips published in 1971 by Nostalgia Press.<ref>Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, pp. 125-126, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1939-1}}</ref> In 2006, [[Fantagraphics]] published the first of a six-volume book set reprinting all ''Thimble Theatre'' daily and Sunday strips from 1928\u201338, beginning with the adventure that introduced Popeye.\n\nIn 1971, the [[National Cartoonists Society]] created the Elzie Segar Award in his honor. According to the Society's website, the award was \"presented to a person who has made a unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning.\" The NCS board of directors chose the first winners, while King Features selected recipients in later years. Honorees have included [[Charles Schulz]], [[Bil Keane]], [[Al Capp]], [[Bill Gallo]] and [[Mort Walker]].

Following the murder of [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] after the 1994 World Cup, Colombia's team faded in the latter half of the 1990s. They were the champions of the [[2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], which they hosted and set a new [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] record of conceding no goals and winning each match. Prior to that success, they were runners-up to [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in the [[1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. In total, Colombia has gained a top-four result in seven Copa Am\u00e9ricas.

Colombia was able to obtain the bronze medal, with two wins and three losses. The same year, Colombia played at the [[Football at the 1938 Bolivarian Games|I Bolivarian Games]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]], where they finished fourth with one win and three losses. [[Fernando Paternoster]] was the manager of Colombia, the side's first foreign manager.\n\nColombia did not play again until 1945 when they participated for the first time at the [[1945 South American Championship|South American Championship]], finishing in fifth place.

The team, however, repeated their losing streak since, as in the previous tournament, ended eighth with two draws and five losses, scoring four goals.\n\nAfter withdrawal in [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification|1938]] and getting banned in [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|1954]] (due to the controversial [[El Dorado (football)|El Dorado]] era), Colombia participated for the first time in qualifying for the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in Sweden. Their first match was on 16 June 1957 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Bogot\u00e1, a 1\u20131 draw. Colombia lost their next matches, leaving them at the bottom of the group.\n\n[[File:1447 soccer 30.png|thumb|left|Stamp commemorating the match played against Uruguay in the 1962 World Cup.]]\nColombia qualified for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], its first-ever [[FIFA World Cup]] by eliminating [[Peru national football team|Peru]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. At the 1962 World Cup, Colombia was drawn into a tough group containing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]; both had achieved notable results comparing to Colombia. Colombia lost its first match, 2\u20131 against Uruguay. [[Luis Cubilla]] and Jorge Sas\u00eda scored for Uruguay at the 56th and 75th minute respectively, while [[Francisco Zuluaga]] scored a 19th-minute penalty goal for Colombia to give the Colombians their first-ever World Cup goal and a shock lead. In the second match, they earned a 4\u20134 draw with the USSR, champions of the [[1960 European Nations' Cup]]. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, [[Marcos Coll]] scored the only [[olympic goal]] in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against Yugoslavia, who finished in fourth place in the tournament. After the 1962 World Cup, Colombia didn't qualify for over 28 years before they returned in the 1990 edition.\n\n===1990s: The Golden Era===\n[[File:Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Colombia, Italia 90.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Colombia at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]]]\nAt [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], Colombia was once again drawn with the Yugoslavs, alongside [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] and powerhouse [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. Colombia defeated 2\u20130 to the United Arab Emirates to make its first-ever win in the World Cup, then lost to Yugoslavia 1\u20130, but earned their place in the Round of 16 after a respectable 1\u20131 draw with West Germany, who would later win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Colombia would be eliminated in their next match against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] with a [[Cameroon v Colombia (1990 FIFA World Cup)|2\u20131 defeat in extra time]], marked the rise of the new Colombian generation known as Colombian first Golden Generation.\n\nFor the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], Colombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 5\u20130 win over Argentina in [[Buenos Aires]]. Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favorites to win the tournament. Colombia was assigned to the Group A with the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. During the tournament, [[Colombian conflict|internal conflict within Colombia]] proved to be detrimental and harmful for the Colombian squad as the team was distracted from their main goal. Colombia only earned one win over Switzerland and suffered two losses, which would eliminate them in the first phase. The first match against Romania ended with a 3\u20131 defeat that resulted in cartels' threats to relatives of Colombian players. During the match against the United States, an unwanted incident occurred, when [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] scored an own goal, leading to Colombia's elimination. Escobar was later murdered following the own goal in Colombia. This traumatic incident would lead to the demise of Colombia's first Golden Generation.\n\nColombia ended their qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in third place with 28 points, two points below first-place Argentina with 30 points. Colombia was assigned to the Group G alongside [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], [[England national football team|England]] and once again, Romania. Romania, like the 1994 edition, obtained a 1\u20130 victory in the first match. Colombia's second match was a 1\u20130 win against Tunisia, with a goal from [[Leider Preciado]]. In the last match, however, England won the game 2\u20130, thereby eliminating Colombia from the tournament.\n\n===2001 Copa America===\n[[File:Ivan Cordoba - Inter Mailand (2).jpg|thumb|[[Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba]] captained the Colombian team that won the [[2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in which he scored the sole goal in the final against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].]]\n\nThe [[2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Colombia.

Claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the [[Argentine Football Association]] decided to withdraw from the competition the day before the first game, with [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] (a CONCACAF invitee) hastily invited and flown in by the [[Colombian Air Force]] to participate.<ref name=footballtimes/> There were no terrorist incidents within the competition.

However, because of the lack of interest for football in Venezuela, the rivalry was historically very one-sided for Colombia and thus considered irrelevant. This state of affairs started to change from the 1990s, when football slowly began replacing [[baseball]] as Venezuela's main sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes-2/copa-america-2019/2019/06/28/edgardo-broner-en-venezuela-hoy-la-vinotinto-es-mas-que-el-beisbol/|title=Edgardo Broner: \"En Venezuela, hoy la Vinotinto es m\u00e1s que el b\u00e9isbol\"|publisher=Infobae |date= |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Coach Luis Garcia was sacked for only managing a draw on an away game in [[San Cristobal]] which ended 2-2 and a victory was taken for granted. This was just a sign of things to come. Four years later for the qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Venezuela stunned the continent by defeating Colombia in Barranquilla 0\u20131. The game showed the new direction of the rivalry: While Colombia remains ahead on all rankings and competitions, Venezuela always outperform themselves when meeting each other. Former skipper Valderrama started calling the games a ''\u201cclassic\u201d'' and stated ''\u201cVenezuela kill themselves ''[do their best]'' playing against us.\u201d'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/2013/03/26/futbol/futbol_internacional/colombia/1364253932.html|title=Valderrama: \"Venezuela se mata jugando contra nosotros\"\"|publisher=Marca |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2020, Colombia has not been able to win in Venezuelan soil since 1996. During Jose Pekerman's coaching for the [[2014 World Cup qualification]], considered the rebirth of Colombian football, Venezuela still managed to win their game at home, which was one of only three defeats the Argentinean suffered. Venezuela also won the group stage game against Colombia in the [[2015 Copa America]] which were their only 3 points, Colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while Venezuela ended last. However, the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against Argentina.\n\nThe historical Colombian 5\u20130 victory in 1993, beating host Argentina in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] qualifiers, was the very first time Argentina lost in its home stadium [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] during a qualifying match for a World Cup. Argentina comes as a previous twice World Cup champion. It caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry. Unlike other rivalries full of hostility, the Colombian\u2013Argentine rivalry is more based on \"respect\" than a \"hated\" relationship always attracting great interest between both nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deportes.terra.com/futbol/futbol-colombiano/colombia-argentina-rivalidad-llena-de-historia-y-anecdotas,040ba079b8c42310VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Colombia-Argentina: rivalidad llena de Historia y an\u00e9cdotas \u2013 Terra USA |publisher=Deportes.terra.com |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> After the wane of the Valderrama's generation, the rivalry became one-sided again and since then only Colombians kept considering a classic while Argentineans consider it many steps below their historic rivalries against Brazil, England and Uruguay.\n\nColombia also has another small rivalry against Peru, which both fought in the [[Leticia Incident|Leticia War]] to control the Amazon region. Peru is often seen as the buildup of Colombia's football successes, as Colombia had eliminated Peru at the 1962 World Cup qualification to secure its maiden appearance. Matches between two teams also draw a great level of intensity, though not as hostile as with Colombia's rivalry to Brazil.\n\nColombia has a more hostile rivalry against Brazil due to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] encounter, where Brazil defeated Colombia 2\u20131 overshadowed by [[Neymar]]'s injury and referee's favoritism towards Brazil against Colombia.;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2014/07/06/neymars-injury-and-brazils-brutality-against-colombia-at-world-cup-an-alternate-view/|title=Neymar's Injury And Brazil's Brutality Against Colombia At World Cup - An Alternate View|first=Bobby|last=McMahon|website=Forbes}}</ref> This would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense, aggressive and to a certain extent, played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents, especially during the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/17/copa-america-2015-brazil-v-colombia-live|title=Copa Am\u00e9rica 2015: Brazil 0-1 Colombia \u2013 as it happened|first=Bryan Armen|last=Graham|date=18 June 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> The rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the [[2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals]] after [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] asked to award the trophy for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol]].;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/29/atletico-nacional-asks-chapecoense-awarded-copa-sudamericana/|title=Atletico Nacional ask for Chapecoense to be declared Copa Sudamericana champions after plane crash|first=Callum|last=Davis|date=30 November 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Nonetheless, it remains a competitive rivalry between the two.\n\n==Team image==\n{{see also|History of the Colombia national football team#Kits|label 1=Colombia national football team kit history}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"with:100%; text-align:center;\"| Colombia current kit <small>(2017\u20132019)</small>\n|-\n!

At the 1962 World Cup, Colombia was drawn into a tough group containing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]; both had achieved notable results comparing to Colombia. Colombia lost its first match, 2\u20131 against Uruguay. [[Luis Cubilla]] and Jorge Sas\u00eda scored for Uruguay at the 56th and 75th minute respectively, while [[Francisco Zuluaga]] scored a 19th-minute penalty goal for Colombia to give the Colombians their first-ever World Cup goal and a shock lead. In the second match, they earned a 4\u20134 draw with the USSR, champions of the [[1960 European Nations' Cup]]. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper [[Lev Yashin]], widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, [[Marcos Coll]] scored the only [[olympic goal]] in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5\u20130 defeat against Yugoslavia, who finished in fourth place in the tournament. After the 1962 World Cup, Colombia didn't qualify for over 28 years before they returned in the 1990 edition.\n\n===1990s: The Golden Era===\n[[File:Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Colombia, Italia 90.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Colombia at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]]]\nAt [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], Colombia was once again drawn with the Yugoslavs, alongside [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] and powerhouse [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].

Colombia was assigned to the Group A with the hosts [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. During the tournament, [[Colombian conflict|internal conflict within Colombia]] proved to be detrimental and harmful for the Colombian squad as the team was distracted from their main goal. Colombia only earned one win over Switzerland and suffered two losses, which would eliminate them in the first phase. The first match against Romania ended with a 3\u20131 defeat that resulted in cartels' threats to relatives of Colombian players. During the match against the United States, an unwanted incident occurred, when [[Andr\u00e9s Escobar]] scored an own goal, leading to Colombia's elimination. Escobar was later murdered following the own goal in Colombia. This traumatic incident would lead to the demise of Colombia's first Golden Generation.\n\nColombia ended their qualification for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in third place with 28 points, two points below first-place Argentina with 30 points. Colombia was assigned to the Group G alongside [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], [[England national football team|England]] and once again, Romania. Romania, like the 1994 edition, obtained a 1\u20130 victory in the first match. Colombia's second match was a 1\u20130 win against Tunisia, with a goal from [[Leider Preciado]].

Colombia then fell to hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20131 in the quarter-final round in controversy, where media and figures such as [[Diego Maradona]] criticized FIFA and [[Carlos Velasco Carballo]] for \"favoring\" Brazil and being biased in disallowing a goal from [[Mario Yepes]] and allowing too many fouls by the Brazilians to occur without any yellow cards being shown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/27463709 |title=World Cup 2014: Brazil v Colombia \u2013 BBC Sport |website=Bbc.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2014/07/05/en/football/national_teams/1404560207.html |title=Maradona: \"FIFA and ref gave Brazil licence to kick\" \u2013 MARCA.com (English version) |website=MARCA.com |date= |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/05/brazil-colombia-world-cup-referee |title=Brazil v Colombia referee: I am not allowed to discuss decisions  |publisher=The Guardian |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Rice |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup/neymar-out-revealed--fifa-selected-lenient-referees-for-quarterfinals-9586697.html |title=Neymar out: REVEALED \u2013 Fifa selected lenient referees for quarter-finals |publisher=The Independent |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Burrows |first=Ben |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2014/world-cup-2014-james-rodriguez-3816818 |title=World Cup 2014: James Rodriguez slams referee Carlos Velasco Carballo as Colombia bow out to Brazil |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lopez |first=Amy |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/maradona-angry-at-officials-in-brazil-colombia-game-171038640.html |title=Maradona angry at officials in Brazil-Colombia game |website=Sports.yahoo.com |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the elimination, the national team was greeted by tens of thousands of Colombians in Bogot\u00e1, welcoming them back as heroes and restoring pride to the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=thousands-welcome-home-cafeteros-2400922.html#fblg |title=Thousands welcome home Cafeteros |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007120054/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y%3D2014/m%3D7/news%3Dthousands-welcome-home-cafeteros-2400922.html#fblg |archivedate=7 October 2015  }}</ref> Colombia would then receive the [[FIFA World Cup Fair Play Trophy|FIFA Fair Play Trophy]] and have [[James Rodr\u00edguez]] and [[Juan Cuadrado]] end as the World Cup's leading goal scorer and assist leader, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=messi-heralded-as-brazil-2014-s-best-2404615.html |title=Messi, Neuer heralded as Brazil 2014\u2019s best |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/players/goal-scored.html |title=2018 FIFA World Cup Russia\u2122 |publisher=FIFA |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n====2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica====\nColombia had a disappointing [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], having won only a single game during the group stage match against Brazil, with their only goal of the tournament.

However, because of the lack of interest for football in Venezuela, the rivalry was historically very one-sided for Colombia and thus considered irrelevant. This state of affairs started to change from the 1990s, when football slowly began replacing [[baseball]] as Venezuela\u2019s main sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes-2/copa-america-2019/2019/06/28/edgardo-broner-en-venezuela-hoy-la-vinotinto-es-mas-que-el-beisbol/|title=Edgardo Broner: \"En Venezuela, hoy la Vinotinto es m\u00e1s que el b\u00e9isbol\"|publisher=Infobae |date= |accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Coach Luis Garcia was sacked for only managing a draw on an away game in [[San Cristobal]] which ended 2-2 and a victory was taken for granted. This was just a sign of things to come. Four years later for the qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Venezuela stunned the continent by defeating Colombia in Barranquilla 0-1. The game showed the new direction of the rivalry: While Colombia remains ahead on all rankings and competitions, Venezuela always outperform themselves when meeting each other. Former skipper Valderrama started calling the games a ''\u201cclassic\u201d'' and stated ''\u201cVenezuela kill themselves ''[do their best]'' playing against us.\u201d'' <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/2013/03/26/futbol/futbol_internacional/colombia/1364253932.html|title=Valderrama: \"Venezuela se mata jugando contra nosotros\"\"|publisher=Marca |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2020, Colombia has not been able to win in Venezuelan soil since 1996. During Jose Pekerman\u2019s coaching for the [[2014 World Cup qualification]], considered the rebirth of Colombian football, Venezuela still managed to win their game at home, which was one of only three defeats the Argentinean suffered. Venezuela also won the group stage game against Colombia in the [[2015 Copa America]] which were their only 3 points, Colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while Venezuela ended last. However, the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against Argentina.\n\nThe historical Colombian 5\u20130 victory in 1993, beating host Argentina in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] qualifiers, was the very first time Argentina lost in its home stadium [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] during a qualifying match for a World Cup. Argentina comes as a previous twice World Cup champion. It caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry. Unlike other rivalries full of hostility, the Colombian\u2013Argentine rivalry is more based on \"respect\" than a \"hated\" relationship always attracting great interest between both nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deportes.terra.com/futbol/futbol-colombiano/colombia-argentina-rivalidad-llena-de-historia-y-anecdotas,040ba079b8c42310VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Colombia-Argentina: rivalidad llena de Historia y an\u00e9cdotas \u2013 Terra USA |publisher=Deportes.terra.com |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> After the wane of the Valderrama\u2019s generation, the rivalry became one-sided again and since then only Colombians kept considering a classic while Argentineans consider it many steps below their historic rivalries against Brazil, England and Uruguay.\n\nColombia also has another small rivalry against Peru, which both fought in the [[Leticia Incident|Leticia War]] to control the Amazon region. Peru is often seen as the buildup of Colombia's football successes, as Colombia had eliminated Peru at the 1962 World Cup qualification to secure its maiden appearance. Matches between two teams also draw a great level of intensity, though not as hostile as with Colombia's rivalry to Brazil.\n\nColombia has a more hostile rivalry against Brazil due to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] encounter, where Brazil defeated Colombia 2\u20131 overshadowed by [[Neymar]]'s injury and referee's favoritism towards Brazil against Colombia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2014/07/06/neymars-injury-and-brazils-brutality-against-colombia-at-world-cup-an-alternate-view/|title=Neymar's Injury And Brazil's Brutality Against Colombia At World Cup - An Alternate View|first=Bobby|last=McMahon|website=Forbes}}</ref>; This would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense, aggressive and to a certain extent, played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents, especially during the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/jun/17/copa-america-2015-brazil-v-colombia-live|title=Copa Am\u00e9rica 2015: Brazil 0-1 Colombia \u2013 as it happened|first=Bryan Armen|last=Graham|date=18 June 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>; The rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the [[2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals]] after [[Atl\u00e9tico Nacional]] asked to award the trophy for [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/11/29/atletico-nacional-asks-chapecoense-awarded-copa-sudamericana/|title=Atletico Nacional ask for Chapecoense to be declared Copa Sudamericana champions after plane crash|first=Callum|last=Davis|date=30 November 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>; Nonetheless, it remains a competitive rivalry between the two.\n\n==Team image==\n{{see also|History of the Colombia national football team#Kits|label 1=Colombia national football team kit history}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"with:100%; text-align:center;\"| Colombia current kit <small>(2017\u20132019)</small>\n|-\n!

The cabinet would resign to allow the prime minister a free rein to make new appointments and form a cabinet with majority political support. Nadjamoeddin Daeng Malewa held a series of meetings with political supporters and opponents in late May 1947 to decide on the composition of his revised cabinet.{{sfn|Anak Agung|1995|pp=242-245}}\n\n==Second Nadjamoedin Daeng Malewa cabinet==\nThe second Nadjamoedin Daeng Malewa cabinet was announced on 31 May 1947. its composition was{{sfn|Anak Agung|1995|pp=245-248}}\n\n*Prime Minister/Minister of the Economy: Nadjamoeddin Daeng Malewa\n*Secretary of the Interior/Deputy Prime Minister: [[Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung]]\n*Minister of Justice: [[Chris Soumokil|C.R.S.

However, an earlier disease in [[Colombia]]  may have also been caused by ''M. roreri''.

External symptoms like dark spots on the surface of pods can be seen only after 40 to 80 days post infection; thus infected pods during the early stages appear asymptomatic, which is one factor that has led to the unwitting movement of infected pods by humans. One week after the appearance of dark lesions, the characteristic white powder of the disease appears on the surface of infected pods. The powdery appearance is due to the presence of millions of conidia that can reach up to 44 million per square centimeter with a mature infected pod capable of producing more than seven billion spores.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campuzano|first=H|title=Proceedings of the Eighth International Cocoa Research Conference, 1981, Cartagena, Colombia|year=1971|publisher=Cocoa Producer\u2019s Alliance|location=Cartagena, Colombia|pages=425\u2013428}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual reproduction===\nFrosty pod rot is an interesting disease because its causal agent, ''M. roreri'', belongs to a mushroom-forming family, but it has never been observed to produce a mushroom or other type of sexual fruiting structure. Therefore, no evidence of a sexual stage has been found in this fungus thus far.\n\n==History of the disease==\n\n===First report===\nThe first verified report of frosty pod rot is from [[Ecuador]] in 1895; some years later in the region of [[Quevedo, Ecuador]] in 1918, the most famous outbreak in the history of the disease was reported, causing abandonment of most of the cacao plantations over a period of three years. However, an earlier disease in [[Colombia]]  may have also been caused by ''M. roreri''. In 1817 in the region of [[Santander, Colombia]], a disease with symptomology that matches that of frosty pod rot was reported; therefore, many researchers believe the first known report of frosty pod rot of cacao was in Colombia around one century before the famous outbreak in Ecuador.<ref name=\"Phillips-Mora 2003\">{{cite book|last=Phillips-Mora|first=Wilbert|title=Origin, Biogeography, Genetic Diversity and Taxonomic Affinities of the Cacao Fungus Moniliophthora roreri as determined using Molecular, Phytopathological and Morpho-Physiological Evidence|year=2003|publisher=The University of Reading|location=Reading, UK}}</ref>\n\n===Spread===\nBefore the 1950s, ''M. roreri'' was confined to Ecuador, Colombia, and western [[Venezuela]]. However, during the last 50 years, the disease has spread southward into [[Peru]] (in 1988), and northward into all cacao-growing areas of Central America ([[Costa Rica]], 1978; [[Nicaragua]], 1979; [[Honduras]], 1997; [[Guatemala]], 2002; [[Belize]], 2004 and [[Mexico]], 2005),<ref name=\"Phillips-Mora 2003\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips-Mora|first=Wilbert|author2=Aime, M.
