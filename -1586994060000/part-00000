They used a fluorocarbon polymeric barrier to separate the two isotopes via diffusion.<ref name=\":6\" /> The lab also sought to synthesize the corrosive [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas. However, this gas corroded through the material used to make it, so a researcher in Emmett's lab came up with a material that served as the predecessor to [[Teflon]]. Later in life, Emmett expressed great pride in his work on the Manhattan project.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Petroleum research ===\nDuring his 11 years at the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]], much of Emmett's work was funded by [[Gulf Oil]]. Emmett improved on the [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch process]], a key process used to synthesize petroleum hydrocarbon substitutes. He used [[radioisotopes]] like [[Carbon-14]] to study the mechanism of catalytic reactions. In the 1950's, Emmett's research transitioned toward the field of [[Fluid catalytic cracking|catalytic cracking]] in response to a concern in oil supply.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n\n* 1939 - Honorary doctorate from [[Oregon State University|Oregon State College]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1953 - Pittsburgh Award from Pittsburgh, PA; awarded by the [[American Chemical Society]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1955 - Elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] <ref name=\":1\" />\n*1958 - Kendall Award from the [[American Chemical Society]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1964 - Honorary doctorate from [[University of Lyon]] <ref name=\":2\" />\n*1969 - Honorary doctorate from [[Clarkson College]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1970 - Catalyst Club of Philadelphia Award <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1970 - Maryland Section Award from the American Chemical Society <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1972 - Catalysis Society of North America establishes the Paul Emmett Award in his honor <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1974 - Honorary doctorate from [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee|University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1974 - Distinguished Service Award from [[Oregon State University]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1976 - Honorary doctorate of law from [[Hokkaido University]] in Sapporo, Japan<ref name=\":0\" />\n*1977 - Distinguished Alumni Award from the [[California Institute of Technology]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n*1980 - Howard Vollum Award for Science and Technology from [[Reed College]] <ref name=\":0\" />\n* 1980 - [[Chemical Pioneer Award]] from the [[American Institute of Chemists]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaic.org/award_winners/chem_pioneer.html#cpa60s|title=Chemical Pioneer Award|publisher=American Institute of Chemists|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Notable publications ==\n\n* ''Catalysis'' vol 1-5 (1954 - 1957)\n*''Absorption of Gases in Multimolecular Layers'' (1938)\n*''Calculation of Thermodynamic Functions of Adsorbed Molecules from Adsorption Isotherm Measurements: Nitrogen on Graphon'' (1951)\n*''The Catalytic Synthesis of Water Vapor in Contact with Metallic Nickel'' (1925) \n*''The Reduction of Nickelous and Ferric Oxides by Hydrogen'' (1925) \n*''The Crystal Structure of Barite'' (1925)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051230214026/http://osulibrary.orst.edu/specialcollections/coll/emmett/index.html Paul Emmett Papers at Oregon State University (including photos)]\n* [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/emmett-paul.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emmett, Paul H.}}\n[[Category:American chemical engineers]]\n[[Category:Manhattan Project people]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Oregon State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty]]\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:California Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Portland State University faculty]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:20th-century American engineers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox scientist\n| name              = Paul Hugh Emmett\n| image             = Paul Hugh Emmett.jpg\n| image_size        = \n| image_upright     = \n| alt               = \n| caption           = \n| birth_name        = <!-- if different from \"name\" -->\n| birth_date        = {{birth date|1900|9|22}}\n| birth_place       = [[Portland]], Oregon, US\n| death_date        = {{death date and age |1985|4|22 |1900|9|22}}\n| death_place       = [[Portland]], Oregon, US\n| death_cause       = \n| resting_place     = River View Cemetery\n[[Portland]], Oregon, US\n| resting_place_coordinates = <!--{{coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}-->\n| citizenship       = \n| nationality       = [[Americans|American]]\n| workplaces        = \n| alma_mater        = [[California Institute of Technology]]\n[[Oregon State University]]\n| thesis_title      = <!--(or  | thesis1_title =  and  | thesis2_title = )-->\n| thesis_url        = <!--(or  | thesis1_url  =   and  | thesis2_url  =  )-->\n| thesis_year       = <!--(or  | thesis1_year =   and  | thesis2_year =  )-->\n| doctoral_advisor  = Arthur F.

They used a fluorocarbon polymeric barrier to separate the two isotopes via diffusion.<ref name=\":6\" /> The lab also sought to synthesize the corrosive [[uranium hexafluoride]] gas. However, this gas corroded through the material used to make it, so a researcher in Emmett's lab came up with a material that served as the predecessor to [[Teflon]]. Later in life, Emmett expressed great pride in his work on the Manhattan project.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Petroleum research ===\nDuring his 11 years at the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]], much of Emmett's work was funded by [[Gulf Oil]]. Emmett improved on the [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch process]], a key process used to synthesize petroleum hydrocarbon substitutes. He used [[radioisotopes]] like [[Carbon-14]] to study the mechanism of catalytic reactions.

He was a member of the defunct [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and later the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA).\n\nAndriessen applied at the [[Utrecht University]] in June 1947 [[Major (academic)|majoring]] in [[Law]] and obtaining an [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in June 1949 and graduating with an [[Master of Laws]] degree in July 1953. Andriessen worked for a construction institute in [[Utrecht]] from October 1953 until February 1967 as a researcher from October 1953 until July 1961 and as [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) from July 1961 until February 1967.\n\nAndriessen was elected as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] after the [[1967 Dutch general election|election of 1967]], taking office on 23 February 1967 serving as a [[frontbencher]] chairing the [[:nl:Tweede Kamercommissie|special parliamentary committee for Public Housing costs]] and [[spokesperson]] for [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Housing and Spatial Planning]] and deputy spokesperson for [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Local Government Affairs]]. On 16 August 1971 the [[Catholic People's Party#Leaders|Leader of the Catholic People's Party]] and [[Parliamentary leader]] of the Catholic People's Party in the House of Representatives [[Gerard Veringa]] took a leave of absence for health reasons the [[Catholic People's Party#Leaders|Catholic People's Party leadership]] approached Andriessen as interim Parliamentary leader, taking office on 16 August 1971. On 28 September 1971 [[Gerard Veringa|Veringa]] unexpectedly announced that he was stepping down as Leader permanently and the Catholic People's Party leadership approached Andriessen as his successor, Andriessen accepted and became the Leader of the Catholic People's Party, taking office on 1 October 1971. For the [[1972 Dutch general election|election of 1972]] Andriessen served as ''[[Lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate). The Catholic People's Party suffered a loss, losing 8 seats but retained its place as the second largest party and now had 27 seats in the House of Representatives. The following [[Dutch cabinet formation|second cabinet formation of 1972]] resulted in a coalition agreement between the Catholic People's Party, the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP), the [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR) and the [[Democrats 66]] (D'66) which formed the [[Den Uyl cabinet|Cabinet Den Uyl]] with Andriessen opting to remain in the House of Representatives instead of accepting a cabinet post in the new [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]] and he continued to serve in the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader. On 10 December 1976 the Catholic People's Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) choose to merge in a [[political alliance]] to form the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). Incumbent [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Dries van Agt]] of the Catholic People's Party was choose as the first [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] and became the ''Lijsttrekker'' for the [[1977 Dutch general election|election of 1977]]. The following [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation of 1977]] resulted in a coalition agreement between the Christian Democratic Appeal and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) which formed the [[First Van Agt cabinet|Cabinet Van Agt-Wiegel]] with Andriessen appointed as [[List of Ministers of Finance of the Netherlands|Minister of Finance]], taking office on 19 December 1977. On 22 February 1980 Andriessen and [[List of Ministers of Finance of the Netherlands#List of State Secretaries for Finance|State Secretary for Finance]] [[:nl:Adriaan Nooteboom|Ad Nooteboom]] resigned after he disagreed with the cabinets decision to not implement a stronger austerity policy to revitalize the [[Economy of the Netherlands|Economy]] following the [[Early 1980s recession|recession in the 1980s]]. Andriessen remained in active in national politics, he was elected as a [[Senate (Netherlands)|Member of the Senate]] after the [[Historic composition of the Senate of the Netherlands|Senate election of 1980]], taking office on 16 September 1980 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Finances]].\n\nIn November 1980 Andriessen was nominated as the next [[List of European Commissioners by nationality#Netherlands|European Commissioner from the Netherlands]]. Andriessen was giving the heavy portfolios of [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] [[List of European Commission portfolios|and Parliamentary Relations]] in the [[Thorn Commission]], he resigned as a Member of the Senate the same day he was installed as European Commissioner, taking office on 6 January 1981. In December 1984 Andriessen was re-nominated as European Commissioner. He was given the portfolios of [[European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development|Agriculture]] [[European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries|and Fisheries]] and was also appointed as the [[Vice-President of the European Commission|First Vice-President of the European Commission]] in the [[Delors Commission#First college|First Delors Commission]], taking office on 6 January 1985. In November 1988 Andriessen was again re-nominated as European Commissioner.

Andriessen retired after spending 25 years in national politics and became active in the [[private sector]] and [[public sector]] and became active in the [[private sector]] and [[public sector]] and occupied numerous seats as a corporate director and nonprofit director on several boards of directors and supervisory boards ([[Douwe Egberts]], [[Robeco]], [[Royal HaskoningDHV]], [[:nl:DELA|DELA]] and the [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael|Institute of International Relations Clingendael]]) and as an advocate and lobbyist for [[Human rights]], [[Humanitarianism]], [[Democracy]] and for [[European integration]]. Andriessen also served as a distinguished professor of European integration at the Utrecht University from 1 March 1990 until 1 September 2009. Andriessen was known for his abilities as a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus builder]] and [[Negotiation|negotiator]]. Andriessen continued to comment on political affairs as an statesman until his is death at the age of 89 and holds the distinction as the second longest-serving European Commissioner from the Netherlands with {{Age in years and days|1981|01|06|1993|01|06}}.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Opening Staten Generaal , Prinsjesdag 78 minister Andriessen en miljardenkoffer, Bestanddeelnr 929-9090.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Minister of Finance Frans Andriessen with the [[Budget Memorandum (Netherlands)|Budget Memorandum]] during [[Prinsjesdag]] at the [[Binnenhof]] on 19 September 1978.]]\n[[File:Minister Frans Andriessen naast van Agt 23-5-1979 - SFA001014609.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Prime Minister [[Dries van Agt]] and Minister of Finance Frans Andriessen during a financial debate in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] on 23 May 1979.]]\n\nFrom 1958 to 1967 he sat in the provincial assembly, then was elected to the States-General (Parliament).

With Gaston Thorn stepping down at the end of 1984 Andriessen was canvassed as a potential president of the Commission, but Jacques Delors had the big battalions behind him. Andriessen\u2019s consolation was the vice-presidency and the agriculture portfolio, Brussels' toughest. Within weeks he foiled a French attempt to build an EC \"lamb mountain\".\n\nNegotiating his first farm budget, the stumbling block was German insistence on higher payments to grow cereals; Andriessen complained that the Germans sided with the British on budgetary discipline, yet wanted him to spend more. Germany vetoed the budget after six attempts to agree it. Autumn 1985 brought the first of several \"mutton wars\" between Britain and France. Andriessen blamed Britain, accusing Michael Jopling, Minister of Agriculture, of disobeying an \"order\" to change export arrangements for sheep meat. When French farmers hijacked British lamb consignments, Andriessen suggested an export tax to offset the benefits to British exporters of a weak pound; the Commission overruled him. At the start of 1986 Andriessen recommended a general price freeze for the year. He got his way after a 21-hour negotiating session, and later persuaded member states to accept drastic cuts in milk production. His next target was grain surpluses, outlining a plan to cut production which introduced the concept of \"set-aside\". This was adopted, but only after he blocked ministers' efforts to sneak grain subsidies into other parts of the budget.\n\nAt the start of 1989, Andriessen took the external relations portfolio. The Uruguay Round of GATT talks was at the top of his agenda; as a free-trader he saw a faint hope of breaking the deadlock with America. He began by warning Japan that unless it opened its markets, the EC might refuse it licences for banking in Europe. He also told Britain that if it did not want to engage fully with Europe it could go back to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall that autumn gave Andriessen new priorities. He proposed a \"European Economic Space\", enabling EFTA countries to participate in the single market, while opening the door to countries to the East. Within months, he was suggesting affiliate membership of the EC for former Communist satellites. France distrusted this, but the strategy was carried through, after a scare over whether Romania\u2019s post-Ceaucescu government would allow fair elections.\n\nAndriessen\u2019s final two years in Brussels were dominated by the GATT talks. By 1992 he was claiming that the dispute now hinged on \"a couple of million tons of European grain\". But that summer he accused America of \"harassing\" European steel producers for alleged dumping; then France demanded fresh concessions for its farmers. EC-US talks, with Andriessen and Leon Brittan leading for Europe, made no headway. Then farm subsidy negotiations collapsed, with the outgoing Bush administration blaming Europe; Andriessen promised \"countermeasures\". Ireland\u2019s Agriculture Commissioner Ray McSharry resigned, accusing Delors of going behind his back to sabotage an agreement. Delors faced mutiny from commissioners led by Andriessen and Brittan, who resolved to outvote him on GATT, if necessary forcing his resignation. He backed off, and McSharry returned.\n\nOn 20 November 1992, Andriessen and his fellow negotiators finally concluded the GATT agreement on agriculture; the Commission ratified it despite French resistance. Andriessen left Brussels at the turn of the year confident that a full agreement ranging from textiles to intellectual property could be achieved \u2013 as it was, enabling the WTO to come into being.\n\nOut of office, he was in demand as one of Europe\u2019s \"great and good\". This could bring him into trying company: at a symposium in Copenhagen in 1993 he was incandescent when Sir Alan Walters, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former economic adviser, suggested the Germans could put a portrait of Hitler on a single European currency.\n\nAndriessen was Professor of European Integration at the Rijksuniversiteit, Utrecht, from 1989. He was a Knight of the Order of the Dutch Lion, and held the Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married Catherine Ten Holter in 1955 ; she survives him with their four children.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Honours'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

He was a member of the defunct [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and later the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA).\n\nAndriessen applied at the [[Utrecht University]] in June 1947 [[Major (academic)|majoring]] in [[Law]] and obtaining an [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in June 1949 and graduating with an [[Master of Laws]] degree in July 1953. Andriessen worked for a construction institute in [[Utrecht]] from October 1953 until February 1967 as a researcher from October 1953 until July 1961 and as [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) from July 1961 until February 1967.\n\nAndriessen was elected as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] after the [[1967 Dutch general election|election of 1967]], taking office on 23 February 1967 serving as a [[frontbencher]] chairing the [[:nl:Tweede Kamercommissie|special parliamentary committee for Public Housing costs]] and [[spokesperson]] for [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Housing and Spatial Planning]] and deputy spokesperson for [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Local Government Affairs]].

On 28 September 1971 [[Gerard Veringa|Veringa]] unexpectedly announced that he was stepping down as Leader permanently and the Catholic People's Party leadership approached Andriessen as his successor, Andriessen accepted and became the Leader of the Catholic People's Party, taking office on 1 October 1971. For the [[1972 Dutch general election|election of 1972]] Andriessen served as ''[[Lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate). The Catholic People's Party suffered a loss, losing 8 seats but retained its place as the second largest party and now had 27 seats in the House of Representatives. The following [[Dutch cabinet formation|second cabinet formation of 1972]] resulted in a coalition agreement between the Catholic People's Party, the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP), the [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR) and the [[Democrats 66]] (D'66) which formed the [[Den Uyl cabinet|Cabinet Den Uyl]] with Andriessen opting to remain in the House of Representatives instead of accepting a cabinet post in the new [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]] and he continued to serve in the House of Representatives as Parliamentary leader. On 10 December 1976 the Catholic People's Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) choose to merge in a [[political alliance]] to form the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA).

But he came under fire from Socialist MEPs for blocking legislation on worker participation after objections from Shell and Unilever, and from British members for suggesting that Ravenscraig steelworks should be closed. With Gaston Thorn stepping down at the end of 1984 Andriessen was canvassed as a potential president of the Commission, but Jacques Delors had the big battalions behind him. Andriessen\u2019s consolation was the vice-presidency and the agriculture portfolio, Brussels' toughest. Within weeks he foiled a French attempt to build an EC \"lamb mountain\".\n\nNegotiating his first farm budget, the stumbling block was German insistence on higher payments to grow cereals; Andriessen complained that the Germans sided with the British on budgetary discipline, yet wanted him to spend more. Germany vetoed the budget after six attempts to agree it. Autumn 1985 brought the first of several \"mutton wars\" between Britain and France. Andriessen blamed Britain, accusing Michael Jopling, Minister of Agriculture, of disobeying an \"order\" to change export arrangements for sheep meat. When French farmers hijacked British lamb consignments, Andriessen suggested an export tax to offset the benefits to British exporters of a weak pound; the Commission overruled him. At the start of 1986 Andriessen recommended a general price freeze for the year. He got his way after a 21-hour negotiating session, and later persuaded member states to accept drastic cuts in milk production. His next target was grain surpluses, outlining a plan to cut production which introduced the concept of \"set-aside\". This was adopted, but only after he blocked ministers' efforts to sneak grain subsidies into other parts of the budget.\n\nAt the start of 1989, Andriessen took the external relations portfolio. The Uruguay Round of GATT talks was at the top of his agenda; as a free-trader he saw a faint hope of breaking the deadlock with America. He began by warning Japan that unless it opened its markets, the EC might refuse it licences for banking in Europe. He also told Britain that if it did not want to engage fully with Europe it could go back to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall that autumn gave Andriessen new priorities. He proposed a \"European Economic Space\", enabling EFTA countries to participate in the single market, while opening the door to countries to the East. Within months, he was suggesting affiliate membership of the EC for former Communist satellites. France distrusted this, but the strategy was carried through, after a scare over whether Romania\u2019s post-Ceaucescu government would allow fair elections.\n\nAndriessen\u2019s final two years in Brussels were dominated by the GATT talks. By 1992 he was claiming that the dispute now hinged on \"a couple of million tons of European grain\". But that summer he accused America of \"harassing\" European steel producers for alleged dumping; then France demanded fresh concessions for its farmers. EC-US talks, with Andriessen and Leon Brittan leading for Europe, made no headway. Then farm subsidy negotiations collapsed, with the outgoing Bush administration blaming Europe; Andriessen promised \"countermeasures\". Ireland\u2019s Agriculture Commissioner Ray McSharry resigned, accusing Delors of going behind his back to sabotage an agreement. Delors faced mutiny from commissioners led by Andriessen and Brittan, who resolved to outvote him on GATT, if necessary forcing his resignation. He backed off, and McSharry returned.\n\nOn 20 November 1992, Andriessen and his fellow negotiators finally concluded the GATT agreement on agriculture; the Commission ratified it despite French resistance. Andriessen left Brussels at the turn of the year confident that a full agreement ranging from textiles to intellectual property could be achieved \u2013 as it was, enabling the WTO to come into being.\n\nOut of office, he was in demand as one of Europe\u2019s \"great and good\". This could bring him into trying company: at a symposium in Copenhagen in 1993 he was incandescent when Sir Alan Walters, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former economic adviser, suggested the Germans could put a portrait of Hitler on a single European currency.\n\nAndriessen was Professor of European Integration at the Rijksuniversiteit, Utrecht, from 1989. He was a Knight of the Order of the Dutch Lion, and held the Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married Catherine Ten Holter in 1955 ; she survives him with their four children.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Honours'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

His half-brother [[Ernst Reicher]] was popular as gentleman detective [[Stuart Webbs]] in the early German cinema of the 1910s. Frank Reicher immigrated to the States in 1899 and became a naturalized American citizen some twelve years later.<ref name=\"Passport\"/>\n\n[[File:He-Who-Gets-Slapped-1922-3.jpg|thumb| [[Margalo Gillmore]], Frank Reicher and [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] in the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] production of ''He Who Gets Slapped'' (1922) ]]\n\n==Career==\nReicher made his Broadway debut the year he came to America playing Lord Tarquin in [[Harrison Grey Fiske|Harrison Fiske's]] production of ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'', a comedy by [[Langdon Mitchell]] based on [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s]] ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Famous actresses of the day in America\n By Lewis Clinton Strang 1902, pg. 120</ref> His early career was spent in legitimate theater on and off Broadway. He was head of the Brooklyn Stock Company when [[Jacob P. Adler]] performed ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in [[Yiddish]] while the rest of the cast remained in English. Reicher was for a number of years affiliated with the Little Theatre on West Forty-Fourth Street as an actor and manager and would remain active on Broadway as actor, director or producer well into the 1920s. On stage, Reicher starred in such plays as the first Broadway production of [[Georg Kaiser]]'s ''From Morning to Midnight'' (as the cashier), and  the original production of [[Percy MacKaye]]'s ''[[The Scarecrow (play)|The Scarecrow]]'' (in the title role).<ref name=\"NYT\">The New York Times January 23, 1965</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=15960 IBDb.com Frank Reicher]</ref>\n\nFrank Reicher is probably more familiar to modern audiences as a supporting character actor in films.

In 1973, DeCicco and future [[Lucchese crime family]] underboss [[Anthony Casso]] were robbing diamond dealers and hijacking trucks throughout New York State. DeCicco eventually became a protegee of boss Paul Castellano, also a Bath Beach native.  DeCicco was also close to Gambino capo [[James Failla]], whom he described as his \"[[rabbi]]\". DeCicco's crew was one of the most powerful in the Gambino family. It included associate [[Joe Watts | Joseph Watts]], [[John Gotti]]'s chauffeur and bodyguard, Joseph Paruta, and Vito Rizzuto Sr.\n\nDeCicco became heavily involved in labor [[racketeering]] with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] Union Local 282. Through Castellano, he held a no-show [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] union official position with the Local 282.  The members of Local 282 delivered concrete and building materials to construction sites in New York City and Long Island. Although paid overtime, DeCicco was rarely present at any construction sites. DeCicco installed many Gambino members into the Local and was responsible for delivering payoffs from union bosses to the Gambino administration.  DeCicco often attended meetings at Castellano's [[Todt Hill, Staten Island]] mansion.\n\n==Scibetta and DeMeo murders==\nIn 1978, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino associate [[Nicholas Scibetta]]. A [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] user, Scibetta participated in several public fights and insulted the daughter of [[George DeCicco]]. Since Scibetta was [[Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]]'s brother-in-law, Castellano asked Frank to first notify Gravano of the impending hit. When advised of Scibetta's fate, a furious Gravano said he would kill Castellano first. However, Gravano was eventually calmed by DeCicco and accepted Scibetta's death as the punishment earned by his behavior.<ref name=sci>{{cite web|last=May|first=Allan|title=Living by the Rules|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gravano/rules_7.html|work=Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Castellano ordered DeCicco to arrange the murder of Gambino soldier [[Roy DeMeo]]. DeMeo headed a crew that had committed as many as 200 contract killings. By 1983, DeMeo was under heavy law enforcement investigation. Worried that DeMeo might become a government witness, Castellano ordered his killing. Given DeMeo's fearsome reputation, DeCicco found it difficult to find any family members who would take the job. Finally, DeCicco recruited Gambino associates [[Anthony Senter]] and [[Joseph Testa]], both members of DeMeo's crew, to murder their capo.  The two mobsters murdered DeMeo on January 10, 1983.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Castellano and Bilotti murders==\nIn late 1985, DeCicco and [[John Gotti]]<!-- Sr.--> conspired to murder Castellano and his new underboss, [[Thomas Bilotti]]. Castellano had enraged many traditional family members with his fixation on [[White-collar crime|white collar]] crime and his perceived stinginess. When Castellano appointed his chauffeur Bilotti as underboss to replace the recently deceased {{nowrap|[[Aniello Dellacroce]],<ref name=tplvd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CtxVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5927%2C712063 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title='Top level hoodlum' dies of cancer |date=December 4, 1985 |page=12A}}</ref>}} Gotti decided to move against Castellano. Although DeCicco had enjoyed close ties with Castellano, he joined Gotti, [[Joseph Armone]], Gravano, and [[Frank Locascio]] in the murder conspiracy. DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at Sparks Steak House on December 16. DeCicco and mobster James Failla appealed to Castellano to meet with the son of Dellacroce. Since Castellano had skipped Dellacroce's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], this was a good way to make amends to the family.

DeCicco took control of all of the \"[[White-collar crime|white collar]]\" rackets that once belonged to the Castellano faction. Prior to the two murders, Gravano told DeCicco that he, not Gotti, should become the new boss with Gotti as underboss.  DeCicco replied to Gravano,\n\n<blockquote>John's fucking ego is too big. I could be his underboss, but he couldn't be mine. Look, he's got balls, he's got brains, he's got charisma. If we can control him to stop the gambling and all of his flamboyant bullshit, he could be a good boss. Sammy, I'll tell you what. We'll give him a shot. Let him be the boss.

Frankie was steaming. Louie could have betrayed us if he wasn't in jail. He was playing both sides. As soon as Louie got out of jail, Frankie said he had to be killed. A guy like that was too devious. I argued for Louie's life. I asked Frankie, who was now our underboss, to let Louie come under me (Gravano's supervision). After all, we had spared people before. I would tell Louie what we discovered. I would put him on the shelf. I tried to convince Frankie that we didn't have to kill him. But Frankie was adamant. Louie had to die.\"\n\n==Death==\n\nOn April 13, 1986, DeCicco was killed in [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn]], when his car was [[car bomb|bombed]] following a visit to Castellano loyalist [[James Failla]]. The bombing was carried out by [[Victor Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso]] of the Lucchese family, under orders of [[Vincent Gigante]] and Lucchese boss [[Anthony Corallo]], to avenge Castellano and Bilotti by killing their successors; Gotti also planned to visit Failla that day, but canceled, and the bomb was detonated after a soldier who rode with DeCicco was mistaken for the boss.<ref name=\"raab 473\">Raab, pp. 473\u2013476</ref><ref name=\"last don\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Gambino Crime Family:The Last Don|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/5.html|work=TruTV Crime Library|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1997, author [[Jerry Capeci]] reported that Casso, now a government witness, revealed that the plotters selected Genovese associate Herbert Pate to kill Gotti with an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED).  Casso told investigators that the plotters decided to kill Gotti and DeCicco with a bomb in order to make the Gambinos think that [[Zips]], or Sicilian mafiosi, were involved. Although Sicilian gangsters are notorious for using bombs, they have long been forbidden in the American Mafia since they put innocent people at risk.

DeCicco eventually became a protegee of boss Paul Castellano, also a Bath Beach native.  DeCicco was also close to Gambino capo [[James Failla]], whom he described as his \"[[rabbi]]\". DeCicco's crew was one of the most powerful in the Gambino family. It included associate [[Joe Watts | Joseph Watts]], [[John Gotti]]'s chauffeur and bodyguard, Joseph Paruta, and Vito Rizzuto Sr.\n\nDeCicco became heavily involved in labor [[racketeering]] with the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] Union Local 282. Through Castellano, he held a no-show [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] union official position with the Local 282.  The members of Local 282 delivered concrete and building materials to construction sites in New York City and Long Island. Although paid overtime, DeCicco was rarely present at any construction sites. DeCicco installed many Gambino members into the Local and was responsible for delivering payoffs from union bosses to the Gambino administration.  DeCicco often attended meetings at Castellano's [[Todt Hill, Staten Island]] mansion.\n\n==Scibetta and DeMeo murders==\nIn 1978, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino associate [[Nicholas Scibetta]]. A [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] user, Scibetta participated in several public fights and insulted the daughter of [[George DeCicco]]. Since Scibetta was [[Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]]'s brother-in-law, Castellano asked Frank to first notify Gravano of the impending hit. When advised of Scibetta's fate, a furious Gravano said he would kill Castellano first. However, Gravano was eventually calmed by DeCicco and accepted Scibetta's death as the punishment earned by his behavior.<ref name=sci>{{cite web|last=May|first=Allan|title=Living by the Rules|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gravano/rules_7.html|work=Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Castellano ordered DeCicco to arrange the murder of Gambino soldier [[Roy DeMeo]]. DeMeo headed a crew that had committed as many as 200 contract killings. By 1983, DeMeo was under heavy law enforcement investigation. Worried that DeMeo might become a government witness, Castellano ordered his killing. Given DeMeo's fearsome reputation, DeCicco found it difficult to find any family members who would take the job. Finally, DeCicco recruited Gambino associates [[Anthony Senter]] and [[Joseph Testa]], both members of DeMeo's crew, to murder their capo.  The two mobsters murdered DeMeo on January 10, 1983.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Castellano and Bilotti murders==\nIn late 1985, DeCicco and [[John Gotti]]<!-- Sr.--> conspired to murder Castellano and his new underboss, [[Thomas Bilotti]]. Castellano had enraged many traditional family members with his fixation on [[White-collar crime|white collar]] crime and his perceived stinginess. When Castellano appointed his chauffeur Bilotti as underboss to replace the recently deceased {{nowrap|[[Aniello Dellacroce]],<ref name=tplvd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CtxVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5927%2C712063 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title='Top level hoodlum' dies of cancer |date=December 4, 1985 |page=12A}}</ref>}} Gotti decided to move against Castellano. Although DeCicco had enjoyed close ties with Castellano, he joined Gotti, [[Joseph Armone]], Gravano, and [[Frank Locascio]] in the murder conspiracy. DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at Sparks Steak House on December 16. DeCicco and mobster James Failla appealed to Castellano to meet with the son of Dellacroce. Since Castellano had skipped Dellacroce's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], this was a good way to make amends to the family. The dinner meeting was set for [[Sparks Steak House]] in {{nowrap|[[Midtown Manhattan]].<ref name=\"new godfather\">{{cite news|last=Daly|first=Michael|title=The New Godfather: The Rise of John Gotti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mucCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38|accessdate=7 December 2011|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=June 23, 1986}}</ref>}}\n\nJust before 5:30 p.m. on Monday, December 16, Castellano and Bilotti were [[Paul Castellano#Assassination|shot to death]] while exiting their [[Lincoln Town Car]] outside of {{nowrap|Sparks Steak House.<ref name=ergaprmb>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-ttVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3061%2C4363821 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Reputed Mafia boss murdered |date=December 17, 1985 |page=3A}}</ref><ref name=sraphit>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0klj8wIChNAC&dat=19851217&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=(''New York Daily News'') |title=Crime boss, bodyguard murdered in Manhattan |date=December 17, 1985 |page=A1}}</ref><ref name=upimbbmlbl>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=62APAAAAIBAJ&sjid=soYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6746%2C3158237 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Mob boss murder leads to bulletin for Lincoln car |date=December 17, 1985 |page=D4}}</ref><ref name=\"manhattan brooklyn\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Gambino Crime Family: Manhattan vs. Brooklyn|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/4.html|work=TruTV Crime Library|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon after Castellano's death, Gotti declared himself the new family boss and designated DeCicco as his underboss.  DeCicco took control of all of the \"[[White-collar crime|white collar]]\" rackets that once belonged to the Castellano faction. Prior to the two murders, Gravano told DeCicco that he, not Gotti, should become the new boss with Gotti as underboss.  DeCicco replied to Gravano,\n\n<blockquote>John's fucking ego is too big. I could be his underboss, but he couldn't be mine. Look, he's got balls, he's got brains, he's got charisma. If we can control him to stop the gambling and all of his flamboyant bullshit, he could be a good boss. Sammy, I'll tell you what. We'll give him a shot. Let him be the boss.

Frankie was steaming. Louie could have betrayed us if he wasn't in jail. He was playing both sides. As soon as Louie got out of jail, Frankie said he had to be killed. A guy like that was too devious. I argued for Louie's life. I asked Frankie, who was now our underboss, to let Louie come under me (Gravano's supervision). After all, we had spared people before. I would tell Louie what we discovered. I would put him on the shelf. I tried to convince Frankie that we didn't have to kill him. But Frankie was adamant. Louie had to die.\"\n\n==Death==\n\nOn April 13, 1986, DeCicco was killed in [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn]], when his car was [[car bomb|bombed]] following a visit to Castellano loyalist [[James Failla]]. The bombing was carried out by [[Victor Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso]] of the Lucchese family, under orders of [[Vincent Gigante]] and Lucchese boss [[Anthony Corallo]], to avenge Castellano and Bilotti by killing their successors; Gotti also planned to visit Failla that day, but canceled, and the bomb was detonated after a soldier who rode with DeCicco was mistaken for the boss.<ref name=\"raab 473\">Raab, pp. 473\u2013476</ref><ref name=\"last don\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Gambino Crime Family:The Last Don|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/5.html|work=TruTV Crime Library|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1997, author [[Jerry Capeci]] reported that Casso, now a government witness, revealed that the plotters selected Genovese associate Herbert Pate to kill Gotti with an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED).  Casso told investigators that the plotters decided to kill Gotti and DeCicco with a bomb in order to make the Gambinos think that [[Zips]], or Sicilian mafiosi, were involved. Although Sicilian gangsters are notorious for using bombs, they have long been forbidden in the American Mafia since they put innocent people at risk.

However, the FSI is not intended as a tool to predict when states may experience violence or collapse, as it does not measure direction or pace of change. It is possible for a state sorted into the 'stable' zone to be deteriorating at a faster rate than those in the more fragile 'warning' or 'alert' zones, and could experience violence sooner. Conversely, states in the red zone, though fragile, may exhibit positive signs of recovery or be deteriorating slowly, giving them time to adopt mitigating strategies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = What do the Colors and Categories in the Index and on the Map Signify? {{!}} The Fund for Peace|url = http://fundforpeace.org/fsi/frequently-asked-questions/what-do-the-colors-and-categories-in-the-index-and-on-the-map-signify/|website = fsi.fundforpeace.org|access-date = 2017-09-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180315012135/http://fundforpeace.org/fsi/frequently-asked-questions/what-do-the-colors-and-categories-in-the-index-and-on-the-map-signify/|archive-date = 2018-03-15|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==Indicators==\n{{See also|Risk factors for genocide}}\nTwelve conflict risk indicators are used to measure the condition of a state at any given moment.

However, the FSI is not intended as a tool to predict when states may experience violence or collapse, as it does not measure direction or pace of change. It is possible for a state sorted into the 'stable' zone to be deteriorating at a faster rate than those in the more fragile 'warning' or 'alert' zones, and could experience violence sooner. Conversely, states in the red zone, though fragile, may exhibit positive signs of recovery or be deteriorating slowly, giving them time to adopt mitigating strategies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = What do the Colors and Categories in the Index and on the Map Signify? {{!}} The Fund for Peace|url = http://fundforpeace.org/fsi/frequently-asked-questions/what-do-the-colors-and-categories-in-the-index-and-on-the-map-signify/|website = fsi.fundforpeace.org|access-date = 2017-09-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180315012135/http://fundforpeace.org/fsi/frequently-asked-questions/what-do-the-colors-and-categories-in-the-index-and-on-the-map-signify/|archive-date = 2018-03-15|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==Indicators==\n{{See also|Risk factors for genocide}}\nTwelve conflict risk indicators are used to measure the condition of a state at any given moment.
