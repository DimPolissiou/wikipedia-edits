They were a poor family. In his youth he held many jobs but after two years training for a career at sea in the school ship [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']] he joined the [[merchant navy]] and the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] before the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Second World War==\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Crabb was first an army gunner. Then, in 1941, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The next year he was sent to [[Gibraltar]] where he worked in a mine and bomb disposal unit to remove the Italian [[limpet mine]]s that enemy divers had attached to the hulls of Allied ships. Initially, Crabb's job was to disarm mines that British divers removed, but eventually he decided to learn to dive.\n\nHe was one of a group of underwater clearance divers who checked for limpet mines in Gibraltar harbour during the period of [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks]] by the Decima Flottiglia MAS. They dived with oxygen [[rebreather]]s, [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], which until then had not been used much if at all for swimming down from the surface. At first they swam by [[breaststroke]] without [[swimfin]]s.<ref name=knowles>{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Sydney|title=A diver in the dark : Experiences of a pioneer Royal Navy clearance diver|date=2009|publisher=Woodfield Publishing|location=Bognor Regis|isbn=978-1846830822|pages=21\u201322|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 December 1942, during one such attack, two of the Italian [[frogmen]], Lieutenant [[Licio Visintini|Visintini]] and Petty Officer Magro, died, probably killed by small explosive charges thrown from harbor-defence patrol boats, a tactic said to have been introduced by Crabb. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins and [[Scuba set]]s were taken and from then on used by [[Sydney Knowles]] and Crabb.\n\n==Awards==\nCrabb was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his efforts and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]]. In 1943 he became Principal Diving Officer for [[Northern Italy]], and was assigned to clear mines in the ports of [[Livorno]] and [[Venice]]; he was later created an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for these services. He was also an investigating diver in the [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski's death controversy|suspicious death]] of [[General Sikorski]] of the [[Polish Army]], whose [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft crashed near Gibraltar in 1943.<ref>UKTV History \"Infamous Assassinations\", episode \"General Sikorski\" aired 2 April 2008</ref>\n\nBy this time he had gained the nickname \"Buster\", after the American actor and swimmer [[Buster Crabbe]]. After the war Crabb was stationed in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and led an underwater explosives disposal team that removed mines placed by Jewish divers from the [[Palyam]], the maritime force of the [[Palmach]] elite Jewish fighting force during the years of [[Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eldar|first1=Mike|title=Shayetet 13|date=1993|publisher=Sifriat Ma'ariv|location=Tel Aviv|pages=68, 81\u201383}}</ref> After 1947, he was demobilised from the military.\n\n==Civilian diver==\nCrabb moved to a civilian job and used his diving skills to explore the wreck of a [[Spanish galleon]] from the [[Spanish armada|1588 Armada]], off [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] on the [[Isle of Mull]]. He then located a suitable site for a discharge pipe for the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]]. He later returned to work for the Royal Navy. He twice dived to investigate sunken Royal Navy submarines \u2014 {{HMS|Truculent|P315|6}} in January 1950 and {{HMS|Affray|P421|6}} in 1951 \u2014 to find out whether there were any survivors. Both efforts proved fruitless. In 1952, Crabb married Margaret Elaine Player, the daughter of Henry Charles Brackenbury Williamson and the former wife of Ernest Albert Player. The couple separated in 1953 and divorced about two years later.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nIn 1955 Crabb took frogman [[Sydney Knowles]] with him to investigate the hull of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''[[Sverdlov-class cruiser]]'' to evaluate its superior manoeuvrability. According to Knowles, they found a circular opening at the ship's bow and inside it a large [[propeller]] that could be directed to give [[Bow thruster|thrust to the bow]]. That same year, March 1955, Crabb was made to retire due to his age, but a year later he was recruited by [[MI6]]. By this point, Crabb's heavy drinking and smoking had taken its toll on his health, and Crabb was not the diver that he had been in World War II.<ref name=\"Hoole\"/>\n\n==Crabb Affair==\n===Disappearance===\n[[File:AleksandrNevskiy1983a.jpg|thumb|240px| ''Ordzhonikidze'' was a [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|''Sverdlov''-class cruiser]] similar to that shown in this photograph (''Alexander Nevsky'').]]\nMI6 recruited Crabb in 1956 to investigate the Soviet cruiser ''[[Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze|Ordzhonikidze]]'' that had taken [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] on a diplomatic mission to Britain.<ref name=\"hastings\">{{cite news|last1=Hastings|first1=Stephen|title=Obituary: Nicholas Elliott|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-nicholas-elliott-1370833.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=[[The Independent]] (newspaper)|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>  According to [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]] in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' (1987), Crabb was sent to investigate ''Ordzhonikidze''{{'}}s propeller, a new design that Naval Intelligence wanted to examine. On 19 April 1956, Crabb dived into [[Portsmouth Harbour]] and his MI6 controller never saw him again. Crabb's companion in the Sally Port Hotel took all his belongings and even the page of the hotel register on which they had written their names. Ten days later British newspapers published stories about Crabb's disappearance in an underwater mission.\n\nMI6 tried to cover up this espionage mission. On 29 April, under instructions from Rear Admiral [[John Gilchrist Inglis|John Inglis]], the [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]],<ref name=\"Hoole\">{{cite web|last=Hoole|first=Rob|title=The Buster Crabb Enigma|url= http://www.mcdoa.org.uk/Buster%20Crabb%20Enigma.htm |publisher=Warship World|accessdate=10 July 2011|date= January 2007}}</ref> the Admiralty announced that Crabb had vanished when he had taken part in trials of secret underwater apparatus in [[Stokes Bay]] on the [[Solent]]. The Soviets answered by releasing a statement stating that the crew of ''Ordzhonikidze'' had seen a frogman near the cruiser on 19 April.\n\nBritish newspapers speculated that the Soviets had captured Crabb and taken him to the Soviet Union. The [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|British Prime Minister]] [[Anthony Eden]] apparently disapproved of the fact that MI6 had operated without his consent in the UK (the preserve of the Security Service, \"MI5\"). It is mistakenly claimed that Eden forced director-general [[John Sinclair (British spy)|John Sinclair]] to resign following the incident. In fact, he had determined to replace Sinclair with MI5 director-general [[Dick White]] before the incident.<ref>Andrew, Christopher. \"Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5.\" p. 326.</ref> Eden told MPs it was not in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which the frogman met his end.<ref name=mirror-20071117>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|title=Cold war spy riddle ends|author=Nick Webster and Claire Donnelly|date=17 November 2007|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=17 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118224401/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|archive-date=18 November 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Rawls, John.

Sydney Knowles was requested to identify the body shortly after its discovery.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}} He described the body as being clad in a faded green rubber frogman suit of a type issued to Royal Navy divers, and the remains of a white sweater.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 140}} The suit had been cut open from the neck to the groin and along both legs, revealing very dark pubic hair.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139}} Knowles examined the body closely, looking for a Y-shaped scar behind the left knee and a prominent scar on the left thigh. He failed to find any scars on the body, and stated that it was not Crabb.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139-140}}\n\nA pathologist, Dr. D. P. King, examined the body and stated in a short report for the inquest that a careful examination of the body failed to reveal any scars or marks of identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}}\n\n===Inquest===\nThe [[inquest]] was opened on 11 June 1957 by Bridgman, who had received the pathologist's report that there was no way of establishing identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}} As neither Knowles nor Crabb's ex-wife nor a Lieutenant McLanachan, a Royal Navy torpedo officer from HMS ''Vernon'', had been able to identify the body, Bridgman adjourned the inquest until 26 June to allow time for a positive identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}}\n\nThe inquest was resumed on 26 June. The pathologist, King, gave evidence that he had returned to the mortuary and re-examined the body on 14 June.

The ship operated in the conflict against the Netherlands over [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], and was later used as a floating detention centre for suspected communists during the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u20131966]]. The cruiser was scrapped in 1971.\n\n==Theories and speculations==\n===Died during Soviet interrogation===\nThe spy [[Harry Houghton]] wrote a book called ''Operation Portland'' after he was released from prison in which he outlined the explanation of Crabb's death which he claimed to have been given by his Russian handler, a man he knew as Roman, in July 1956. Houghton claims that shortly before the Soviet visit he had been meeting Roman in a pub in [[Puncknowle]], Dorset, and happened to see a friend who worked at the Underwater Detection Establishment with her boyfriend who was a diver. The boyfriend was annoyed that he had been training for something special, which had just been called off. Shortly after hearing this, Roman had cut short the meeting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |page=43 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this account, after guessing that there may be some attempt by divers connected with ''Ordzhonikidze'', the Soviet Navy had arranged for six underwater sentries to watch the bottom of the ship, which had been fitted with wire jackstays on either side to help them hold on to. When Crabb arrived, a struggle ensued in which Crabb's air supply was turned off and he passed out. He was then hauled on board, and taken to the sick bay (having passed out a second time) and given medical treatment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=49\u201350 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\nWhen Crabb had recovered sufficiently, the Soviets began to interrogate him; Crabb was making a confession when he collapsed and this time did not recover. The Soviets, aware that they might be accused of causing his death, decided to fix his body lightly to the bottom of the ship so that it came loose once the ship was under way. In the event, the body entangled in something underwater which meant it did not get discovered for fourteen months. Houghton also puts forward the theory that Crabb's mission was to plant a small [[limpet mine]] on ''Ordzhonikidze'' whose purpose was to detect whether the Soviet Navy was using the latest [[sonar]] technology: if it was, the mine would detonate, and the ship would slow down; if not, the mine would eventually detach and go to the bottom of the sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\n===Killed by the Soviets===\nIn a 1990 interview Joseph Zwerkin, a former member of Soviet Naval intelligence who had moved to [[Israel]] as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]], claimed that the Soviets had noticed Crabb in the water and that a Soviet sniper had shot him.\n\nOn 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on ''Ordzhonikidze''{{'}}s hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

Kerans]] (and later in 1964 [[Marcus Lipton]]) submitted proposals to re-open the case but were rebuffed. Various people speculated that Crabb had been killed by some secret Soviet underwater weapon; that he had been captured and imprisoned in [[Lefortovo prison]] with prison number 147, that he had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] to work for the Soviet Union to train their frogman teams; that he had defected and became a commander in the Soviet Navy;<ref>See ''The Fake Defector'' by Hutton who suggests he used the name \"Lev Lvovich Korablov\"</ref> that he was in the Soviet Special Task Underwater Operational Command in the [[Black Sea]] Fleet; or that MI6 had asked him to defect so he could become a [[double agent]].<ref name=\"Hoole\"/>\n\n===MI5 theory===\nOn 26 March 2006, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' published an article by Tim Binding entitled \"Buster Crabb was murdered \u2013 by MI5\".

This would have been embarrassing for the UK \u2014 Crabb being an acknowledged war hero. Knowles has suggested that MI5 set up the mission to the ''Ordzhonikidze'' specifically to murder Crabb, and supplied Crabb with a new diving partner who was under orders to kill him. Binding stated Knowles alleged that he was ordered by MI5 to identify the body found as Crabb, when he knew it was definitely not Crabb. Knowles went along with the deception. Knowles has also alleged that his life was threatened in [[Torremolinos]] in 1989, at a time when Knowles was in discussions with a [[biographer]]. About the claims that Crabb was planning to defect to the Soviet Union, Reg Vallintine of the Historical Diving Society was quoted as saying:\"Diving historians find it very hard to believe that this man, who prided himself on being a patriot, would have seriously considered defecting. Crabb was very fond of being a hero, and it is hard to imagine him jeopardising that status.\"<ref name=\"MI5 linked to Crabb death\"/> It is not clear just why MI6 would recruit a man who was known to be planning to defect to the Soviet Union to spy against the Soviet Union or why Crabb would agree to such a mission if he really had decided that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union.\n\n===Death by misadventure===\nThe British diving expert Rob Hoole wrote in 2007 that Crabb had probably died of oxygen poisoning or perhaps carbon dioxide poisoning, and that Crabb's age and poor health caused by his heavy drinking and smoking had made him unsuitable for the mission that he had been assigned.<ref name=\"Hoole\"/> In support of the death by misadventure theory, Hoole noted that before disappearing on his second attempt to dive ''Ordzhonikidze'', Crabb had during his first attempt experienced equipment failure, which suggested that Crabb's equipment was not up to standard.<ref name=\"Hoole\"/> Crabb's MI6 officer [[John Nicholas Rede Elliott]] always took the view that Crabb had suffered equipment failure and/or his health had given way, and that his reputation had been unfairly dragged through the mud.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Hastings  | first = Stephen  | authorlink = Stephen Hastings    | title = Obituary: Nicholas Elliott   | newspaper = The Independent  |date= 18 April 1994| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-nicholas-elliott-1370833.html    | accessdate = 2 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Historical media===\nIn a War Documentary Series titled \"Secrets Of War,\" episode titled  \"The Cold War.

They were a poor family. In his youth he held many jobs but after two years training for a career at sea in the school ship [[HMS Conway (school ship)|HMS ''Conway'']] he joined the [[merchant navy]] and the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] before the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Second World War==\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Crabb was first an army gunner. Then, in 1941, he joined the [[Royal Navy]]. The next year he was sent to [[Gibraltar]] where he worked in a mine and bomb disposal unit to remove the Italian [[limpet mine]]s that enemy divers had attached to the hulls of Allied ships. Initially, Crabb's job was to disarm mines that British divers removed, but eventually he decided to learn to dive.\n\nHe was one of a group of underwater clearance divers who checked for limpet mines in Gibraltar harbour during the period of [[Decima Flottiglia MAS#Chronicle of operations|Italian frogman and manned torpedo attacks]] by the Decima Flottiglia MAS. They dived with oxygen [[rebreather]]s, [[Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus]], which until then had not been used much if at all for swimming down from the surface. At first they swam by [[breaststroke]] without [[swimfin]]s.<ref name=knowles>{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Sydney|title=A diver in the dark : Experiences of a pioneer Royal Navy clearance diver|date=2009|publisher=Woodfield Publishing|location=Bognor Regis|isbn=978-1846830822|pages=21\u201322|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 December 1942, during one such attack, two of the Italian [[frogmen]], Lieutenant [[Licio Visintini|Visintini]] and Petty Officer Magro, died, probably killed by small explosive charges thrown from harbor-defence patrol boats, a tactic said to have been introduced by Crabb. Their bodies were recovered, and their swimfins and [[Scuba set]]s were taken and from then on used by [[Sydney Knowles]] and Crabb.\n\n==Awards==\nHe was awarded the [[George Medal]] for his efforts and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]]. In 1943 he became Principal Diving Officer for [[Northern Italy]], was assigned to clear mines in the ports of [[Livorno]] and [[Venice]]; he was later created an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for these services. He was also an investigating diver in the [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski's death controversy|suspicious death]] of [[General Sikorski]] of the [[Polish Army]], whose [[B-24 Liberator]] aircraft crashed near Gibraltar in 1943.<ref>UKTV History \"Infamous Assassinations\", episode \"General Sikorski\" aired 2 April 2008</ref>\n\nBy this time he had gained the nickname \"Buster\", after the American actor and swimmer [[Buster Crabbe]]. After the war Crabb was stationed in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and led an underwater explosives disposal team that removed mines placed by Jewish divers from the [[Palyam]], the maritime force of the [[Palmach]] elite Jewish fighting force during the years of [[Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eldar|first1=Mike|title=Shayetet 13|date=1993|publisher=Sifriat Ma'ariv|location=Tel Aviv|pages=68, 81\u201383}}</ref> After 1947, he was demobilised from the military.\n\n==Civilian diver==\nCrabb moved to a civilian job and used his diving skills to explore the wreck of a [[Spanish galleon]] from the [[Spanish armada|1588 Armada]], off [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] on the [[Isle of Mull]]. He then located a suitable site for a discharge pipe for the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]]. He later returned to work for the Royal Navy. He twice dived to investigate sunken Royal Navy submarines \u2014 {{HMS|Truculent|P315|6}} in January 1950 and {{HMS|Affray|P421|6}} in 1951 \u2014 to find out whether there were any survivors. Both efforts proved fruitless. In 1952, Crabb married Margaret Elaine Player, the daughter of Henry Charles Brackenbury Williamson and the former wife of Ernest Albert Player. The couple separated in 1953 and divorced about two years later.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nIn 1955 Crabb took frogman [[Sydney Knowles]] with him to investigate the hull of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''[[Sverdlov-class cruiser]]'' to evaluate its superior manoeuvrability. According to Knowles, they found a circular opening at the ship's bow and inside it a large [[propeller]] that could be directed to give [[Bow thruster|thrust to the bow]]. That same year, March 1955, Crabb was made to retire due to his age, but a year later he was recruited by [[MI6]].

In fact, he had determined to replace Sinclair with MI5 director-general [[Dick White]] before the incident.<ref>Andrew, Christopher. \"Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5.\" p. 326.</ref> Eden told MPs it was not in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which the frogman met his end.<ref name=mirror-20071117>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|title=Cold war spy riddle ends|author=Nick Webster and Claire Donnelly|date=17 November 2007|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=17 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118224401/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/11/17/cold-war-spy-riddle-ends-89520-20119884/|archive-date=18 November 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Rawls, John.

Sydney Knowles was requested to identify the body shortly after its discovery.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}} He described the body as being clad in a faded green rubber frogman suit of a type issued to Royal Navy divers, and the remains of a white sweater.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 140}} The suit had been cut open from the neck to the groin and along both legs, revealing very dark pubic hair.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139}} Knowles examined the body closely, looking for a Y-shaped scar behind the left knee and a prominent scar on the left thigh. He failed to find any scars on the body, and stated that it was not Crabb.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 139-140}}\n\nA pathologist, Dr. D. P. King, examined the body and stated in a short report for the inquest that a careful examination of the body failed to reveal any scars or marks of identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 138}}\n\n===Inquest===\nThe [[inquest]] was opened on 11 June 1957 by Bridgman, who had received the pathologist's report that there was no way of establishing identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}} As neither Knowles nor Crabb's ex-wife nor a Lieutenant McLanachan, a Royal Navy torpedo officer from HMS ''Vernon'', had been able to identify the body, Bridgman adjourned the inquest until 26 June to allow time for a positive identification.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 142}}\n\nThe inquest was resumed on 26 June. The pathologist, King, gave evidence that he had returned to the mortuary and re-examined the body on 14 June. He reported that he had found a scar in the shape of an inverted Y on the left side of the left knee, and a scar on the left thigh, about the size of a [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpenny coin]]. King stated that the scar had been photographed whilst he was present.{{sfnp|Knowles|2009|p= 144}}\n\n===Fate===\nAs information was declassified under the 50-year rule, new facts on Crabb's disappearance came to light. On 27 October 2006, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|the National Archives]] released papers relating to the fatal ''Ordzhonikidze'' mission.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6089952.stm|title=Details on vanished 'spy' diver|publisher=BBC|date=27 October 2007|accessdate= 10 July 2013}}</ref> Sydney Knowles, a former diving partner of Crabb's, stated in a televised interview on ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out \u2013 South]]'' on 19 January 2007 that Crabb did not dive alone on his fatal last mission: \"He told me they'd given him a buddy diver.\" Furthermore, papers released under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] indicate that there were other divers investigating ''Ordzhonikidze'' while the ship was in Portsmouth Harbour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series11/index_mobile_phones_bugging.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out |publisher=BBC |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2012 }}</ref> On 9 November 2007, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported how the government had covered up the death of 'Buster' Crabb.<ref>{{cite news|last=Verkaik |first=Robert |title=Freedom Of Information: How the Government covered up the death of 'Buster' Crabb |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 November 2007 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article3143239.ece |location=London |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111015318/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article3143239.ece |archivedate=11 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe cruiser ''Ordzhonikidze'' was later transferred by the Soviet government to Indonesia in 1962, where it operated as KRI ''Irian''. The ship operated in the conflict against the Netherlands over [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], and was later used as a floating detention centre for suspected communists during the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u20131966]]. The cruiser was scrapped in 1971.\n\n==Theories and speculations==\n===Died during Soviet interrogation===\nThe spy [[Harry Houghton]] wrote a book called ''Operation Portland'' after he was released from prison in which he outlined the explanation of Crabb's death which he claimed to have been given by his Russian handler, a man he knew as Roman, in July 1956. Houghton claims that shortly before the Soviet visit he had been meeting Roman in a pub in [[Puncknowle]], Dorset, and happened to see a friend who worked at the Underwater Detection Establishment with her boyfriend who was a diver. The boyfriend was annoyed that he had been training for something special, which had just been called off. Shortly after hearing this, Roman had cut short the meeting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |page=43 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this account, after guessing that there may be some attempt by divers connected with ''Ordzhonikidze'', the Soviet Navy had arranged for six underwater sentries to watch the bottom of the ship, which had been fitted with wire jackstays on either side to help them hold on to. When Crabb arrived, a struggle ensued in which Crabb's air supply was turned off and he passed out. He was then hauled on board, and taken to the sick bay (having passed out a second time) and given medical treatment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=49\u201350 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\nWhen Crabb had recovered sufficiently, the Soviets began to interrogate him; Crabb was making a confession when he collapsed and this time did not recover. The Soviets, aware that they might be accused of causing his death, decided to fix his body lightly to the bottom of the ship so that it came loose once the ship was under way. In the event, the body entangled in something underwater which meant it did not get discovered for fourteen months. Houghton also puts forward the theory that Crabb's mission was to plant a small [[limpet mine]] on ''Ordzhonikidze'' whose purpose was to detect whether the Soviet Navy was using the latest [[sonar]] technology: if it was, the mine would detonate, and the ship would slow down; if not, the mine would eventually detach and go to the bottom of the sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houghton |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Houghton |title=Operation Portland |publisher=Hart-Davis |year=1972 |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0246105488}}</ref>\n\n===Killed by the Soviets===\nIn a 1990 interview Joseph Zwerkin, a former member of Soviet Naval intelligence who had moved to [[Israel]] as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]], claimed that the Soviets had noticed Crabb in the water and that a Soviet sniper had shot him.\n\nOn 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on ''Ordzhonikidze''{{'}}s hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

Kerans]] (and later in 1964 [[Marcus Lipton]]) submitted proposals to re-open the case but were rebuffed. Various people speculated that Crabb had been killed by some secret Soviet underwater weapon; that he had been captured and imprisoned in [[Lefortovo prison]] with prison number 147, that he had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] to work for the Soviet Union to train their frogman teams; that he had defected and became a commander in the Soviet Navy;<ref>See ''The Fake Defector'' by Hutton who suggests he used the name \"Lev Lvovich Korablov\"</ref> that he was in the Soviet Special Task Underwater Operational Command in the [[Black Sea]] Fleet; or that MI6 had asked him to defect so he could become a [[double agent]].<ref name=\"Hoole\"/>\n\n===MI5 theory===\nOn 26 March 2006, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' published an article by Tim Binding entitled \"Buster Crabb was murdered \u2013 by MI5\". Binding wrote a fictionalised account of Crabb's life, ''Man Overboard'' which was published by Picador in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|author=DJ Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview14 |title=Review: Man Overboard by Tim Binding|newspaper=The Guardian |date= 11 June 2005|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Binding stated that, following the book's publication, he was contacted by [[Sydney Knowles]].<ref name=\"MI5 linked to Crabb death\">{{cite web|url=http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/latest-news/2514-mi5-linked-to-crabb-death |title=MI5 linked to Crabb death |publisher=Divemagazine.co.uk |date=21 April 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Binding alleged that he then met Knowles in [[Spain]] and was told that Crabb was known by [[MI5]] to have intentions of [[defection|defecting]] to the [[USSR]]. This would have been embarrassing for the UK \u2014 Crabb being an acknowledged war hero. Knowles has suggested that MI5 set up the mission to the ''Ordzhonikidze'' specifically to murder Crabb, and supplied Crabb with a new diving partner who was under orders to kill him. Binding stated Knowles alleged that he was ordered by MI5 to identify the body found as Crabb, when he knew it was definitely not Crabb. Knowles went along with the deception. Knowles has also alleged that his life was threatened in [[Torremolinos]] in 1989, at a time when Knowles was in discussions with a [[biographer]]. About the claims that Crabb was planning to defect to the Soviet Union, Reg Vallintine of the Historical Diving Society was quoted as saying:\"Diving historians find it very hard to believe that this man, who prided himself on being a patriot, would have seriously considered defecting. Crabb was very fond of being a hero, and it is hard to imagine him jeopardising that status.\"<ref name=\"MI5 linked to Crabb death\"/> It is not clear just why MI6 would recruit a man who was known to be planning to defect to the Soviet Union to spy against the Soviet Union or why Crabb would agree to such a mission if he really had decided that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union.\n\n===Death by misadventure===\nThe British diving expert Rob Hoole wrote in 2007 that Crabb had probably died of oxygen poisoning or perhaps carbon dioxide poisoning, and that Crabb's age and poor health caused by his heavy drinking and smoking had made him unsuitable for the mission that he had been assigned.<ref name=\"Hoole\"/> In support of the death by misadventure theory, Hoole noted that before disappearing on his second attempt to dive ''Ordzhonikidze'', Crabb had during his first attempt experienced equipment failure, which suggested that Crabb's equipment was not up to standard.<ref name=\"Hoole\"/> Crabb's MI6 officer [[John Nicholas Rede Elliott]] always took the view that Crabb had suffered equipment failure and/or his health had given way, and that his reputation had been unfairly dragged through the mud.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Hastings  | first = Stephen  | authorlink = Stephen Hastings    | title = Obituary: Nicholas Elliott   | newspaper = The Independent  |date= 18 April 1994| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-nicholas-elliott-1370833.html    | accessdate = 2 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Historical media===\nIn a War Documentary Series titled \"Secrets Of War,\" episode titled  \"The Cold War.
