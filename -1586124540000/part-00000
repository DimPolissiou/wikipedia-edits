The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match.

In Irish, Fahan is named after its [[patron saint]], [[Saint Mura]], first [[abbot]] of Fahan, an early Christian [[monastery]].\n\n==History==\nThe walled graveyard, located west of the [[rectory]], contains the grave of pioneering [[nursing|nurse]] [[Agnes Jones]], the ruins of a 6th-century monastery featuring a 7th-century cross-slab of St. Mura, and the ruins of a 16th-century monastery and 17th-century church together with a number of grave slabs bearing coats of arms. The monastery and village were sacked by [[Vikings]] in the 10th and 13th centuries. Medieval mill wheels are built into both the graveyard wall and the wall on the opposite side of the road.\n\n[[Cecil Frances Alexander]] lived in the old rectory in the late 19th century.

In Irish, Fahan is named after its [[patron saint]], [[Saint Mura]], first [[abbot]] of Fahan, an early Christian [[monastery]].\n\n==History==\nThe walled graveyard, located west of the [[rectory]], contains the grave of pioneering [[nursing|nurse]] [[Agnes Jones]], the ruins of a 6th-century monastery featuring a 7th-century cross-slab of St. Mura, and the ruins of a 16th-century monastery and 17th-century church together with a number of grave slabs bearing coats of arms. The monastery and village were sacked by [[Vikings]] in the 10th and 13th centuries. Medieval mill wheels are built into both the graveyard wall and the wall on the opposite side of the road.\n\n[[Cecil Frances Alexander]] lived in the old rectory in the late 19th century.

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion
