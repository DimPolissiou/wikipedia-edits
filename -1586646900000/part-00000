The characters attend \"Acme Looniversity\", a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons, such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.\n\nLike the [[Looney Tunes]], the series makes use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] (e.g. [[Anvil#Television and film|anvils]] falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and [[slapstick]]. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and [[Hollywood]] culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of [[ecology]], [[self-esteem]], and [[crime]].\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters}}\n[[Image:Promo tiny toon .jpg|left|thumb|210px|Artwork displaying a majority of the [[List of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures|''Tiny Toon'' cast]].]]\n<!--please don't re-add the list to this section; see talk page-->\nThe series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] [[Acme Looniversity|Looniversity]] to be the next generation of ''Looney Tunes'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: [[Buster Bunny]], a blue male rabbit, and [[Babs Bunny]], a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include [[Fifi La Fume]], a purple-and-white female skunk; [[Shirley The Loon]], a white female [[loon]]; [[Dizzy Devil]], a purple tasmanian devil; [[Furrball]], a blue cat; [[Sweetie Pie (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Sweetie Pie]], a pink canary; [[Calamity Coyote]], a bluish-gray coyote; [[Little Beeper]], a red-orange roadrunner; and [[Gogo Dodo]], a zany green dodo. Two human characters, [[Montana Max]] and [[Elmyra Duff]], are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included [[Li'l Sneezer]], a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; [[Concord Condor]], a purple condor; [[Byron Basset]], a usually sleeping basset hound; [[Bookworm (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Bookworm]], a green worm with glasses; [[Arnold the Pit Bull]], a muscular white pit bull; [[Fowlmouth]], a white rooster with horrid language; [[Barky Marky]], a brown dog, and [[Mary Melody]], a young African American human girl.\n\nFeeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig among others. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.\n\n==Production==\n===Writers===\nThe series and the show's characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader [[Jean MacCurdy]], associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer [[Wayne Kaatz]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, and many other artists and directors. The series was actually planned to be a feature film. Once Steven Spielberg was attached, numerous things changed, including the idea of turning the movie into a television series.\n\n\"Buster and Babs Go To Hawaii\" was co-written by three then-teenage girls who were fans of the show.<ref name=writers>{{cite news |last=Berkman |first=Meredith |title=Adventures among the 'Toons' |url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,313220,00.html |accessdate=28 May 2011 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |issue=51 |date=February 1, 1991 |location=[[New York City]] |issn=1049-0434 |oclc=21114137}}</ref>\n\n===Casting info===\nVoice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] auditioned over 1,200 voices for the series and chose more than a dozen main voice actors.<ref name=\"collab\">{{cite web |title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Long-Awaited 'Volume 3' DVD Brings Toons from 2nd, 3rd Season |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543 |website=TV Shows on DVD |last=Lambert |first=David |date=September 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929234612/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543 |archivedate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> The role of Buster Bunny was given to [[Charlie Adler]], who gave the role, as producer [[Tom Ruegger]] said, \"a great deal of energy\".<ref name=\"creation\"/> The role of Babs Bunny was given to [[Tress MacNeille]]. Writer [[Paul Dini]] said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs' voice and the voices of her impressions.<ref name=\"creation\"/> Voice actors [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Don Messick]] were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. [[Danny Cooksey]] played Montana Max and, according to [[Paul Dini]], was good for the role because he could do a \"tremendous mean voice.\" Cooksey was also the only voice actor in the cast who was not an adult.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Cree Summer]] played the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Gail Matthius]] played Shirley the Loon, and [[Kath Soucie]] had the roles of Fifi La Fume and Li'l Sneezer. Other actors for the series included [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the voice of Dizzy Devil; [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Sweetie, [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Barky Marky, and other voices; and [[Rob Paulsen]] as the voice of Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor, and other characters. The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, [[Mel Blanc]], was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were recast by the likes of [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Greg Burson]], and Mel's son, [[Noel Blanc]].\n\nDuring production of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset that he had not landed a role in ''[[Animaniacs]]'' while voice actors with smaller roles in ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in the new series.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/> [[John Kassir]] replaced Adler for the remainder of the show's run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe]]''). Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nIn order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] contracted several different [[North American]] and international animation houses. These animation studios included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], Encore Cartoons, [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>{{cite news |last=Owens |first=John |title=Drawing On Experience |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon |accessdate=1 October 2011 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=July 5, 1992 |location= [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |issn=2165-171X |oclc=60639020}}</ref> and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].<ref>Credits from various ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}</ref> Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series' opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio's inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subject to multiple re-takes. In other cases, such as the debut episode \"The Looney Beginning\", portions of Kennedy Cartoons-animated episodes were re-animated by another animation studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\">{{cite web |url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html |title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger!

It had a [[cel]] count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then.<ref name=\"creation\"/> The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Pierre DeCelles]], an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as \"fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop\".\n\n===Music===\nDuring the development of the show [[Steven Spielberg]] said that [[Warner Bros.]] would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. [[Warner Bros.]] selected [[Bruce Broughton]] to write the theme tune (for which he would win a [[Daytime Emmy]] along with [[Tom Ruegger]] and [[Wayne Kaatz]], who both worked with Broughton on the lyrics) and serve as [[music supervisor]]. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.\n\nTwenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each different episode during the series run: Julie and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steve Bernstein]], [[Steven Bramson]], [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], [[John Debney]], Ron Grant, [[Les Hooper]], Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, [[Hummie Mann]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], [[Joel McNeely]], Peter Myers, [[Laurence Rosenthal]], [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]], J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, [[Fred Steiner]], [[Morton Stevens]], [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [[Stephen James Taylor]] and [[Mark Watters]]. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.\n\nThese composers would later write the musical scores for shows including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]].''\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1990-1992)\n** [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1992-1995)\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] \u2013 Plucky Duck\n* [[Danny Cooksey]] \u2013 Montana Max\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] \u2013 Dizzy Devil \n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Babs Bunny\n* [[Gail Matthius]] \u2013 Shirley the Loon\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Hamton J.

Animation]] department,\" and at the same time create a series with junior versions of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters|Looney Tunes characters]]. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' where the characters were either young versions of the original ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters or new characters as the offspring of the original characters.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Bob |title=NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity & hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters |magazine=[[Comic Scene]] |publisher=[[Starlog|Starlog Group]] |issue=15 |pages=33\u201339, 68 |date=1990}}</ref> The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which ''Tiny Toons'' was produced for had such cartoons as ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Tom & Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones Kids]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] chose to do the same because Spielberg wanted to make a series similar to ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: \"Well, I think in [[Warner Bros.]] case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn't want to just work on characters that [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Robert McKimson|Bob McKimson]] and [[Bob Clampett]] made famous and created. He wanted to be involved with the creation of some ''new'' characters.\" The result was a series similar to ''Looney Tunes'' without the use of the same characters.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 20, 1987,<ref name=\"collab2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318258,00.html |title=SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH!

Animation studio approached [[Steven Spielberg]] to collaborate with Semel and [[Warner Bros.]] head of licensing Dan Romanelli on Semel's ideas.<ref name=\"creation\"/> They eventually decided that the new characters would be similar to the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters with no direct relation. However, ''Tiny Toons'' did not go into production then, nor was it even planned to be made for television; the series initially was to be a [[theatrical]] [[feature-length film]].<ref name=\"collab\"/><ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn December 27, 1988, ''Tiny Toons'' was changed from a film to a television series, with [[Jean MacCurdy]] overseeing production of the first 65 episodes.<ref name=\"creation\"/> MacCurdy said that ''Tiny Toons'' was changed to a television series to \"reach a broader audience\".<ref name=\"collab\"/> For the series, MacCurdy hired [[Tom Ruegger]], who previously wrote cartoons for [[Filmation]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], to be a producer.<ref name=\"creation\"/> In January 1989, Ruegger and writer [[Wayne Kaatz]] began developing the characters and the setting of \"Acme Acres\" with Spielberg.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 9, 1989, [[Warner Bros.

The characters attend '''Acme Looniversity''', a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons, such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.\n\nLike the [[Looney Tunes]], the series makes use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] (e.g. [[Anvil#Television and film|anvils]] falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and [[slapstick]]. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and [[Hollywood]] culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of [[ecology]], [[self-esteem]], and [[crime]].\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters}}\n[[Image:Promo tiny toon .jpg|left|thumb|210px|Artwork displaying a majority of the [[List of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures|''Tiny Toon'' cast]].]]\n<!--please don't re-add the list to this section; see talk page-->\nThe series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] [[Acme Looniversity|Looniversity]] to be the next generation of ''Looney Tunes'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: [[Buster Bunny]], a blue male rabbit, and [[Babs Bunny]], a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include [[Fifi La Fume]], a purple-and-white female skunk; [[Shirley The Loon]], a white female [[loon]]; [[Dizzy Devil]], a purple tasmanian devil; [[Furrball]], a blue cat; [[Sweetie Pie (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Sweetie Pie]], a pink canary; [[Calamity Coyote]], a bluish-gray coyote; [[Little Beeper]], a red-orange roadrunner; and [[Gogo Dodo]], a zany green dodo. Two human characters, [[Montana Max]] and [[Elmyra Duff]], are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included [[Li'l Sneezer]], a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; [[Concord Condor]], a purple condor; [[Byron Basset]], a usually sleeping basset hound; [[Bookworm (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Bookworm]], a green worm with glasses; [[Arnold the Pit Bull]], a muscular white pit bull; [[Fowlmouth]], a white rooster with horrid language; [[Barky Marky]], a brown dog, and [[Mary Melody]], a young African American human girl.\n\nFeeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig among others. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writers===\nThe series and the show's characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader [[Jean MacCurdy]], associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer [[Wayne Kaatz]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, and many other artists and directors. The series was actually planned to be a feature film. Once Steven Spielberg was attached, numerous things changed, including the idea of turning the movie into a television series.\n\n\"Buster and Babs Go To Hawaii\" was co-written by three then-teenage girls who were fans of the show.<ref name=writers>{{cite news|last=Berkman|first=Meredith|title=Adventures among the 'Toons'|url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,313220,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] issue #51|date=February 1, 1991|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n===Casting info===\nVoice director [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] auditioned over 1,200 voices for the series and chose more than a dozen main voice actors.<ref name=\"collab\">{{cite web|title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Long-Awaited 'Volume 3' DVD Brings Toons from 2nd, 3rd Season|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|last=Lambert|first=David|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929234612/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|archivedate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> The role of Buster Bunny was given to [[Charlie Adler]], who gave the role, as producer [[Tom Ruegger]] said, \"a great deal of energy\".<ref name=\"creation\"/> The role of Babs Bunny was given to [[Tress MacNeille]]. Writer [[Paul Dini]] said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs' voice and the voices of her impressions.<ref name=\"creation\"/> Voice actors [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Don Messick]] were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. [[Danny Cooksey]] played Montana Max and, according to [[Paul Dini]], was good for the role because he could do a \"tremendous mean voice.\" Cooksey was also the only voice actor in the cast who was not an adult.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Cree Summer]] played the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Gail Matthius]] played Shirley the Loon, and [[Kath Soucie]] had the roles of Fifi La Fume and Li'l Sneezer. Other actors for the series included [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the voice of Dizzy Devil; [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Sweetie, [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Barky Marky, and other voices; and [[Rob Paulsen]] as the voice of Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor, and other characters. The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, [[Mel Blanc]], was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were recast by the likes of [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Greg Burson]], and Mel's son, [[Noel Blanc]].\n\nDuring production of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset that he had not landed a role in ''[[Animaniacs]]'' while voice actors with smaller roles in ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in the new series.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/> [[John Kassir]] replaced Adler for the remainder of the show's run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe]]''). Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nIn order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] contracted several different [[North American]] and international animation houses. These animation studios included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], Encore Cartoons, [[StarToons]],<ref name=startoons>{{cite news|last=Owens|first=John|title=Drawing On Experience|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1992}}</ref> and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].<ref>Credits from various ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}</ref> Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series' opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio's inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subject to multiple re-takes. In other cases, such as the debut episode \"The Looney Beginning\", portions of Kennedy Cartoons-animated episodes were re-animated by another animation studio.<ref name=\"kennedy\">{{cite web|url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger!

It had a [[cel]] count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then.<ref name=\"creation\"/> The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.<ref name=\"creation\"/> [[Pierre DeCelles]], an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as \"fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop\".\n\n===Music===\nDuring the development of the show [[Steven Spielberg]] said that [[Warner Bros.]] would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. [[Warner Bros.]] selected [[Bruce Broughton]] to write the theme tune (for which he would win a [[Daytime Emmy]] along with [[Tom Ruegger]] and [[Wayne Kaatz]], who both worked with Broughton on the lyrics) and serve as [[music supervisor]]. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.\n\nTwenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each different episode during the series run: Julie and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steve Bernstein]], [[Steven Bramson]], [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], [[John Debney]], Ron Grant, [[Les Hooper]], Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, [[Hummie Mann]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], [[Joel McNeely]], Peter Myers, [[Laurence Rosenthal]], [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]], J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, [[Fred Steiner]], [[Morton Stevens]], [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [[Stephen James Taylor]] and [[Mark Watters]]. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.\n\nThese composers would later write the musical scores for shows including ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries]].''\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n{{:List of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Charlie Adler]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1990-1992)\n** [[John Kassir]] \u2013 Buster Bunny (1992-1995)\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] \u2013 Plucky Duck\n* [[Danny Cooksey]] \u2013 Montana Max\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] \u2013 Dizzy Devil \n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Babs Bunny\n* [[Gail Matthius]] \u2013 Shirley the Loon\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Hamton J.

Animation]] department,\" and at the same time create a series with junior versions of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters|Looney Tunes characters]]. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' where the characters were either young versions of the original ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters or new characters as the offspring of the original characters.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Bob|title=NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity & hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters|periodical=Comic Scene|issue=15|pages=33\u201339, 68|year=1990}}</ref> The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which ''Tiny Toons'' was produced for had such cartoons as ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Tom & Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones Kids]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] chose to do the same because Spielberg wanted to make a series similar to ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: \"Well, I think in [[Warner Bros.]] case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn't want to just work on characters that [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Robert McKimson|Bob McKimson]] and [[Bob Clampett]] made famous and created. He wanted to be involved with the creation of some ''new'' characters.\" The result was a series similar to ''Looney Tunes'' without the use of the same characters.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 20, 1987,<ref name=\"collab2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318258,00.html|title=SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH!

Animation studio approached [[Steven Spielberg]] to collaborate with Semel and [[Warner Bros.]] head of licensing Dan Romanelli on Semel's ideas.<ref name=\"creation\"/> They eventually decided that the new characters would be similar to the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters with no direct relation. However, ''Tiny Toons'' did not go into production then, nor was it even planned to be made for television; the series initially was to be a [[theatrical]] [[feature-length film]].<ref name=\"collab\"/><ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn December 27, 1988, ''Tiny Toons'' was changed from a film to a television series, with [[Jean MacCurdy]] overseeing production of the first 65 episodes.<ref name=\"creation\"/> MacCurdy said that ''Tiny Toons'' was changed to a television series to \"reach a broader audience\".<ref name=\"collab\"/> For the series, MacCurdy hired [[Tom Ruegger]], who previously wrote cartoons for [[Filmation]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], to be a producer.<ref name=\"creation\"/> In January 1989, Ruegger and writer [[Wayne Kaatz]] began developing the characters and the setting of \"Acme Acres\" with Spielberg.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nOn January 9, 1989, [[Warner Bros.

The water channel flow rates are listed in cubic feet per second.]]\n\nWater from the Mississippi is normally diverted into the Atchafalaya Basin at only one place, the [[Old River Control Structure]] (ORCS), in use since 1963, where floodgates are routinely used to redirect the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya River such that the volume of the two rivers is split 70%/30%, respectively, as measured at the latitude of [[Red River Landing]]. During the 1973 Mississippi flood, the ORCS was being damaged due to high flow rates, leading to the opening of the Morganza Spillway to help relieve this pressure. Subsequently, the nearby Old River Control Auxiliary Structure (ORCAS) was constructed, adding additional floodgates for use during major floods.\n\nThe Morganza Spillway, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downriver from ORCS and ORCAS, is designed for emergency use to divert additional water from the Mississippi River into the Morganza floodway, which merges downstream with the Atchafalaya floodway before entering the Gulf. Diversion of water from the Mississippi's main channel has the effect of lowering water level in the Mississippi downstream of the spillway, helping to relieve stress on levees and other flood control structures both upstream and down. Besides controlling flooding in a given event, the system is also designed to prevent the Mississippi River from permanently altering course down the Atchafalaya River, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.<ref name='USACE' /><ref name=\"AmericasWetlands\" /><ref name='Weeks' /><ref name=\"InteractiveMap\" />\n\nWater that passes the Morganza Spillway first enters the Morganza Floodway, which extends from the spillway at the Mississippi River south to the East Atchafalaya River levee. The floodway, {{convert|20|mi}} long and {{convert|5|mi}} wide, includes a stilling basin, an approach channel, an outlet channel, and two guide [[levee]]s.<ref name='USACE' /> From there, diverted water enters the [[Atchafalaya River Basin]] Floodway near [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]],<ref name='USACE' /> and continues to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn an extreme flood event, a major release of water from the Morganza Spillway into the Morganza Floodway and Atchafalaya Basin inundates not only the floodways themselves (between their levees), but extensive additional areas of southern Louisiana throughout the [[Atchafalaya Basin]]. In such an event, the water level of the Mississippi, high enough to overtop the Spillway, would already be flooding some areas in the Basin downstream of the spillway, due to increased flow through the ORCS and the ORCAS, as well as possible overtopping of levees near the spillway.<ref name=\"2008leveetopped\" /> This flooding, plus any additional water from a Morganza Spillway release, together determine the total extent of flooding throughout the Atchafalaya Basin during a major Mississippi River flood.\n\nAt risk in the Atchafalaya Basin are [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] (population 13,500), various smaller populated places, many farms, thousands of oil and gas wells, and considerable swampland. Inhabitants know that the region is a natural [[floodplain]], and the Corps of Engineers issues written notices annually to all interests reminding them of the possibility that it might open the spillway and flood the area.  Any decision to open the spillway must be carefully planned to give ample warning and protect life and property.   Part of that planning process includes the Corps' preparation of maps known as \"inundation scenarios\" so that interested parties can discuss how much water, if any, should be allowed through the spillway.<ref name='USACE' /><ref name=TP1>{{cite web|last=Schliefstein|first=Mark|title=Record high river likely to require opening of Morganza Spillway next week (May 4, 2011, revised May 9, 2011)|url=http://www.nola.com/weather/index.ssf/2011/05/record_high_river_likely_to_re.html|publisher=The Times-Picayune (New Orleans)|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=TP2>{{cite web|last=Schliefstein|first=Mark|title=Morganza Spillway might be opened to ease swollen Mississippi River (May 8, 2011, revised May 9, 2011)|url=http://www.nola.com/weather/index.ssf/2011/05/morganza_spillway_might_be_ope.html|publisher=The Times-Picayune (New Orleans)|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20110510/NEWS01/105100316 Morganza Spillway expected to open soon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001342/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20110510/NEWS01/105100316 |date=2011-05-14 }}, ''The News Star'': May 9, 2011, Mike Hasten</ref><ref>[http://www.batonrougetoday.com/2011/05/06/gov-jindal-asks-army-corps-to-release-map-outlining-impact-of-possible-opening-of-morganza-spillway-says-state-continues-to-prepare-for-flooding/ Gov.

The water channel flow rates are listed in cubic feet per second.]]\n\nWater from the Mississippi is normally diverted into the Atchafalaya Basin at only one place, the [[Old River Control Structure]] (ORCS), in use since 1963, where floodgates are routinely used to redirect the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya River such that the volume of the two rivers is split 70%/30%, respectively, as measured at the latitude of [[Red River Landing]]. During the 1973 Mississippi flood, the ORCS was being damaged due to high flow rates, leading to the opening of the Morganza Spillway to help relieve this pressure. Subsequently, the nearby Old River Control Auxiliary Structure (ORCAS) was constructed, adding additional floodgates for use during major floods.\n\nThe Morganza Spillway, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downriver from ORCS and ORCAS, is designed for emergency use to divert additional water from the Mississippi River into the Morganza floodway, which merges downstream with the Atchafalaya floodway before entering the Gulf. Diversion of water from the Mississippi's main channel has the effect of lowering water level in the Mississippi downstream of the spillway, helping to relieve stress on levees and other flood control structures both upstream and down. Besides controlling flooding in a given event, the system is also designed to prevent the Mississippi River from permanently altering course down the Atchafalaya River, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.<ref name='USACE' /><ref name=\"AmericasWetlands\" /><ref name='Weeks' /><ref name=\"InteractiveMap\" />\n\nWater that passes the Morganza Spillway first enters the Morganza Floodway, which extends from the spillway at the Mississippi River south to the East Atchafalaya River levee. The floodway, {{convert|20|mi}} long and {{convert|5|mi}} wide, includes a stilling basin, an approach channel, an outlet channel, and two guide [[levee]]s.<ref name='USACE' /> From there, diverted water enters the [[Atchafalaya River Basin]] Floodway near [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]],<ref name='USACE' /> and continues to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn an extreme flood event, a major release of water from the Morganza Spillway into the Morganza Floodway and Atchafalaya Basin inundates not only the floodways themselves (between their levees), but extensive additional areas of southern Louisiana throughout the [[Atchafalaya Basin]]. In such an event, the water level of the Mississippi, high enough to overtop the Spillway, would already be flooding some areas in the Basin downstream of the spillway, due to increased flow through the ORCS and the ORCAS, as well as possible overtopping of levees near the spillway.<ref name=\"2008leveetopped\" /> This flooding, plus any additional water from a Morganza Spillway release, together determine the total extent of flooding throughout the Atchafalaya Basin during a major Mississippi River flood.\n\nAt risk in the Atchafalaya Basin are [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] (population 13,500), various smaller populated places, many farms, thousands of oil and gas wells, and considerable swampland. Inhabitants know that the region is a natural [[floodplain]], and the Corps of Engineers issues written notices annually to all interests reminding them of the possibility that it might open the spillway and flood the area.  Any decision to open the spillway must be carefully planned to give ample warning and protect life and property.

{"title_page": "Intake ramp", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2015}}\nAn '''intake ramp''' is a rectangular, plate-like device within the [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air intake]] of a [[jet engine]], designed to generate a number of [[shock wave]]s to aid the inlet compression process at [[supersonic]] speeds. The ramp sits at an acute angle to deflect the intake air from the longitudinal direction. At [[supersonic]] flight speeds, the deflection of the air stream creates a number of oblique shock waves at each change of gradient along at the ramp. Air crossing each shock wave suddenly slows to a lower [[Mach number]], thus increasing [[pressure]].\n\nIdeally, the first oblique shock wave should intercept the air intake lip, thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry drag on the outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because the angle of the shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.\n\nMore advanced supersonic intakes feature a ramp with a number of discrete changes of gradient in order to generate multiple oblique shock waves. In the case of [[Concorde]], the first (converging) intake ramp is followed by a diverging ramp. After the air passes the end of the first ramp it has become subsonic such that the diverging ramp further contributes towards the reduction in airstream velocity and consequently its increase in pressure.

The ramp sits at an acute angle to deflect the intake air from the longitudinal direction. At [[supersonic]] flight speeds, the deflection of the air stream creates a number of oblique shock waves at each change of gradient along at the ramp. Air crossing each shock wave suddenly slows to a lower [[Mach number]], thus increasing [[pressure]].\n\nIdeally, the first oblique shock wave should intercept the air intake lip, thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry drag on the outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because the angle of the shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.\n\nMore advanced supersonic intakes feature a ramp with a number of discrete changes of gradient in order to generate multiple oblique shock waves. In the case of [[Concorde]], the first (converging) intake ramp is followed by a diverging ramp. After the air passes the end of the first ramp it has become subsonic such that the diverging ramp further contributes towards the reduction in airstream velocity and consequently its increase in pressure. This intake design thus ensures excellent pressure recovery and contributes to Concorde's improved fuel efficiency whilst [[Supercruise|cruising supersonically]] at up to Mach 2.2 (beyond which airframe heating effects limit any further increase in speed).\n\nFor a fixed geometry it is feasible to use curved intakes without any shocks before the final normal shock.\nModern fighter jets (like the [[F-22 Raptor]]) have engines so powerful that top speed is not limited by them,\nthus spillage at the intake is acceptable and a lightweight fixed geometry chosen.
