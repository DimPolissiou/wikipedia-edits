In 2019, the game was included on the [[Sega Genesis Mini|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Mini]] console.\n\nIn 1996, a sequel, titled ''[[Vectorman 2]]'', was released.\n\n==Games==\n\n===''Vectorman''===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Vectorman\n| image = Vectorman cover.jpg\n| caption = North American cover art\n| developer = [[BlueSky Software]]\n| publisher = [[Sega]]\n| producer = Jerry Markota <br> Jenny Cleary\n| designer = Rich Karpp <br> [[Mark Lorenzen]]\n| composer = Jon Holland\n| released = {{vgrelease|NA|October 24, 1995|EU|November 30, 1995}}\n| genre = [[Platform game|Platform]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n| platforms = [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]]\n}}\n\n==== Story ====\nIn 2049, the human population of [[Earth]] embarks on a migratory voyage to try to colonize other planets. They leave mechanical \"orbots\" to clean up the mess they made on Earth through [[litter]]ing and [[pollution]]. Raster, a high-level orbot who watches Earth through a planetwide computer network, is accidentally attached to a working [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming an evil dictator named Warhead. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and begins preparing to execute any humans who dare return to their planet.\n\nEnter Vectorman, a humble orbot in charge of cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. As he lands on Earth after his last trip, he finds chaos and confusion. Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead (Vectorman having not been affected because he was away), Vectorman takes it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth.\n\n==== Graphics and gameplay ====\n''Vectorman'' uses [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[3D computer graphics|3D models]] in its level and character designs. This gives the game a smooth, computer-generated feel. The original name of the villain, Warhead, was Raster (as in [[raster graphics]], the opposite of [[vector graphics]]). Vectorman was considered the answer to Nintendo's [[Donkey Kong Country]] at the time, as they both used graphical tricks to show graphics beyond what the console was thought capable of.\n\nThe game itself is a straightforward [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Action game|action]] platformer. Vectorman is an \"orbot\" (a robot whose body is composed almost entirely of [[Sphere|orbs]]) powered with a ball gun in his hand; power-ups include a [[machine gun]], \"bolo\" gun, and triple-fire guns.\n\nVectorman possesses the ability to transform, through the use of power-ups, into several different forms: including a drill, to cut through floors; a bomb, to destroy all surrounding enemies or breakable walls; and an aquatic form, useful for swimming underwater. In addition to power-up transformations, three levels host unique morphed forms with which to combat bosses in. Overall, the game consists of 16 levels.\n\n==== Development ====\n''Vectorman'' introduced the then-new Genesis programming technique referred to by Sega as Vector Piece Animation.<ref name=\"GPro882\">{{cite magazine|author=The Whizz|date=January 1996|title=Sega Vectors in on Better Genesis Programming|magazine=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|issue=88|page=28}}</ref> The player character's body actually consists of 23 individual sprites programmed to move in unison.<ref name=\"GPro882\" />\n\n==== Reception ====\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the first ''Vectorman'' a score of 8.25 out of 10, unanimously praising the advanced graphics and animation, large levels with numerous hidden areas, strong audio, and ability to change into different forms.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=November 1995|title=Review Crew: Vectorman|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=Sendai Publishing|issue=76|page=42}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Scary Larry gave it a rave review, stating that \"your jaw will hang open in amazement at what Vectorman does with the 16-bit Genesis engine.

Vectorman escapes, parachuting down to the planet to battle with the Earth's multitudinous enemy; [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[Insect|insects]]. Now it is up to Vectorman to fight through the mutant bugs and find the most fearsome source infestation; the evil [[Latrodectus|Black Widow]] [[Gyne|Queen]].\n\n====Graphics and gameplay====\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous game.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vectorman 2: So Much Trash, So Little Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |pages=256\u20137}}</ref> Vectorman has a different set of weapons, including a pulse beam, energy shot, and super shot guns. Vectorman can also now transform into animal forms such as a fire ant, a rhino, and a \"shield bug\" that repels attacks. Unlike the original ''Vectorman'', the full-level transformations featured in this game are not used to combat bosses as that is left to the human-form Vectorman. There are 22 levels divided into seven parts in all.\n\nBefore ''Vectorman 2'' was released, [[Sega Channel]] held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph of Vectorman. Judges then chose the best one to be transformed in Genesis art, as well as being put on the Sega Channel. Ten runner-up submitters won a copy of ''Vectorman 2''.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Sega Channel Memories pt2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvC6RwA88Y|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n====Reception====\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' gave ''Vectorman 2'' a 7.25 out of 10. Shawn Smith, Dan Hsu, and Crispin Boyer applauded its traditional side-scrolling gameplay, huge levels, graphics, and animation, especially on the bosses. Sushi-X, in contrast, said that the levels are surprisingly small, making it a disappointment compared to the first game.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Vectorman 2|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=90}}</ref> Scary Larry gave it a 4.5/5 in graphics and a 5/5 in every other category.

In 2019, the game was included on the [[Sega Genesis Mini|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Mini]] console.\n\nIn 1996, a sequel, titled ''[[Vectorman 2]]'', was released.\n\n==Games==\n\n===''Vectorman''===\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Vectorman\n| image = Vectorman cover.jpg\n| caption = North American cover art\n| developer = [[BlueSky Software]]\n| publisher = [[Sega]]\n| producer = Jerry Markota <br> Jenny Cleary\n| designer = Rich Karpp <br> [[Mark Lorenzen]]\n| composer = Jon Holland\n| released = {{vgrelease|NA|October 24, 1995|EU|November 30, 1995}}\n| genre = [[Platform game|Platform]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n| platforms = [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]]\n}}\n\n=== Story ===\nIn 2049, the human population of [[Earth]] embarks on a migratory voyage to try to colonize other planets. They leave mechanical \"orbots\" to clean up the mess they made on Earth through [[litter]]ing and [[pollution]]. Raster, a high-level orbot who watches Earth through a planetwide computer network, is accidentally attached to a working [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] by a lesser orbot and goes insane, becoming an evil dictator named Warhead. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and begins preparing to execute any humans who dare return to their planet.\n\nEnter Vectorman, a humble orbot in charge of cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. As he lands on Earth after his last trip, he finds chaos and confusion. Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead (Vectorman having not been affected because he was away), Vectorman takes it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth.\n\n=== Graphics and gameplay ===\n''Vectorman'' uses [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[3D computer graphics|3D models]] in its level and character designs. This gives the game a smooth, computer-generated feel. The original name of the villain, Warhead, was Raster (as in [[raster graphics]], the opposite of [[vector graphics]]). Vectorman was considered the answer to Nintendo's [[Donkey Kong Country]] at the time, as they both used graphical tricks to show graphics beyond what the console was thought capable of.\n\nThe game itself is a straightforward [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Action game|action]] platformer. Vectorman is an \"orbot\" (a robot whose body is composed almost entirely of [[Sphere|orbs]]) powered with a ball gun in his hand; power-ups include a [[machine gun]], \"bolo\" gun, and triple-fire guns.\n\nVectorman possesses the ability to transform, through the use of power-ups, into several different forms: including a drill, to cut through floors; a bomb, to destroy all surrounding enemies or breakable walls; and an aquatic form, useful for swimming underwater. In addition to power-up transformations, three levels host unique morphed forms with which to combat bosses in. Overall, the game consists of 16 levels.\n\n=== Development ===\n''Vectorman'' introduced the then-new Genesis programming technique referred to by Sega as Vector Piece Animation.<ref name=\"GPro882\">{{cite magazine|author=The Whizz|date=January 1996|title=Sega Vectors in on Better Genesis Programming|magazine=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|issue=88|page=28}}</ref> The player character's body actually consists of 23 individual sprites programmed to move in unison.<ref name=\"GPro882\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the first ''Vectorman'' a score of 8.25 out of 10, unanimously praising the advanced graphics and animation, large levels with numerous hidden areas, strong audio, and ability to change into different forms.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=November 1995|title=Review Crew: Vectorman|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=Sendai Publishing|issue=76|page=42}}</ref> ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Scary Larry gave it a rave review, stating that \"your jaw will hang open in amazement at what Vectorman does with the 16-bit Genesis engine.

Vectorman escapes, parachuting down to the planet to battle with the Earth's multitudinous enemy; [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[Insect|insects]]. Now it is up to Vectorman to fight through the mutant bugs and find the most fearsome source infestation; the evil [[Latrodectus|Black Widow]] [[Gyne|Queen]].\n\n===Graphics and gameplay===\nThe gameplay is similar to the previous game.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Vectorman 2: So Much Trash, So Little Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |pages=256\u20137}}</ref> Vectorman has a different set of weapons, including a pulse beam, energy shot, and super shot guns. Vectorman can also now transform into animal forms such as a fire ant, a rhino, and a \"shield bug\" that repels attacks. Unlike the original ''Vectorman'', the full-level transformations featured in this game are not used to combat bosses as that is left to the human-form Vectorman. There are 22 levels divided into seven parts in all.\n\nBefore ''Vectorman 2'' was released, [[Sega Channel]] held a contest that allowed artists to draw a morph of Vectorman. Judges then chose the best one to be transformed in Genesis art, as well as being put on the Sega Channel. Ten runner-up submitters won a copy of ''Vectorman 2''.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Sega Channel Memories pt2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bvC6RwA88Y|date=2007-06-10|accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' gave ''Vectorman 2'' a 7.25 out of 10. Shawn Smith, Dan Hsu, and Crispin Boyer applauded its traditional side-scrolling gameplay, huge levels, graphics, and animation, especially on the bosses. Sushi-X, in contrast, said that the levels are surprisingly small, making it a disappointment compared to the first game.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Vectorman 2|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=90}}</ref> Scary Larry gave it a 4.5/5 in graphics and a 5/5 in every other category.

The examination of the dentistry of ''[[Arsinoea]]'' by Seiffert et al. led them to consider that ''Arsinoea'' may or may not be a parapithecid, although certainly parapithecoidal, and suggest that ''Arsinoea kallimos'' be treated as '[[incertae sedis]]' within parapithecoidea. They separate the genus ''[[Qatrania]]'' into two, ''Abuqatrania'' for ''Qatrania basiodontos'' and ''Qatrania'' for the remaining species, and offer some support for Simons 2001 suggestion that ''Qatrania''/''Abuqatrania basiodontos'' may be ancestral to all other Parapithecidae, in particular noting that the fossils are 1 million years older than the next oldest parapithecid, ''Qatrania wingi''.<ref name=seiffert />\n\nKay and Williams (2013, edited by Feagle and Kay), look at possible hypotheses about Parapithecidae:<br>\n- that they and [[Propliopithecoidea|Propliopithecidae]] are closely related, with their common ancestor being related to ''[[Oligopithecus]]'' and the common ancestor of all three being related to the [[platyrrhines]] with more recent [[catarrhines]] (i.e. [[Cercopithecoidea]] and [[Hominoidea]]) being descended from the Propliopithecidae;<br>\n- or that Parapithecidae and Propliopithecidae are closely related but their common ancestor is closely related to the platyrrhines and the common ancestor of all three being related to ''Oligopithecus'' with more recent catarrhines again being descended from the Propliopithecidae; <br>\n- or that Propliopithecidae and ''Oligopithecus'' are closely related, and Parapithecicae are related to the common ancestor of both and the common ancestor of all three is related to the [[platyrrhines]], with Cercopithecoidea being descended from the Parapithecidae and Hominoidea being descended from Propliopithecidae.<ref name=kay1>Richard F.

The examination of the dentistry of ''[[Arsinoea]]'' by Seiffert et al. led them to consider that ''Arsinoea'' may or may not be a parapithecid, although certainly parapithecoidal, and suggest that ''Arsinoea kallimos'' be treated as '[[incertae sedis]]' within parapithecoidea. They separate the genus ''[[Qatrania]]'' into two, ''Abuqatrania'' for ''Qatrania basiodontos'' and ''Qatrania'' for the remaining species, and offer some support for Simons 2001 suggestion that ''Qatrania''/''Abuqatrania basiodontos'' may be ancestral to all other Parapithecidae, in particular noting that the fossils are 1 million years older than the next oldest parapithecid, ''Qatrania wingi''.<ref name=seiffert />\n\nKay and Williams (2013, edited by Feagle and Kay), look at possible hypotheses about Parapithecidae:<br>\n- that they and [[Propliopithecoidea|Propliopithecidae]] are closely related, with their common ancestor being related to ''[[Oligopithecus]]'' and the common ancestor of all three being related to the [[platyrrhines]] with more recent [[catarrhines]] (i.e. [[Cercopithecoidea]] and [[Hominoidea]]) being descended from the Propliopithecidae;<br>\n- or that Parapithecidae and Propliopithecidae are closely related but their common ancestor is closely related to the platyrrhines and the common ancestor of all three being related to ''Oligopithecus'' with more recent catarrhines again being descended from the Propliopithecidae; <br>\n- or that Propliopithecidae and ''Oligopithecus'' are closely related, and Parapithecicae are related to the common ancestor of both and the common ancestor of all three is related to the [[platyrrhines]], with Cercopithecoidea being descended from the Parapithecidae and Hominoidea being descended from Propliopithecidae.<ref name=kay1>Richard F.

{"title_page": "Vizing's theorem", "text_new": "In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's theorem''' states that every simple [[undirected graph]] may be [[edge coloring|edge colored]] using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|\u0394}} of the graph.\nAt least {{math|\u0394}} colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394}} colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors are necessary.\nA more generalized version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected [[multigraph]] without loops can be colored with at most {{math|\u0394+\u00b5}} colors, where {{math|\u00b5}} is the [[glossary of graph theory terms#multigraph|multiplicity]] of the multigraph.\nThe theorem is named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.

(In Russian.)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=6932 Proof of Vizing's theorem] at [[PlanetMath]].\n\n[[Category:Graph coloring]]\n[[Category:Theorems in graph theory]]\n", "text_old": "In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's theorem''' states that every simple [[undirected graph]] may be [[edge coloring|edge colored]] using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|\u0394}} of the graph.\nAt least {{math|\u0394}} colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394}} colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors are necessary.\nA more generalized version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected [[multigraph]] without loops can be colored with at most {{math|\u0394+\u00b5}} colors, where {{math|\u00b5}} is the [[glossary of graph theory terms#multiplicity|multiplicity]] of the multigraph.\nThe theorem is named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.
