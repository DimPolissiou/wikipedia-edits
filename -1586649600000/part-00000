Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n11 out of 16 [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams showed interest in Richardson, as well as the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Georgia Tech University]], which offered baseball scholarships. [[Mayo Smith]], manager of the [[Norfolk Tars]], a team in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]] and an affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris.

(Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the seventh and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5\u20132 on [[Tim McCarver]]'s 10th inning, three-run home run.\n\n===Legacy===\nRichardson racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s.

He led the Gamecocks to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 51\u20136\u20131 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever.  They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today.\n\nRichardson ran for the [[United States Congress]] from [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]] in 1976 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], losing to incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]] by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Bob Feller]], and [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell]] among others.  Richardson's old friend, Yankee shortstop [[Tony Kubek]], declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite book |title=October 1964 |last= Halberstam |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |location= |isbn= 0-449-98367-6 |page= |pages=366\u2013367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ7sUkp5eBcC&lpg=PP1&dq=october%201964&pg=PA366#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]] and also for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338).\n\nRichardson is a [[born-again Christian]].

Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]].

His career high was 692 at bats in 161 games in 1962.\n\nDuring the 1963 season, Richardson's father suffered a stroke in May, then died on July 17. Richardson missed 11 games during the year visiting him and helping get his affairs in order.<ref name=\"SABR\"/><ref name=\"Richardson's father\"/>\n\nHe had an all-time [[fielding percentage]] of .979 at second base, and six seasons with 100 or more double plays turned.\n\n===Postseason===\nRichardson won three [[World Series]] ([[1958 World Series|1958]], [[1961 World Series|1961]], [[1962 World Series|1962]]) of the seven he played with the Yankees ([[1957 World Series|1957]], 1958, [[1960 World Series|1960]], 1961, 1962, [[1963 World Series|1963]], [[1964 World Series|1964]]). In the 1960 Series, Richardson was named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] after hitting .367 with 12 RBIs, becoming the first non-pitcher to earn the relatively new award, and is to this day the only MVP to play for the losing team.

(Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out twice in one game.\n\nIn the [[1964 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since been tied by [[Lou Brock]] and [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]] in the [[1968 World Series|1968]] and [[1986 World Series]], respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the seventh and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5\u20132 on [[Tim McCarver]]'s 10th inning, three-run home run.\n\n===Legacy===\nRichardson racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s. Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]] and 73 [[stolen base]]s. He also had 196 [[double (baseball)|double]]s and 37 [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s.\n\nRichardson won a [[List of Gold Glove Award winners at second base|Gold Glove at second base]] each year from 1961\u201365 (not until [[Robinson Can\u00f3]] in {{Baseball year|2010}} would another Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top [[double play]] combination with [[shortstop]] and roommate [[Tony Kubek]].

He led the Gamecocks to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 51\u20136\u20131 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever.  They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today.\n\nRichardson ran for the [[United States Congress]] from [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]] in 1976 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], losing to incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Kenneth Lamar Holland|Kenneth Holland]] by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Bob Feller]], and [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell]] among others.  Richardson's old friend, Yankee shortstop [[Tony Kubek]], declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite book |title=October 1964 |last= Halberstam |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |location= |isbn= 0-449-98367-6 |page= |pages=366\u2013367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ7sUkp5eBcC&lpg=PP1&dq=october%201964&pg=PA366#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]] and also for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338).\n\nRichardson is a [[born-again Christian]].

She would astonishingly go undefeated in all of the 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyle events for over five years, only being broken with her shock defeat by [[Dagmar Hase]] in the 400-meter freestyle at the Barcelona Olympics, where she led for almost the entire race but was narrowly caught at the end.\n\nEvans won the 400-meter and 800-meter freestyle events at the U.S. National Championships 12 times each, the largest number of national titles in one event by an American swimmer in the 100-year history of the competition.\n\nEvans ended her swimming career, for all practical purposes, at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta, Georgia. She did not win any medals, but she did add one more highlight to her life.  She was given the honor of carrying the Olympic torch in the opening ceremony, and she handed the torch to the American boxing legend [[Muhammad Ali]] to light the cauldron. On July 27, 1996, she was in a building being interviewed by a German newsman when [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|a bomb]] exploded nearby. The explosion very lightly shook the building and startled Evans.\n\nIn the swimming pool, Evans finished ninth in the preliminaries of the 400-meter freestyle.

This record stood for 18 years until France's [[Laure Manaudou]] broke it in May 2006.\n\nEvans held the 1,500-meter freestyle record, set in March 1988, through June 2007, when it was broken by American [[Kate Ziegler]] with her time of 15:42.54.\n\nEvans held the world record in the 800-meter freestyle, 8:16:22, that she set in August 1989, until it was broken by [[Rebecca Adlington]] of Britain in August 2008.  Adlington set the new record with her time of 8:14.10 in winning the race at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  Evans's 800-meter record was one of the longest-standing ones ever in swimming, and it went unbroken through four Olympic Games (1992\u20132004).  Only the 100-meter freestyle swimming record set by the Dutch swimmer [[Willy den Ouden]] stood longer\u2014from 1936 through 1956, during a period when international competition was interrupted by world war.\n\nFollowing her outstanding performance of 1988, Evans continued to dominate the world's long-distance swimming competitions (400 meters and above).  Evans became the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic and world championship titles in any one swimming event by winning the 1988 and 1992 Olympic gold medals and the 1991 and 1994 world championships in the 800-meter freestyle race.  She would astonishingly go undefeated in all of the 400-, 800-, and 1500-meter freestyle events for over five years, only being broken with her shock defeat by [[Dagmar Hase]] in the 400-meter freestyle at the Barcelona Olympics, where she led for almost the entire race but was narrowly caught at the end.\n\nEvans won the 400-meter and 800-meter freestyle events at the U.S. National Championships 12 times each, the largest number of national titles in one event by an American swimmer in the 100-year history of the competition.\n\nEvans ended her swimming career, for all practical purposes, at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta, Georgia. She did not win any medals, but she did add one more highlight to her life.  She was given the honor of carrying the Olympic torch in the opening ceremony, and she handed the torch to the American boxing legend [[Muhammad Ali]] to light the cauldron. On July 27, 1996, she was in a building being interviewed by a German newsman when [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|a bomb]] exploded nearby. The explosion very lightly shook the building and startled Evans.\n\nIn the swimming pool, Evans finished ninth in the preliminaries of the 400-meter freestyle.  She did not qualify for the finals, as only the top eight finishers advance to the next level.  In the final swim of her career, Evans finished in sixth place in the 800-meter freestyle.\n\nAt the Atlanta Games, American swimming officials criticized Ireland's [[Michelle Smith]] about her unexpected gold medals,<ref>{{cite web|title=Speedo USA - Janet Evans Olympic Gold Medalist|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2014/03/janet-evans-olympic-gold-medalist/|date=March 13, 2014|publisher=[[Socialbilitty]]|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> suggesting that she might have been using performance-enhancing drugs.

While the comics portrayal of the team has no official command structure, in the early stories he is depicted as second-in-command. In the first issue, he is the one that killed the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] by knocking him and his grenade off the roof.  The second issue elaborated more on each turtles' personalities and opened with Donatello soldering a circuit. Later in the issue, Donatello states that he is \"familiar with some computer systems\" and helps [[April O'Neil]] deactivate the Mousers. During the turtles' exile to Northampton, Donatello becomes obsessed with fixing up and repairing the many broken things within the farmhouse they were living in. Most notably he spent days and nights fixing the boiler to give his family hot running water and builds a windmill and a water wheel to provide electricity. He also finds an old typewriter and writes his own personal credo.\n\nIn the ''Donatello'' [[One shot (comics)|one shot]], Donatello encounters an artist called Kirby (an homage to the comic artist [[Jack Kirby]]) whose mysterious crystal brings his drawings to life before disappearing. The two newfound friends journey to a dimension inhabited by Kirby's creations and help the heroes defeat the invading monsters.\n\nIn the ''Shades of Grey'' storyline, [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] encounters the turtle by a ravine as he was pondering \"the fractal structure of natural patterns\". Casey accuses the turtle of using big words and acting better than everyone else. Donatello suggests they should continue the conversation when Casey is sober. Grabbing a stick, an angry Jones continually pokes the turtle until he loses his temper and sends Casey careening into the water.\n\nIn the ''City at War'' storyline, the turtles return to New York to put an end to the Foot Clan's civil war. During a battle with Shredder's Elite Guards in the ruins of the Second Time Around Shop, Donatello falls through the floor and breaks his leg. Seeing their ally [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] subdued and about to be killed, Donatello grabs one of the Foot's machine guns and repeatedly shoots the Foot Elite. Donatello is visibly shaken by the violence and throws the gun away. At the end of the story the turtles, April and Casey move back to New York save for Donatello who chooses to stay in Northampton with [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Master Splinter]] to heal from his injury as well as reflect on everything that had happened. While meditating with Splinter, Donatello receives a vision of the future where he is in the village of Chihaya in Japan. When Donatello asks what he would be doing there, his master simply replies \"To bury me\". After encountering the turtle vigilante ally Nobody in civilian guise he returns with him to New York to help his brothers battle [[Baxter Stockman]].\n\nIn the current comics, Donatello finds an armored truck in the sewers which apparently had been part of a bank robbery in the sixties. Along with [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and Casey Jones, he undertakes the task of fixing up the vehicle. After the death of Splinter, Donatello secretly goes to his body and asks forgiveness before clipping something off him. Shortly after, Donatello decides to accompany the Utroms on a mission to [[Tepui]] to search for two missing research teams. The group are attacked by strange wooden creatures who shrink them to miniature size. The creatures turn out to be a group of Utroms which had been stranded in the Jungle during their first stay on Earth and had been living in secret thanks to their Quantum Inversion Redimensioning device which could alter their size. The process could not be reversed on Donatello, possibly due to his mutation, leaving him the size of an action figure. While the Utroms work on returning him to normal, Donatello put his new size to use infiltrating a terrorist organizations warehouse. He's also made a robotic body for him made to resemble a turtle to help him move around.\n\nThis incarnation of Donatello appeared in the ''[[Turtles Forever]]'' crossover special voiced by Christopher C. Adams.\n\n===Image Comics===\nIn the [[Image Comics]] incarnation of the [http://ninjaturtle.com TMNT], he became a [[cyborg]] after his body was partially destroyed after he was shot and dropped out of a [[helicopter]] (he maintained a positive attitude nonetheless, although he was constantly at risk of losing his mind to the cyborg half). He was supposedly killed by Image character Deathwatch by having his brain drained of mutagen. [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] blamed the cpu of Don's armor for his death; however, Donatello wasn't dead but was separated from his body, and with the help of his brothers he returned to his body. In the independent published series of the Image Comics, Issue #24, Don's armor began to malfunction and was so powerful Donatello was on his last legs until he made a deal with Baxter Stockman who Don was reluctant to work with but had no choice. Donatello is rid of most of his body metal by issue #25 and Baxter informs him his shell had regrown and as a result he was back to being a non-cyborg turtle. Baxter died once more when Don's metal particles wouldn't help restore his body as a result Baxter requested Donatello give April O'Neil his regards and he died laughing maniacally. Donatello then went on to battle Lady Shredder and the foot clan  with his brothers and Pimiko. Donatello was then by the end of the issue completely rid of all metal particles and had kept his and Baxter's ordeal a secret.\n\n===Archie Comics===\nDonatello's appearance in the Archie publications were largely based on the 1987 Fred Wolf incarnation, but with Mirage writers on board at ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures'' such as Steve Murphy and Ryan Brown, a lot of references to his Mirage counterpart were made. Donatello was showcased to be pure of heart and soul, being able to pass through the Netherworld unscathed. He was also chosen of the Turtles by a group of Aliens known as the Sons of Silence to share their wisdom. He was one of the few who could telepathically communicate with them. Donatello was almost a pacifist, detesting every time he used violence.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIn a shocking twist, Donatello was nearly killed at the end of issue #44 when Leonardo, Raphael and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] were on a mission to stop Krang from transforming the Earth using an alien device called the \"Technodrome\". Donatello was left at the home base, and while the others were away, he was attacked by [[Bebop and Rocksteady]]. After a brief fight, Rocksteady smashed Donatello's shell, nearly killing him.\n\nThe news of his supposed death spread all over the web and IGN did an interview with Tom Waltz, the script writer and he called the final scene a beautiful rendered scene, catching the emotion of the family. He also claimed there was no earthly way, Donatello could survive and he said it wasn't the end. Luckily, Donatello survived the onslaught.\n\nIn Issue #45, Donatello wasn't dead as his spirit was in an alternate plane and he was barely clinging to life. Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael carried Donatello's body into the freezer to slow down the bleeding and increase his chance of survival. Fugitoid says he needs to go to Burrow Island to get the equipment to save Donatello. Splinter finds Donatello's spirit and guides his son back to earth, however, due to Donatello wearing a helmet to keep his consciousness alive, his mind is in Metalhead, while his own body is being restored to how it was before his near demise.\n\nIn Issue #46, In Harold's lab, Donatello-as-Metalhead finishes prepping his body to be moved to the lair. He's trying his best to put on a brave face (so to speak), but being trapped in a robot body has been an upsetting experience. The Fugitoid tries to help Donnie adapt to having his mind in a robot body while Harold sees to Metalhead\u2019s repairs (the robot having been trashed by Bebop and Rocksteady). Raphael storms off with Alopex following behind him. Raphael starts regretting leaving Donatello behind and seeing him in a robot body is too much for Raphael to handle, but as soon as Alopex and Leonardo give him some comfort he eventually accepts Donatello as Metalhead and he, Leo and Mikey go on patrol while Donatello and the Fugitoid transfer Donnie's turtle body to the lair of the turtles while Harold gets some equipment to help Donatello get back into his own body.\n\nIn issue #47, He mentioned to Fugitoid and Harold he is connected to his body's vital signs. Indicating he could still feel his body and was slowly getting back to normal. In issue #50, Metalhead self-destructed and Donatello returned to his organic body which has now been outfitted with an artificial shell. Since then he's been fighting alongside his brothers.\n\n== Television==\n* '''The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated television series]]''': Donatello is the genius of the group who invents many of the turtles' vehicles and equipment including the Turtle Van, the Turtle Blimp and the Turtle Com. He\u2019s the calmer turtle out of the 4 turtles. Donatello made many revolutionary inventions, the most notable being the portable portal capable of opening gateways to other dimensions as well as an early warning system which warns of impending attacks from other dimensions or from [[Krang]] and Shredder. In the 1987 series's original Donatello's  voice actor is [[Barry Gordon]] with [[Greg Berg]] as the 1989 alternate voice actor. In the 25th anniversary movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Donatello was voiced by [[Tony Salerno|Anthony Haden Salerno]]. Gordon reprised the role of the 1987 Donatello in two episodes of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 TV series]], \"[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 2)#Episodes|Wormquake!]]\" and \"[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 4)#Episodes|Trans-Dimensional Turtles]]\".<ref>[http://comicbook.com/2016/03/07/eighties-teenage-mutant-mutant-ninja-turtles-to-make-appearance-/ Eighties Teenage Mutant Mutant Ninja Turtles To Make Appearance On Current Animated Series] Comicbook.com, Retrieved May 20, 2017</ref>\n* '''1997 live-action series''' Donatello appeared in the live-action series, ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', as well as the crossover episode of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' portrayed by Richard Yee and voiced by [[Jason Gray-Stanford]].\n* '''2003 animated series''': Donatello \u201cDon\u201d is the brains of the bunch. Like the Mirage comics, Donatello has a mixed personality in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]]. However he\u2019s more pacifistic in this incarnation. Donatello is voiced by [[Sam Riegel]]. His skin color is a medium olive green color; this particular color is only used for him in the 2003 animation.\n\nDonatello is a gifted scientist and mathematician. He does a lot of work with vehicles, technology, and experiments. Any science and math skill you can think of, he will do it all. \n\nDonatello is not as rowdy and violent as his brothers, but he can get a little annoyed with them on occasion. However he never loses his temper. Donatello is calm, sensible, quiet, friendly, and gentle. He doesn\u2019t get into a lot confrontations with his brothers. He is more interested in his work than in his ninjutsu but he still attends to ninja practice and works hard there as well as his projects. \n\nIn the fourth season, during an outbreak of mutations of people and animals in New York, Don got a nasty gash by a monster while fighting several monsters with his brothers. Then in the episode \u201cReturn of Savanti Romero\u201d Don ended up coming down with the sniffles. Later in the episode \"Adventures in Turtlesitting\", he went from a turtle who was home ill with the flu to a monster himself as a result. A similar situation happened with Raphael in the comics.\n\nIn the seventh season, also called \"Back to the Sewer\", Donatello blamed himself for Master Splinter's decompiling and vowed to restore his bits from cyberspace. This obsession caused him to disregard anything else, such as the gang war between the [[Foot Clan]] and the [[Purple Dragons]], as unimportant. It wasn't until seeing his brothers in danger from the Cyber Shredder did he realize he was ignoring his responsibilities to help them and promised not to let his obsession with saving Master Splinter take control again. By the time of ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', the 2003 Donatello is in total disbelief over the scientific aptitude of his 1987 counterpart, in which the alternate Donatello replied, \"Science isn't all about facts you know\", although the two still manage to work together to track their enemies.\n[[File:TMNTDonatello2012.png|thumb|upright|Donatello, as depicted in the 2012 Nickelodeon series.]]\n* '''2012 animated series''': Donatello returns in [[Nickelodeon]]'s [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|new 2012 animated series]], now wielding a b\u014d staff which converts to a [[naginata]] (Japanese halberd). In this version, Donatello has a  crush on [[April O'Neil]] (who is also in teenage years in this adaptation). Despite Donatello being quiet and friendly, he also can lose his temper. Donatello is active and purpose-driven, but at times does not understand and/or has a hard time grasping the lectures of  Master Splinter. His character design was also updated, giving him a gap in his teeth and a taller, leaner appearance than his brothers. Donnie is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] (who was  Raph's original voice actor in the 1987 animated series).<ref>{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/14/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-sean-astin/ |title=Sean Astin in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: He's Raphael &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref>\n* '''[[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''': [[Josh Brener]] voices \"Donatello, an unflappable mechanical genius and tech wizard whose ninja skills are second only to his coding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/rise-of-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-cast-announced/|title=Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cast Announced|date=2 November 2017|publisher=SlashFilm}}</ref> This incarnation of Donatello is more confident, sociable, level-headed, and sarcastic, and wields a high-tech b\u014d staff modified by rocket boosters.\n\n== Movies ==\n\n===Original trilogy (1990-1993)===\nIn the first three live action films, Donatello, like Leonardo, is arguably less mature than he was in the original comics and the 1987 animated series, as he is shown joking around more. The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|first movie]] never officially identifies Donatello as the group's resident \"whiz kid\", though he is occasionally shown tinkering with various devices and is seen to have a vast knowledge of obscure topics (he is shown to be a master at '[[Trivial Pursuit]]' when playing against the other Turtles and later astutely labels Casey Jones a claustrophobic). He takes his time deciding on the most appropriate victory cheers, though his choices are sometimes quite perplexing (for example, \"Bossa Nova!\"). However, the second film clearly established Donatello as the most scientifically-minded turtle as well as the most [[introspection|introspective]], feeling dejected when he learns that the ooze that created the Turtles only exists because of an accident, although Splinter consoles his dejection by pointing out that the circumstances of their origins cannot define their present worth.\n\nThe first film plays up the relationship between him and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]]; in all other versions of the TMNT, Raphael, not Donatello, is closest to Casey, except for the 1987 cartoon, in which Jones does not figure prominently. This is apparently because the scene in which Donatello and Casey bond over the fixing of an old pickup truck was based on a similar scene involving Casey and Raphael in the Mirage comics. [[Corey Feldman]] famously provides Donatello's voice in the first and third live-action films, [[Ernie Reyes Jr.]] does all of the martial arts fight scenes and stunt scenes as Donatello, while Adam Carl filled in for the second movie during Feldman's stint in [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. In the third film, Donatello is the only Turtle who is not tempted to stay in the Feudal Japan of the past, saying that he can't live without technology. The films also portray Donatello as being close with Michelangelo, bantering with him during fight sequences, going off to the side when Leo and Raph are arguing, and in general hanging out in their spare time.\n\n===''TMNT'' (2007)===\nIn the [[TMNT (film)|2007 film]], Donatello runs an IT tech support line to earn money for the family and keeps an eye on Mikey. In the first half of the movie Donatello's skills are more focused on keeping the family together and on income than instead of inventing inventions and finding creative ways to solve problems. It is a combined effort of Leo being gone, Raph unable to control his temper and Donnie's leadership and logically minded skills that add up-to the reason as why he's been put into this position. With the combined efforts of all of these reasons is why Donnie and Raph argue more in this film than in most other depictions of their relationship. Raph is angry that Donnie has been named leader instead of himself while Leo is away and Donnie is angry that Raph hasn't been pulling his weight to support them. To add to this matter is the fact that Raphael was secretly fighting as the Nightwatcher. This disagreement is further explained in the prequel comics by the fact that Donatello does not trust Nightwatcher, because no one knows what side he is really on and because he uses fear to accomplish his ends. Donatello states that Raphael uses many of the same tactics, and hints that he may suspect what his brother really does at night. Donatello also tries to guide Michelangelo away from the idea that vigilantes are heroes. Such action depicts Donatello as a second in command while Leonardo is in [[Central America]], forced to be the responsible one in Leonardo's absence and teach his brothers what Leo would in his place. Don is clearly yet still unofficially established as second in command here, much more than in the other three movies.<ref>{{cite news|title= TMNT: The {{Typo|Rennaissance}} [''sic''] Reptiles Return|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=703|accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> However, Raphael felt he was better suited to be in charge and openly asks Splinter why he was not considered for the role. Splinter explains that Raph has not yet mastered control over his rage and is therefore not eligible to be leader.\n\nIn this film, Donnie also seems to show a bit more emotional care for Mikey than in the previous films. According to the short \"Mikey's Birthday Party\" Donnie helps Mikey with his job as a character entertainer named \"Cowabunga Carl\" by communicating with Mikey via cameras and head gear in order to remind him to hand-out flyers and to get cash (not checks). This seems to irritate Mikey to a large degree. (The 2007 movie never mentions age as a deciding factor). In the [[TMNT (video game)|game tie-in]] his [[IQ]] is \"off the charts\". Don is voiced by [[Mitchell Whitfield]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Raising shell|work= [[USA Today]]|date=2007-03-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-03-20-ninja-turtles-inside_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip|accessdate=2009-12-27 | first=Anthony | last=Breznican}}</ref>\n\n===Reboot (2014)===\nDonatello appears in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' portrayed by [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]. In this film, Donatello  the brains of the team and relies heavily on high-tech equipment and gear. His personality in this film is very calm and measured, and was also given a much more [[nerd]]y portrayal than in previous adaptations, on account of his large glasses with the middle taped. He also has a similar personality to his 1987 and 2003 counterparts where he is always talking of calculations and constantly confusing his brothers with them. He is also the one who stopped the toxic poison that Shredder had activated on Sacks Tower. Like Michelangelo and Leonardo, Donatello wears a glove on his left hand, has a tech pack on his shell and boots although you can partly see his toes making only him, Raphael and Michelangelo the only turtles to stay true to their other incarnations with the two toes. Donatello appears in the sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''.\n\n===DC crossover film===\nDonatello appears in the direct-to-video crossover film ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', voiced by [[Baron Vaughn]].<ref>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-batman-and-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-meet-in-first-animated-movie</ref>\n\n==Video games==\nIn the video games based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 series)|1987 animated series]], Donatello has the longest range, although he cannot inflict as much damage as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], who has the second-longest range; one notable exception is [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|the first NES game]], where Donatello both did the most damage and had the longest range, though his attacks were slow. This has been carried over into the games inspired by the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 series)|2003 animated series]]. In ''[[TMNT: Smash Up]]'', he is voiced by [[Sam Riegel]].\n\nDonatello is one of the main playable characters in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'', where he is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. Donatello also appears in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 video game)|2014 film-based game]], voiced by [[Oliver Vaquer]].\n\nDonatello will be featured as one of the playable characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as DLC in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Joe Brogie]]. While Leonardo is the default turtle outside the gear loadout, he, Michelangelo and Raphael can only be picked through the said loadout selection similar to the premier skin characters.\n\n<br />\n\n==== External links and information ====\n[http://ninjaturtle.com See more information at official website Ninja Turtles]\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Animal superheroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic martial artists]]\n[[Category:Child superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics articles that need to differentiate between fact and fiction]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional bojutsuka]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional comedians]]\n[[Category:Fictional electronic engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional geneticists]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional kobud\u014dka]]\n[[Category:Fictional machinists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mutants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional roboticists]]\n[[Category:Fictional stick-fighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional turtles]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Injustice (franchise) guest characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters]]\n[[Category:Tony Hawk's (series) guest characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2011}}\n{{italic dab}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProjectComics-->\n|image=Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).jpg\n|species=Mutant turtle\n|imagesize=500\n|caption= Textless cover of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Micro-Series'' #3 (February 2012).<br>Art by [[David Petersen (comics)|David Petersen]].\n|character_name= Donatello\n|publisher= [[Mirage Studios]] <small>(1984\u20131995, 2001\u20132010)</small><ref>{{cite news|title= Heroes in a Half Shell Turn the Big 2\u20135 |work= The New York Times|date=April 20, 2009|url= http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/heroes-n-a-half-shell-turn-the-big-2-5/?scp=4&sq=ninja%20turtles%20reviews&st=cse|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}</ref><br>[[Image Comics]] <small>(1996\u20131999)</small><br>[[IDW Publishing]] <small>(2011\u2013present)</small>\n|debut= ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' #1 (May 1984)\n|creators= [[Kevin Eastman]]<br>[[Peter Laird]]\n|powers= Mastery of [[ninjutsu]], [[Naginata]] and [[B\u014d]], [[Okinawan kobud\u014d|kobud\u014d]], and [[Qigong|Chi Gong]], and stealth<br />Olympic-level agility, speed, and strength And also is the best<br />[[Genius]]-level intellect<br/> Scientist, engineer and inventor\n}}\n\n'''Donatello''', nickname  '''Don''' or '''Donnie''', is a fictional superhero and one of the four main characters of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] comics and all related media.<ref>{{cite news|title= Show Business: Lean, Green and on the Screen\n|work= Time|date=1990-04-02|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969727-2,00.html#ixzz0h91fnBrj\n|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Janice C. | last=Simpson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Just How Powerful Are Those Turtles?|work= The New York Times|date=1990-04-15|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/movies/just-how-powerful-are-those-turtles.html?scp=8&sq=ninja%20turtles&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-07 | first1=Harvey R. | last1=Greenberg}}</ref> He is co-creator [[Peter Laird]]'s favorite Turtle.\n \nHe is usually depicted wearing a [[purple (color)|purple]] eye mask.

While the comics portrayal of the team has no official command structure, in the early stories he is depicted as second-in-command. In the first issue, he is the one that killed the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] by knocking him and his grenade off the roof.  The second issue elaborated more on each turtles' personalities and opened with Donatello soldering a circuit. Later in the issue, Donatello states that he is \"familiar with some computer systems\" and helps [[April O'Neil]] deactivate the Mousers. During the turtles' exile to Northampton, Donatello becomes obsessed with fixing up and repairing the many broken things within the farmhouse they were living in. Most notably he spent days and nights fixing the boiler to give his family hot running water and builds a windmill and a water wheel to provide electricity. He also finds an old typewriter and writes his own personal credo.\n\nIn the ''Donatello'' [[One shot (comics)|one shot]], Donatello encounters an artist called Kirby (an homage to the comic artist [[Jack Kirby]]) whose mysterious crystal brings his drawings to life before disappearing. The two newfound friends journey to a dimension inhabited by Kirby's creations and help the heroes defeat the invading monsters.\n\nIn the ''Shades of Grey'' storyline, [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] encounters the turtle by a ravine as he was pondering \"the fractal structure of natural patterns\". Casey accuses the turtle of using big words and acting better than everyone else. Donatello suggests they should continue the conversation when Casey is sober. Grabbing a stick, an angry Jones continually pokes the turtle until he loses his temper and sends Casey careening into the water.\n\nIn the ''City at War'' storyline, the turtles return to New York to put an end to the Foot Clan's civil war. During a battle with Shredder's Elite Guards in the ruins of the Second Time Around Shop, Donatello falls through the floor and breaks his leg. Seeing their ally [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] subdued and about to be killed, Donatello grabs one of the Foot's machine guns and repeatedly shoots the Foot Elite. Donatello is visibly shaken by the violence and throws the gun away. At the end of the story the turtles, April and Casey move back to New York save for Donatello who chooses to stay in Northampton with [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Master Splinter]] to heal from his injury as well as reflect on everything that had happened. While meditating with Splinter, Donatello receives a vision of the future where he is in the village of Chihaya in Japan. When Donatello asks what he would be doing there, his master simply replies \"To bury me\". After encountering the turtle vigilante ally Nobody in civilian guise he returns with him to New York to help his brothers battle [[Baxter Stockman]].\n\nIn the current comics, Donatello finds an armored truck in the sewers which apparently had been part of a bank robbery in the sixties. Along with [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and Casey Jones, he undertakes the task of fixing up the vehicle. After the death of Splinter, Donatello secretly goes to his body and asks forgiveness before clipping something off him. Shortly after, Donatello decides to accompany the Utroms on a mission to [[Tepui]] to search for two missing research teams. The group are attacked by strange wooden creatures who shrink them to miniature size. The creatures turn out to be a group of Utroms which had been stranded in the Jungle during their first stay on Earth and had been living in secret thanks to their Quantum Inversion Redimensioning device which could alter their size. The process could not be reversed on Donatello, possibly due to his mutation, leaving him the size of an action figure. While the Utroms work on returning him to normal, Donatello put his new size to use infiltrating a terrorist organizations warehouse. He's also made a robotic body for him made to resemble a turtle to help him move around.\n\nThis incarnation of Donatello appeared in the ''[[Turtles Forever]]'' crossover special voiced by Christopher C. Adams.\n\n===Image Comics===\nIn the [[Image Comics]] incarnation of the [http://ninjaturtle.com TMNT], he became a [[cyborg]] after his body was partially destroyed after he was shot and dropped out of a [[helicopter]] (he maintained a positive attitude nonetheless, although he was constantly at risk of losing his mind to the cyborg half). He was supposedly killed by Image character Deathwatch by having his brain drained of mutagen. [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] blamed the cpu of Don's armor for his death; however, Donatello wasn't dead but was separated from his body, and with the help of his brothers he returned to his body.

After a brief fight, Rocksteady smashed Donatello's shell, nearly killing him.\n\nThe news of his supposed death spread all over the web and IGN did an interview with Tom Waltz, the script writer and he called the final scene a beautiful rendered scene, catching the emotion of the family.

Splinter finds Donatello's spirit and guides his son back to earth, however, due to Donatello wearing a helmet to keep his consciousness alive, his mind is in Metalhead, while his own body is being restored to how it was before his near demise.\n\nIn Issue #46, In Harold's lab, Donatello-as-Metalhead finishes prepping his body to be moved to the lair. He's trying his best to put on a brave face (so to speak), but being trapped in a robot body has been an upsetting experience. The Fugitoid tries to help Donnie adapt to having his mind in a robot body while Harold sees to Metalhead\u2019s repairs (the robot having been trashed by Bebop and Rocksteady). Raphael storms off with Alopex following behind him. Raphael starts regretting leaving Donatello behind and seeing him in a robot body is too much for Raphael to handle, but as soon as Alopex and Leonardo give him some comfort he eventually accepts Donatello as Metalhead and he, Leo and Mikey go on patrol while Donatello and the Fugitoid transfer Donnie's turtle body to the lair of the turtles while Harold gets some equipment to help Donatello get back into his own body.\n\nIn issue #47, He mentioned to Fugitoid and Harold he is connected to his body's vital signs. Indicating he could still feel his body and was slowly getting back to normal. In issue #50, Metalhead self-destructed and Donatello returned to his organic body which has now been outfitted with an artificial shell. Since then he's been fighting alongside his brothers.\n\n== Television==\n* '''The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated television series]]''': Donatello is the genius of the group who invents many of the turtles' vehicles and equipment including the Turtle Van, the Turtle Blimp and the Turtle Com. He\u2019s the calmer turtle out of the 4 turtles. Donatello made many revolutionary inventions, the most notable being the portable portal capable of opening gateways to other dimensions as well as an early warning system which warns of impending attacks from other dimensions or from [[Krang]] and Shredder. In the 1987 series's original Donatello's  voice actor is [[Barry Gordon]] with [[Greg Berg]] as the 1989 alternate voice actor. In the 25th anniversary movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Donatello was voiced by [[Tony Salerno|Anthony Haden Salerno]]. Gordon reprised the role of the 1987 Donatello in two episodes of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 TV series]], \"[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 2)#Episodes|Wormquake!]]\" and \"[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 4)#Episodes|Trans-Dimensional Turtles]]\".<ref>[http://comicbook.com/2016/03/07/eighties-teenage-mutant-mutant-ninja-turtles-to-make-appearance-/ Eighties Teenage Mutant Mutant Ninja Turtles To Make Appearance On Current Animated Series] Comicbook.com, Retrieved May 20, 2017</ref>\n* '''1997 live-action series''' Donatello appeared in the live-action series, ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', as well as the crossover episode of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' portrayed by Richard Yee and voiced by [[Jason Gray-Stanford]].\n* '''2003 animated series''': Donatello \u201cDon\u201d is the brains of the bunch. Like the Mirage comics, Donatello has a mixed personality in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]]. However he\u2019s more pacifistic in this incarnation. Donatello is voiced by [[Sam Riegel]]. His skin color is a medium olive green color; this particular color is only used for him in the 2003 animation.\n\nDonatello is a gifted scientist and mathematician. He does a lot work with vehicles, technology, and experiments. Any science and math skill you can think of, he will do it all. \n\nDonatello is not as rowdy and violent as his brothers, but he can get a little annoyed with them on occasion. However he never loses his temper. Donatello is calm, sensible, quiet, friendly, and gentle. He doesn\u2019t get into a lot confrontations with his brothers. He is more interested in his work than in his ninjutsu but he still attends to ninja practice and works hard there as well as his projects. \n\nIn the fourth season, during an outbreak of mutations of people and animals in New York, Don got a nasty gash by a monster while fighting several monsters with his brothers. Then in the episode \u201cReturn of Savanti Romero\u201d Don ended up coming down with the sniffles. Later in the episode \"Adventures in Turtlesitting\", he went from a turtle who was home ill with the flu to a monster himself as a result. A similar situation happened with Raphael in the comics.\n\nIn the seventh season, also called \"Back to the Sewer\", Donatello blamed himself for Master Splinter's decompiling and vowed to restore his bits from cyberspace. This obsession caused him to disregard anything else, such as the gang war between the [[Foot Clan]] and the [[Purple Dragons]], as unimportant. It wasn't until seeing his brothers in danger from the Cyber Shredder did he realize he was ignoring his responsibilities to help them and promised not to let his obsession with saving Master Splinter take control again. By the time of ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', the 2003 Donatello is in total disbelief over the scientific aptitude of his 1987 counterpart, in which the alternate Donatello replied, \"Science isn't all about facts you know\", although the two still manage to work together to track their enemies.\n[[File:TMNTDonatello2012.png|thumb|upright|Donatello, as depicted in the 2012 Nickelodeon series.]]\n* '''2012 animated series''': Donatello returns in [[Nickelodeon]]'s [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|new 2012 animated series]], now wielding a b\u014d staff which converts to a [[naginata]] (Japanese halberd). In this version, Donatello has a  crush on [[April O'Neil]] (who is also in teenage years in this adaptation). Despite Donatello being quiet and friendly, he also can lose his temper. Donatello is active and purpose-driven, but at times does not understand and/or has a hard time grasping the lectures of  Master Splinter. His character design was also updated, giving him a gap in his teeth and a taller, leaner appearance than his brothers. Donnie is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]] (who was  Raph's original voice actor in the 1987 animated series).<ref>{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/14/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-sean-astin/ |title=Sean Astin in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: He's Raphael &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref>\n* '''[[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''': [[Josh Brener]] voices \"Donatello, an unflappable mechanical genius and tech wizard whose ninja skills are second only to his coding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/rise-of-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-cast-announced/|title=Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cast Announced|date=2 November 2017|publisher=SlashFilm}}</ref> This incarnation of Donatello is more confident, sociable, level-headed, and sarcastic, and wields a high-tech b\u014d staff modified by rocket boosters.\n\n== Movies ==\n\n===Original trilogy (1990-1993)===\nIn the first three live action films, Donatello, like Leonardo, is arguably less mature than he was in the original comics and the 1987 animated series, as he is shown joking around more. The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|first movie]] never officially identifies Donatello as the group's resident \"whiz kid\", though he is occasionally shown tinkering with various devices and is seen to have a vast knowledge of obscure topics (he is shown to be a master at '[[Trivial Pursuit]]' when playing against the other Turtles and later astutely labels Casey Jones a claustrophobic). He takes his time deciding on the most appropriate victory cheers, though his choices are sometimes quite perplexing (for example, \"Bossa Nova!\"). However, the second film clearly established Donatello as the most scientifically-minded turtle as well as the most [[introspection|introspective]], feeling dejected when he learns that the ooze that created the Turtles only exists because of an accident, although Splinter consoles his dejection by pointing out that the circumstances of their origins cannot define their present worth.\n\nThe first film plays up the relationship between him and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]]; in all other versions of the TMNT, Raphael, not Donatello, is closest to Casey, except for the 1987 cartoon, in which Jones does not figure prominently. This is apparently because the scene in which Donatello and Casey bond over the fixing of an old pickup truck was based on a similar scene involving Casey and Raphael in the Mirage comics. [[Corey Feldman]] famously provides Donatello's voice in the first and third live-action films, [[Ernie Reyes Jr.]] does all of the martial arts fight scenes and stunt scenes as Donatello, while Adam Carl filled in for the second movie during Feldman's stint in [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. In the third film, Donatello is the only Turtle who is not tempted to stay in the Feudal Japan of the past, saying that he can't live without technology. The films also portray Donatello as being close with Michelangelo, bantering with him during fight sequences, going off to the side when Leo and Raph are arguing, and in general hanging out in their spare time.\n\n===''TMNT'' (2007)===\nIn the [[TMNT (film)|2007 film]], Donatello runs an IT tech support line to earn money for the family and keeps an eye on Mikey. In the first half of the movie Donatello's skills are more focused on keeping the family together and on income than instead of inventing inventions and finding creative ways to solve problems. It is a combined effort of Leo being gone, Raph unable to control his temper and Donnie's leadership and logically minded skills that add up-to the reason as why he's been put into this position. With the combined efforts of all of these reasons is why Donnie and Raph argue more in this film than in most other depictions of their relationship. Raph is angry that Donnie has been named leader instead of himself while Leo is away and Donnie is angry that Raph hasn't been pulling his weight to support them. To add to this matter is the fact that Raphael was secretly fighting as the Nightwatcher. This disagreement is further explained in the prequel comics by the fact that Donatello does not trust Nightwatcher, because no one knows what side he is really on and because he uses fear to accomplish his ends. Donatello states that Raphael uses many of the same tactics, and hints that he may suspect what his brother really does at night. Donatello also tries to guide Michelangelo away from the idea that vigilantes are heroes. Such action depicts Donatello as a second in command while Leonardo is in [[Central America]], forced to be the responsible one in Leonardo's absence and teach his brothers what Leo would in his place. Don is clearly yet still unofficially established as second in command here, much more than in the other three movies.<ref>{{cite news|title= TMNT: The {{Typo|Rennaissance}} [''sic''] Reptiles Return|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=703|accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> However, Raphael felt he was better suited to be in charge and openly asks Splinter why he was not considered for the role. Splinter explains that Raph has not yet mastered control over his rage and is therefore not eligible to be leader.\n\nIn this film, Donnie also seems to show a bit more emotional care for Mikey than in the previous films. According to the short \"Mikey's Birthday Party\" Donnie helps Mikey with his job as a character entertainer named \"Cowabunga Carl\" by communicating with Mikey via cameras and head gear in order to remind him to hand-out flyers and to get cash (not checks). This seems to irritate Mikey to a large degree. (The 2007 movie never mentions age as a deciding factor). In the [[TMNT (video game)|game tie-in]] his [[IQ]] is \"off the charts\". Don is voiced by [[Mitchell Whitfield]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Raising shell|work= [[USA Today]]|date=2007-03-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-03-20-ninja-turtles-inside_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip|accessdate=2009-12-27 | first=Anthony | last=Breznican}}</ref>\n\n===Reboot (2014)===\nDonatello appears in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' portrayed by [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]. In this film, Donatello  the brains of the team and relies heavily on high-tech equipment and gear. His personality in this film is very calm and measured, and was also given a much more [[nerd]]y portrayal than in previous adaptations, on account of his large glasses with the middle taped. He also has a similar personality to his 1987 and 2003 counterparts where he is always talking of calculations and constantly confusing his brothers with them. He is also the one who stopped the toxic poison that Shredder had activated on Sacks Tower. Like Michelangelo and Leonardo, Donatello wears a glove on his left hand, has a tech pack on his shell and boots although you can partly see his toes making only him, Raphael and Michelangelo the only turtles to stay true to their other incarnations with the two toes. Donatello appears in the sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''.\n\n===DC crossover film===\nDonatello appears in the direct-to-video crossover film ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', voiced by [[Baron Vaughn]].<ref>https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/exclusive-batman-and-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-meet-in-first-animated-movie</ref>\n\n==Video games==\nIn the video games based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 series)|1987 animated series]], Donatello has the longest range, although he cannot inflict as much damage as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], who has the second-longest range; one notable exception is [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|the first NES game]], where Donatello both did the most damage and had the longest range, though his attacks were slow. This has been carried over into the games inspired by the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 series)|2003 animated series]]. In ''[[TMNT: Smash Up]]'', he is voiced by [[Sam Riegel]].\n\nDonatello is one of the main playable characters in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'', where he is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. Donatello also appears in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 video game)|2014 film-based game]], voiced by [[Oliver Vaquer]].\n\nDonatello will be featured as one of the playable characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as DLC in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Joe Brogie]]. While Leonardo is the default turtle outside the gear loadout, he, Michelangelo and Raphael can only be picked through the said loadout selection similar to the premier skin characters.\n\n<br />\n\n==== External links and information ====\n[http://ninjaturtle.com See more information at official website Ninja Turtles]\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Animal superheroes]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic martial artists]]\n[[Category:Child superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics articles that need to differentiate between fact and fiction]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional bojutsuka]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional comedians]]\n[[Category:Fictional electronic engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional geneticists]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional humanoids]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional kobud\u014dka]]\n[[Category:Fictional machinists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mutants]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional roboticists]]\n[[Category:Fictional stick-fighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional turtles]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Injustice (franchise) guest characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters]]\n[[Category:Tony Hawk's (series) guest characters]]\n", "name_user": "MrHumanPersonGuy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTelevision:\"he does a lot work with vehicles\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)"}
