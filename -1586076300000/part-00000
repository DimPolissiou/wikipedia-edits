Its largest city, [[Bordeaux]], together with its suburbs and satellite cities, forms the 7th-largest metropolitan area of France, with 850,000 inhabitants. The region has 25 major urban areas, among which the most important after Bordeaux are [[Bayonne]] (288,000 inhabitants), [[Limoges]] (283,000), [[Poitiers]] (255,000), [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] (241,000), and [[La Rochelle]] (206,000), as well as 11 major clusters. The growth of its population, particularly marked on the coast, makes this one of the most attractive areas economically in France; the new region outperforms the [[\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]] in demographic dynamism.\n\nAfter \u00cele-de-France, New Aquitaine is the premier French region in research and innovation, with five universities ([[University of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[University of La Rochelle|La Rochelle]], [[University of Limoges|Limoges]], [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]] and [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour|Pau]]) and several [[Grandes \u00e9coles|Grandes Ecoles]]. The agricultural region of Europe with the greatest turnover, it is the French region with the most tourism jobs, as it has three of the four historic resorts on the French Atlantic coast: ([[Arcachon]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Royan]]), as well as several ski resorts (e.g. [[Gourette]]), and is the fifth French region for business creation (all sectors).\n\nIts economy is based on [[agriculture]] and [[viticulture]] ([[Bordeaux wine|vineyards of Bordeaux]] and [[Cognac]]), [[tourism]], a powerful [[aerospace industry]], [[digital economy]] and design, parachemical and pharmaceutical industries, [[financial sector]] ([[Niort]] is the fourth-largest financial center in the nation, specialising in mutual insurance companies), and industrial ceramics ([[Limoges]]).\n\nThe new region includes major parts of [[Southern France]] (\"Midi de la France\"), marked by [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Langues d'o\u00efl|O\u00efl]] ([[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]] and [[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) cultures.

Taking into consideration the urban area, the new region is home to six of the fifty largest metropolitan areas of French territory (population 2011):\n\n* Bordeaux (1,140,668 inhabitants)\n* [[Bayonne]] (283,571)\n* [[Limoges]] (282,876)\n* [[Poitiers]] (254 051)\n* [[Arrondissement of Pau|Pau]] (240,898)\n* [[La Rochelle]] (205,822).\n\nIn addition, the region has a network of medium towns scattered throughout its territory, including:\n\n* [[Angoul\u00eame]] (108,304)\n* [[Agen]] (79,764)\n* [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]] (75,925)\n* [[Niort]] (71,046)\n* [[P\u00e9rigueux]] (66,423)\n* [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (64,427)\n* [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot]] (49,354)\n* [[Arrondissement of Dax|Dax]] (48,820)\n* [[Mont-de-Marsan]] (40,269)\n\n=== Geographical features ===\n\nThe region covers a large part of the [[Aquitaine Basin]] and a small portion of the [[Paris Basin]] (the border between the two being located at the \"[[Seuil du Poitou]]\") and the Limousin plate (part of the Massif Central) and the western part of the [[Pyrenees]]. It is part of five watersheds facing the Atlantic Ocean: [[Loire]], [[Charente (river)|Charente]], [[Garonne]] and [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]] (and their extension, the [[Gironde estuary]]) and [[Adour]], giving rivers bordering land dedicated mostly to viticulture and to agriculture.\n\n[[File:Dune du Pyla-08.jpg|thumb|left|The [[dune of Pilat]] is the tallest sand dune in Europe.]]\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine also relies on the presence of a large open coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], from the National Nature Reserve Aiguillon Bay and the estuary of the [[S\u00e8vre Niortaise|S\u00e8vre]] (north [[Charron, Charente-Maritime|Charron]]) than [[Bidasoa]] (south of [[Hendaye]]) and including the islands of the Charentais Archipelago (islands of [[\u00cele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]], [[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]], [[\u00cele d'Aix|Aix]] and [[\u00eele Madame|Madame]]) and the wide notch from Arcachon. This diverse area is the area of the oyster (Marennes-Ol\u00e9ron and the Bassin d\u2019Arcachon), mussel (mussels from Baie de l\u2019Aiguillon), and Tourism, evidenced by the presence of famous resorts such [[Arcachon]] (C\u00f4te d\u2019Argent), [[Biarritz]] (C\u00f4te Basque) and [[Royan]] (C\u00f4te de Beaut\u00e9).\n\nFrom the {{Interlanguage link multi|Arvert peninsula|fr|3=Presqu'\u00eele d'Arvert}} to the coast of [[Labourd]], the coastline, almost straight, is lined with high dunes, rising to the [[Dune du Pilat]], large lakes ([[Lac d'Hourtin-Carcans]], [[\u00e9tang de Lacanau]], [[\u00e9tang de Cazaux et de Sanguinet]] , [[lac de Biscarrosse et de Parentis]]...) and wetlands (r\u00e9serve naturelle nationale des dunes et marais d'Hourtin) above vast pine forests planted in the nineteenth century. The [[Landes forest]], by far the most extensive, covering almost one million hectares (nearly 950,000 of maritimes pins), making it the largest artificial forest of Western Europe. Forming a vast triangle starting from the [[Pointe de Grave]], north of [[Soulac-sur-Mer]] to [[Soorts-Hossegor|Hossegor]] in the south and east [[N\u00e9rac]], it replaced the thankless, sandy and marshy moorland that characterised the region for centuries. The Landes forest is partially included in the [[Landes de Gascogne Regional Natural Park]], which begins south of [[Bordeaux]].\n\nFurther north, in the wake of the Landes forest, on the right bank of the [[Gironde estuary]], the [[forest of la Coubre]] presents the same characteristics, forming the main \"green lung\" of [[Royan]] on nearly 8000 hectares. Other important forests cover the region: in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], the [[Irati Forest]] covers over 17,000 hectares; at the borders of the Charente, Charente-Maritime and Dordogne, the forest of the Double, punctuated by nearly 500 lakes, spans about 50,000 hectares; further north, near [[Poitiers]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Mouli\u00e8re forest|fr|3=For\u00eat de Mouli\u00e8re}} stretches nearly 6,800 hectares. Further east, close to [[Gu\u00e9ret]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chabri\u00e8res forest|fr|3=For\u00eat de Chabri\u00e8res}} reaches 2000 hectares.\n\n[[File:Ossau face est01.jpg|thumb|The [[pic du Midi d'Ossau]].]]\n\nThe extreme southern region has a mountainous character with the presence of the [[Pyrenees]]. If its western part (mountains of Labourd) is made more high green hills generally struggling to reach 1000 meters ([[Larrun|La Rhune]], near [[Bayonne]], is 905 meters high, but further east, the culmination of [[French Basque Country]], the [[pic d'Orhy]], nevertheless amounts to 2017 m), the [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] region is marked by more mineral landscapes, and is surrounded by high peaks often exceeding 2000 meters. The highlight of the region, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic Palas|simple}} (2974 m) is located not far away. Other Pyrenean peaks located in the region are also spectacular [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]] (2884 meters), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Arriel|fr}} (2824 m), the [[Pic de Ger]] (2613 m) near the Winter resort [[Gourette]], [[Pic d'Anie]] (2504 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Latte de Bazen|fr}} (2472 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Ansab\u00e8re|eu|3=Ansab\u00e8re}} (2377 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic de l'Arraille|fr}} (2147 m) or the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Arlas|ru|3=\u0410\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0441}} (2044 m).\n\nThis hilly region is traversed many mountain streams, called [[Gave (placename element)|gaves]]: among these include the [[Gave de Pau]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gave de Bious|fr}} the [[Gave d'Ossau]] or the [[Gaves r\u00e9unis]], on the border of Landes and Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques. [[Ossau Valley]], one of the three valleys of [[B\u00e9arn]], extends from the suburbs of Pau to [[Col du Pourtalet]] to the Spanish border. Glacial lakes, its fauna and flora exceptional explain its integration into the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]].\n\nBelonging to the [[Massif Central]], [[Limousin]] also has a marked relief, with its high [[plateau]]x and some hedgerow eroded peaks that dominate green valleys and forests of oak and chestnut trees. Limousin plateau, cut by the valleys of the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne]] (who waters his capital, [[Limoges]]) [[Isle (river)|Isle]], [[V\u00e9z\u00e8re]] or the picturesque [[Corr\u00e8ze (river)|Corr\u00e8ze]], with its cashed reliefs, hardly exceeds 500 meters. It marks the watershed line between the [[Loire]] basin to the north (the sources of the [[Briance]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Aixette|de}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gr\u00eane|de}} or the [[Gorre]]), the basin south of the Dordogne (sources of [[Dronne]], of Isle and of [[Auv\u00e9z\u00e8re]]) and maritime watershed of the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], in the west.\n\n[[File:S\u00e9di\u00e8res 1 110.jpg|thumb|left|Typical landscape in [[Corr\u00e8ze]].]]\n\nThe mountains of Limousin, which include a series of small mountains (mont Fayat, Monedi\u00e8res Hills, mont de Ch\u00e2lus) peak at Mont Bessou (976 m), in Corr\u00e8ze. Further north, the mountains of Marche, which are divided into mountains of monts de Gu\u00e9ret, mont d'Ambazac and monts de Blond, are more like high wooded hills dotted with pastures, as real peaks. They culminate in Signal de Sauvagnac (701 m), in Haute-Vienne. Southwest of Limousin and P\u00e9rigord northwest since 1998 are integrated to the [[Parc naturel r\u00e9gional P\u00e9rigord Limousin]].\n\nThe northern part of the region, which corresponds to the Haut-Poitou history, is organised around a tray agricultural and viticultural (vineyard of Haut-Poitou) irrigated by the [[Vienne]], [[Clain]] or the [[Gartempe]], which form so little valleys, often lined with oak forests. Further south, the Niortais this open landscapes (openfields) in grain dominant, but also rich wetland areas such as the [[Marais Poitevin]], a legacy of an old marine gulf filled with alluvium, which is divided into wet marshes (we speaks more readily of \"Green Venice\") and marshes dried up, converted into mixed farming. [[Niort]], on the [[S\u00e8vre Niortaise]], main town of the Haut-Poitou outside [[Poitiers]], is like a door of this \"Green Venice\" much of which belongs to the [[Marais Poitevin|parc naturel r\u00e9gional du Marais poitevin]], established in 1979, classified \"Grand site de France\".\n\nFurther south lie the Charentes, which correspond to the former provinces of [[Aunis]], [[Angoumois]] and [[Saintonge]]. Aunis is not unlike the landscape of Niortais, with large marshes that extend from either side of [[La Rochelle]] and [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] (Baie d'Yves, marais de Rochefort, Broue and [[Brouage]]) but also the islands of [[\u00cele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]] and [[\u00cele d'Aix|Aix]], with varied landscapes where pine forests mingle, sandy beaches or the curious lagoon of Fier d'Ars, the sands in constant motion, which houses a bird sanctuary. The interior of the territory is marked by the presence of a rich plain cereal evoking the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] by its open relief on the horizon. At the center of this space, the city of [[Surg\u00e8res]] remained a pastureland where dairy farming has retained its importance: the small city is thus a production centers butter, Beurre de Charentes-Poitou.\n\n[[File:Le Vanneau-Passerelle.jpg|thumb|Between [[Poitou]] and [[Charente-Maritime]], the [[Marais Poitevin]].]]\n\nThe [[Angoumois]] forms a transitional space between the coastal plains of Aunis, large \"champagne\" of Saintonge and Limousin plateau. Dotted with small hills, he seems to live to the rhythm of the Charente, real artery watering its major cities, [[Angoul\u00eame]], [[Cognac, France|Cognac]] and [[Jarnac]]. Great wine region, internationally renowned alcohol is produced there, [[cognac]], and a water spirits called [[Pineau des Charentes]]. The western quarter of Charentes consists of Saintonge, organised territory around the towns of [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], the first capital of Aquitaine in Roman times, and [[Royan]].\n\nIn continuation of the Angoumois, the Dordogne approximately corresponds to the former province of [[P\u00e9rigord]]. Taking its name from the river of the same name, which flows [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] but not its prefecture, [[P\u00e9rigueux]] (the edge of the [[Isle (river)|Isle]]), the area with varied landscapes has a large afforestation rate (45%) making it the third most wooded department France. The great forests of oak and chestnut trees of green P\u00e9rigord, organised around [[Nontron]], meet the great grain fields of the White P\u00e9rigord, nicknamed \"the breadbasket of the P\u00e9rigord\", the oak, walnut and black P\u00e9rigord truffle, around [[Sarlat-la-Caneda]] and vineyards of Bergerac or purple P\u00e9rigord, which produces Bergerac, monbazillac or p\u00e9charmant.\n\n[[File:Roseli\u00e8re de Pauillac et carrelets sur l'estuaire de la Gironde, France.jpg|thumb|The [[Gironde estuary]] is the largest estuary in western Europe.]]\n\nThe [[Gironde estuary]], which acts as a link between [[Saintonge]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Blayais|oc|3=Blai\u00e9s}}, [[M\u00e9doc]] and western [[Guyenne]], is in itself a world apart. Wild largest estuary in Europe, being classified in the marine park with the \"Pertuis charentais\", it is lined with large marshes (\"Petite Camargue\" and hillsides which produces most of the great Bordeaux wines from the C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux and C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg on the right bank to the great wines of the left bank M\u00e9doc (Pauillac, Margaux, Saint-Est\u00e8phe, Saint-Julien. The vineyards of Bordeaux, with international reputation, has done for centuries the reputation of the region. His productions are exported worldwide.\n\nFarther south lies the vast plain Landes (south of Gironde and Landes), which begins near Bordeaux and go to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. Largely occupied by the [[Landes forest]], it is also a major agricultural area (maize farming) and hosts a spa of international reputation, Dax, also the capital of [[Chalosse]], important breeding ground.\n\n[[File:Bassin d'Arcachon - Cabanes tchanqu\u00e9es.jpg|thumb|\"Cabanes tchanqu\u00e9es\" in the [[bassin d'Arcachon]].]]\n\nThe coastline subject to severe erosion, remained very wild. Some resorts have been built in the dunes from [[Soulac-sur-Mer]] in the north of the Gironde, via [[Lacanau]], [[Hourtin]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]] and [[Capbreton]], without forgetting those bordering the Bay of Arcachon: [[Arcachon]], [[Andernos-les-Bains]], [[L\u00e8ge-Cap-Ferret]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pyla-sur-Mer|es}}. This vast lagoon, wide open ocean, houses since 2014 the marine natural park of Arcachon basin.\n\nEastern Guyenne corresponds in part to the department of [[Lot-et-Garonne]]. Rich agricultural and farming area watered by both the [[Lot (river)|Lot]] and the [[Garonne]], it is famous for its \"[[prune]]aux\", who took the name of its capital, [[Agen]] (nearly 8000 hectares of land are dedicated to Ente plum orchards) while [[Marmande]] is famous for its tomatoes. The mild climate explains that also cultivated [[tobacco]], as well as strawberries (\"gariguettes\") and vines, used to produce the C\u00f4tes du marmandais the buzet or C\u00f4te de Brulhois, that relate to the broad vineyard of the Southwest. But the real glory of this land is [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], a famous brandy, exported around the world. Its vineyards cover some of the departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Landes but also the [[Gers]] (in the neighbouring region of [[Occitanie]]). It also produces the [[floc de Gascogne]], with delicate floral accents.\n\nThe extreme south of the region consists of two territories in strong identity, the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] (Northern Basque Country or \"Iparralde\") and [[B\u00e9arn]]. The first, which is organised around [[Bayonne]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] (Labourd) [[Maul\u00e9on-Licharre]] (Soule) and [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] (Lower Navarre) has its warm and humid climate its green side, the Atlantic rains from butter against the Pyrenean barrier. The coast, with its posh resorts or family, makes it a popular holiday resort. The interior, more rural, retains a strong agricultural tradition and a solid wine region, symbolised by the vineyard iroul\u00e9guy but also by traditional liquors such as [[Izarra (liqueur)|izarra]] and [[patxaran]], eau-de-vie characteristic of [[Navarre]] .\n\nAnchored in the heart of the Pyrenees, the B\u00e9arn opposes his Gascon traditions. Has a succession of gently accented hills and valleys (that of Pau river, which concentrates the capital, [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], and several cited as [[Orthez]] and [[Navarrenx]], being the most populated), it comprises the [[Aspe Valley|Aspe]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Bar\u00e9tous Valley|fr|3=Vall\u00e9e de Bar\u00e9tous|lt=Bar\u00e9tous}} and [[Ossau Valley|Ossau]] valleys with the [[Col du Soulor]]. Agriculture will always prominently, as viticulture (juran\u00e7on, Madiran) even if the aeronautical and petrochemical sectors are also represented. It was in B\u00e9arn that are concentrated the main ski resorts in the area, such {{Interlanguage link multi|Artouste|fr}}, [[Gourette]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Issarbe|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|La Pierre Saint-Martin|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Le Somport|fr}}.\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Dune \u00e0 Boyardville.JPG|Sands dune in [[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]] ([[Charente-Maritime]])\nFile:Baretous piemont Pyreneen.jpg|The {{Interlanguage link multi|Bar\u00e9tous Valley|fr|3=Vall\u00e9e de Bar\u00e9tous}} ([[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]])\nFile:Castelnaud-la-Chapelle 2 Stevage.jpg|Medieval city of [[Castelnaud-la-Chapelle]] ([[Dordogne]])\nFile:BordLac.jpg|The main lake of [[Biscarrosse]] (Landes)\nFile:2009 Aubusson Creuse France 3820681551.jpg|Old town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] ([[Creuse]])\n</gallery>\n\n== Languages ==\nIn 2008, the region [[Aquitaine]] made a survey on the languages in the region, and gave the following results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October\u2013November 2008|title=RESULTATS DE L\u2019ETUDE SOCIOLINGUISTIQUE : \"PRESENCE, PRATIQUES ET REPRESENTATIONS  DE LA LANGUE OCCITANE EN AQUITAINE\"|url=https://www.institut-bearnaisgascon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Avril_2009_Resultats_complets_enquete_sociolinguistique_occitan_en_Aquitaine-1.pdf|journal=Institut B\u00e9rnais et Guascon|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Languages in Aquitaine, 2008\n!Language\n!First languages\n!Total languages\n|-\n|French\n|86.1%\n|91.8%\n|-\n|English\n|8.7%\n|58.7%\n|-\n|Spanish\n|2.8%\n|44.1%\n|-\n|Occitan and other regional languages\n|0.6%\n|16.1%\n|-\n|German\n|0.4%\n|8.3%\n|-\n|Italian\n|0.3%\n|5.1%\n|-\n|Arabic\n|0.3%\n|2.9%\n|-\n|Basque\n|0.1%\n|1.7%\n|-\n|Other languages\n|0.7%\n|7.6%\n|-\n|Total\n|100.0%\n|236.3%\n|}\n\n== Climate ==\nThe region Nouvelle-Aquitaine essentially has a more or less altered [[oceanic climate]]. We distinguish the Aquitaine oceanic climate, which concerns most of the territory (Charentes to Landes), the Paris oceanic climate (Poitou), Limousin oceanic climate, tinged with semi-continental influences (Limousin) and basque microclimate, wetter (western half of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques and southern Landes). The Pyrenees has a specific climate that varies with altitude: the [[Pyrenean climate]], which is a variation of [[Alpine climate|mountain climate]].\n\n[[File:Une Vague - A wave.jpg|thumb|Wave at [[Saint-Cl\u00e9ment-des-Baleines]], on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]] ([[Charente-Maritime]]).]]\n\nIn the north of the region, the Paris oceanic climate is marked by moderate rainfall, warm summers and cool winters, but moderately so. The [[Seuil du Poitou]] acts as a relative climatic barrier and regions further south belong to the Aquitaine oceanic climate area. Coastal areas are wetter overall, with moderate rainfall spread throughout the year, except for the summer months, where droughts are not uncommon. Summer, which is relatively warm, is tempered by sea breezes, and winters are cool-mild. Frosts and snow are unusual. Sunshine is quite high, with around 2,000 to 2,200 hours per year, which is comparable to some Mediterranean regions ([[Perpignan]]). Summer precipitation often take the form of thunderstorms, possibly violent, while winter is sometimes marked by storms, some of which have marked the area with their exceptional: [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Martin]] in 1999 (record of 198&nbsp;km / h in [[Saint-Denis-d'Ol\u00e9ron]]), [[Cyclone Klaus|Klaus]] in 2009 (172&nbsp;km / h to [[Biscarrosse]]) and [[Cyclone Xynthia|Xynthia]] in 2010 (160&nbsp;km / h on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]]).\n\nThe climate in [[Angoumois]] and [[Limousin]] is wetter and cooler, remains temperate with warm spring and has relatively warm summers, with variations due to altitude. The annual sunshine averages at 1850 hours. The climate of the [[French Basque Country|Basque country]] and southern [[Landes (department)|Landes]] is marked by its warm summers, mild winters but especially by its high rainfall, with Atlantic depressions that hit the Pyrenean foothills. This Microclimate explains the presence of lush vegetation and the green aspect of the region. Fogs are not rare, but usually dissipate very quickly.\n\nAs for the Pyrenean climate, suboceanic trend [[B\u00e9arn]], it is subject to frequent \"cap effect\" when the north-west of disturbances abut against the Pyrenean mountains. Valley bottoms, true \"funnels clouds\" are particularly watered. The winter snow is important above 1200 meters. Pau valley has a microclimate, however, marked by strong sunlight (about 1900 hours a year) but high rainfall (1100&nbsp;mm per year) and a near absence of frost in winter. Rainfall is usually brief there, but regular, and spread throughout the year.\n\n== Transport ==\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine is a region of transit between the Paris Basin (including the Ile-de-France) and the Iberian Peninsula, but also between the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions (noon Toulouse). This situation implies several years developing roads and major highways, especially in the context of the road Estuaries, but also the high-speed Paris-Bordeaux-Toulouse-Spain, which should help significantly shorten rail journeys.\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nMany roads and highways in the region radiate from [[Bordeaux]] and just attach to its peripheral belt (Bordeaux ring road or [[A630 autoroute|A630]]). The main lines used for reinforcing roads and highways are in addition some terminal bonds designed to streamline access to two major resorts in the area, [[Arcachon]] (via Highway A660) and [[Royan]] (by via the N150, partly making 2X2 routes).\n\n[[File:ringbordeaux.jpg|thumb|The ring road of [[Bordeaux]] supports a particularly heavy traffic.]]\n\nThe [[A10 autoroute]] (the \"Aquitaine\") is the major artery between Bordeaux and [[Paris]], commissioned in 1981. It is part of to the network of \"autoroutes du Sud de la France\" and provides access to several cities: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], [[Niort]] or [[Poitiers]]. From Saintes, highway [[A837 autoroute|A837]] allows drivers to reach the town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Further north, in Niort, an interchange provides access to the [[A83 autoroute|A83]] motorway, the [[Vend\u00e9e]] and [[Nantes]] (Pays de la Loire). The N10 is the main road of the [[Charente]] and an important road for connecting between Bordeaux and Poitiers including [[Angoul\u00eame]].\n\nConnecting the east of Bordeaux ([[Libourne]]) to [[Lyon|Greater Lyon]], the [[A89 autoroute|A89]] motorway (called \"La transversale\") irrigates the eastern part of the region, facilitating travel between the cities of Bordeaux and [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], [[Tulle]] and [[Ussel, Lot|Ussel]]. A little further south, the D936, which roughly follows the course of the Dordogne, is grafted on the Bordeaux ring road via an interchange at the municipalities of [[Cenon]] and [[Floirac, Gironde|Floirac]]. It gives access to the towns of [[Branne, Gironde|Branne]], [[Castillon-la-Bataille]] and [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]] (Gironde) and [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (Dordogne).\n\nSoutheast of Bordeaux, an exchanger arranged at the ring road in the municipality of [[Gradignan]] allows access to the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], western part \"Entre-Deux-Mers\" motorway. Next a lateral axis at the Garonne, it can reach [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Marmande]], [[Agen]] and beyond, [[Toulouse]]. She just double the D10, on the right bank of the Garonne, which serves the southeast of the Gironde before heading down to the Landes. South of Langon, the [[A65 autoroute|A65]] motorway was commissioned in December 2010. Going through [[Bazas]], [[Mont-de-Marsan]] and [[Aire-sur-Adour]], she joined the [[Arrondissement of Pau|Greater Pau]] at [[Lescar]].\n\n[[File:Viaduc-du-chavanon cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The [[A89 autoroute|A89]] mark on the [[Chavanon Viaduct]] in [[Corr\u00e8ze]].]]\n\nSouthwest of Bordeaux, the [[A63 autoroute|A63]] is a major focus of the regional motorway network. Forming a large artery almost straight through the vast expanses of flat Landes de Gascogne, it crosses the south of Gironde and Landes (passes near [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] but avoids the prefecture, Mont-de-Marsan) before joining [[Bayonne]] and the Basque Country, to [[Irun]], on the Spanish border, the main border crossing. Particularly popular, especially during the summer, it supports an average daily traffic of 34,000 vehicles (8,000 trucks), increasing to 50,000 vehicles (10,000 trucks) during the months of summer. The other border crossings, less frequented but less direct, are the Somport tunnel and Col du Pourtalet.\n\nThe Basque country and B\u00e9arn are also served by a road parallel to the Pyrenees, which facilitates access to Toulouse and the Mediterranean regions: the [[A64 autoroute|A64]], called \"La Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne\". It starts from [[Briscous]] (in the outskirts of Bayonne), continues to [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] before reaching [[Tarbes]] in the neighbouring region of [[Occitanie]]) and the Toulouse ring road.\n\nThe eastern region is well served by the [[A20 autoroute|A20]] north-south axis between Paris and Toulouse and opens up Limousin. It thus goes through [[La Souterraine]], [[Limoges]] and [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]. Another important way, the European route E603 connects [[Limoges]] to [[Angoul\u00eame]] and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]]. It represents one of the key elements of the road Central Europe Atlantic important channel of communication between the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and the Atlantic coast, which is divided into multiple plots at Angoul\u00eame and Saintes (Bordeaux, Royan and La Rochelle).\n\n=== Rail network ===\n\nThe regional rail network is organised around the main towns: [[Bordeaux]], [[Limoges]], [[Poitiers]], [[La Rochelle]] and [[Bayonne]]. The main line is the one between [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] via Poitiers, Bordeaux and [[Hendaye]]; then comes the line [[Lille]]-[[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], which serves [[Limoges]], both served by [[TGV]] trains. Other lines are served mostly by the [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] network of [[TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine]].\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R03.jpg|thumb|With 10 million passengers a year, the [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]] station is the largest station in the region.]]\n\nThe largest station in the region is [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]], which accommodates 10 million passengers per year; then comes the [[Gare de Limoges-B\u00e9n\u00e9dictins|Limoges-B\u00e9n\u00e9dictins]] station and its 2.5 million passengers. Poitiers has two stations: [[Gare de Poitiers|Poitiers]] station and [[Gare du Futuroscope|Futuroscope]] station serving the technology park [[Futuroscope]]. [[Gare d'Angoul\u00eame|Angoul\u00eame]] station sees around 1.45 million passengers per year; [[Gare d'Agen|Agen]] station links the [[Occitanie]] region and hosts more than 1.3 million passengers per year; [[Gare de Pau|Pau]] station sees nearly 1 million passengers each year while the number of users of [[Gare de Dax|Dax]] station reached 820,000.\n\nThe implementation of the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]], which is part of a priority program initiated by the state, should facilitate trade. The journey time between Bordeaux and Paris ([[Gare Montparnasse|Montparnasse]]) is expected to reduce from three hours in 2015 to just over two hours in 2017. At the same time, the journey time between Poitiers and Paris should reduce from 1:30 to 1:15, between Angoul\u00eame and Paris from a little over two hours to 1:40 and between La Rochelle and Paris from just under three hours to 2:30. Journey times between several cities in the region will also be shortened, between Bordeaux and Angoul\u00eame reducing from just under an hour to a little over half an hour, and between Bordeaux and Poitiers reducing to approximately half-an-hour.\n\nAnother important project for the region, the [[LGV Bordeaux - Spain]] extends of the South Europe Atlantic TGV line to connect with the [[Basque Y]] (high-speed line linking the Spanish cities of [[Bilbao]], [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] and [[Irun]]). It is part of the great South West Rail project and should facilitate regional connections between Bordeaux, Mont-de-Marsan, Dax and Bayonne, long distance connections between the south of the region and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], and also international links to [[Spain]] (including Madrid).\n\nThe LGV Bar project between Poitiers - Limoges is part of this context, and should significantly shorten travel between the two cities (from just over an hour and a half to 45 minutes), facilitate interregional connections and access to the Ile-de-France. This project is one of the links of \"Transline project\" (Transversal Auvergne Atlantic Alpes), still under study.\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport|Bordeaux-Merignac]], world class, which hosts nearly four and a half million passengers per year and offers flights to many destinations; It is the seventh metropolitan France Airport (fifth if we except the Paris airports).\n\n[[File:Biarritz A\u00e9roport (1).jpg|thumb|The terminal of the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne Airport, which has the second greatest attendance in the region.]]\n\nThe second airport is [[Biarritz \u2013 Anglet \u2013 Bayonne Airport|Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne]], which offers flights to several European countries and hosts a little over a million passengers; it ranks in 17th position at Metropolitan France. Third airport in the region, [[Pau Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport]] welcomes approximately 650,000 passengers per year. Then the airport of [[Limoges \u2013 Bellegarde Airport|Limoges-Bellegarde]], hosting nearly 300,000 passengers per year and [[Bergerac Dordogne P\u00e9rigord Airport]], created in 1990 and whose attendance has increased from 16,000 passengers a year in 2002 to 260,000 in 2010.\n\nThe [[La Rochelle \u2013 \u00cele de R\u00e9 Airport|airport of La Rochelle - \u00cele de R\u00e9]] offers flights to several French and European cities and welcomes approximately 215,000 passengers per year. Smaller, airports [[Poitiers\u2013Biard Airport|Poitiers-Biard]] (100,000 annual passengers), [[Brive\u2013Souillac Airport|Brive Dordogne]] (60,000 passengers), [[Agen La Garenne Airport|Agen-La Garenne]] (40,000 passengers) and [[P\u00e9rigueux Bassillac Airport|P\u00e9rigueux-Bassillac]] (8000 passengers) offer mainly domestic flights. Airports [[Angoul\u00eame \u2013 Cognac International Airport|Angoul\u00eame-Cognac]] and [[Rochefort \u2013 Charente-Maritime Airport|Rochefort-Charente-Maritime]] are only turned to business flights in the absence of regular commercial lines.\n\n=== Harbours ===\n\nCruise ships mostly dock in the ports of La Rochelle (terminal [[La Pallice]]), Verdon-sur-Mer (shuttles for [[Royan]]), [[Pauillac]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Bayonne]].\n\n[[File:Port de Royan de Nuit (2).jpg|thumb|[[Royan]] harbour by night.]]\n\nMany marinas are open to smaller boats. The main ones are those of [[La Rochelle]] (4800 rings), [[Arcachon]] (2600 rings), [[Port-M\u00e9doc]] (1200 rings), [[Royan]] (1000 rings), of [[Capbreton]] (950 rings), [[Hendaye]] (800 rings), [[Saint-Denis-d'Ol\u00e9ron]] (750 rings) and [[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] (425 rings).\n\nRiver transport is active on several rivers in the region: [[Charente (river)|Charente]] (mainly between [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Angoul\u00eame]]), [[Gironde estuary]], [[Garonne]], [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]], [[Lot (river)|Lot]], [[Baise]] and [[Adour]].\n\nLandmark river tourism, the Canal de Garonne is an extension of the [[Canal du Midi]] (which together form the \"Canal des Deux-Mers\" between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean). It passes including [[Agen]] (Agen aqueduct) and continues until [[Castets-en-Dorthe]] (Gironde).\n\nThe entire watershed of the Dordogne is classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 11 July 2012 with the co-ordination structure Institution of regional public Dordogne basin. The basin of the Dordogne is one of the few places in France where the presence of eight migratory fish species proved with Atlantic salmon, sea trout, river lamprey, sea lamprey, Allis shad, shad feigned, eel, and sturgeon in Europe. Other species associated with water, such as the common otter and the European mink, or the penny whistle swimming, are also present.\n\nTwo water agencies (Adour-Garonne and Loire-Bretagne) are involved in water management in the region.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 177.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.5% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,500 euros or 88% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe economy of the region is based on several pillars: diversified [[agriculture]], a set of famous vineyards ([[Bordeaux wine]], brandies of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]]), but also a decisive role in the industry sectors [[aerospace]], defence, [[biotechnology]], [[chemistry]] and more generally for [[scientific research]], relying on a network of universities and [[Grandes Ecoles]].\n\n[[File:Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck R02.jpg|thumb|The business district of [[M\u00e9riadeck]] at [[Bordeaux]], remained on a human scale.]]\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine can also count on a large image and digital sector (\"Campus de l'Image\" of [[Angoul\u00eame]], future \"Cit\u00e9 Num\u00e9rique\" of [[B\u00e8gles]]), a dense network of small and medium enterprises, the presence in its territory of large [[agribusiness]] as well as a port network including three major commercial ports being balanced due to their geographical position ([[La Pallice|Grand Port maritime de La Rochelle]] in the north, [[Port of Bordeaux|Grand Port maritime de Bordeaux]] and [[port of Bayonne]] in the south). In 2013, a survey conducted by the weekly \"[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]\" classed Bordeaux as second best of most French cities \"business friendly\" in the category of cities with over 500,000 inhabitants (and the best economic environment), [[Poitiers]], [[La Rochelle]] and [[Bayonne]] respectively in second, third and fourth in population centers from 100,000 to 200,000 inhabitants. In 2014, a new survey, conducted this time by the \"Great Place To Work\" Institute, gives Bordeaux as a city considered the most attractive by salaried workers.\n\nThe new area boasts natural and heritage assets that make it a tourist destination of foreground, materialised by a wide ocean frontage structured around three major resorts \"historical\" ([[Arcachon]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Royan]]), a series of winter sports stations in the heart of the Pyrenean massif ([[Gourette]], [[Le Somport]]) and leading historical sites ([[Lascaux]] caves, medieval city - and \"wine Mecca\" - of [[Saint-\u00c9milion]], martyr village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]) visited by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n=== Agricultural and wine sectors ===\nAn important rural Region, Nouvelle-Aquitaine has a varied agriculture. Cattle breeding (regional races: [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin]], Bordelais, [[Parthenais]], [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]], Gasconne, [[Bazadais]] and B\u00e9arnais) is predominant in the Bressuirais and Confolentais grove and in the Aunisienne plain, on the high Limousin plateau, in the Bazadaises and Chalossiennes Hills and is used both in the production of meat to milk production. There are also two other bovine regional breeds do not belong to the list of official French breeds (Marinelandaise and Betizu) endangered. The area has many quality labels (\"Veau fermier \u00e9lev\u00e9 sous la m\u00e8re\", Limousin beef ...).\n\n[[File:Blonde Aquitaine.jpg|thumb|[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] in the [[Pyrenees]].]]\n\nGoats (regional breeds: Poitevine, Pyrenees and Massif Central) are mainly concentrated in the north of the region (Charente, Charente-Maritime, Deux-S\u00e8vres and Vienne) and are used for cheese production ([[chabichou]], [[Mothais sur feuille]], \"Jonch\u00e9e\"). These four departments alone account for 30% of French goat herd, more than 200,000 heads. Some departments complement this area (Corr\u00e8ze and Dordogne with a part of the production  of [[Rocamadour cheese|Rocamadour]] [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]]). Sheep farming (regional races: Basque-b\u00e9arnaise, Landes, limousine, manech black head, red head and Xaxi Ardia) is well represented in the Limousin (Limousin lamb) the Charentes (lamb Poitou-Charentes), the M\u00e9doc (Pauillac lamb) and the Basque and Bearn Pyrenees.\n\nPig farming, which represents a significant part of the agri-food sector is distributed throughout the region (regional races: black ass Limousin, Gascon pork pie black Basque) and is guaranteed by the label \"porc du Sud-Ouest \". The pigs in the region are used to produce many meat products, starting with the famous Bayonne ham. Many farms have also specialised in poultry production including yellow chicken Saint-Sever and poultry of S\u00e8vres val (regional races Barbezieux, Limousin, Gascony, Landes and Marans) and fat waterfowl (mule ducks and geese), primarily designed for the production of foie gras and confit. Nouvelle-Aquitaine is the first European region for foie gras (more than half the French production). The label \"Canard \u00e0 foie gras du Sud-Ouest\" occupies a large part of the region.\n\nThe region is the birthplace of many other breeds (regional donkey breeds: the Pyrenees and Poitou, regional equine: Poitevin mule, Landais and Pottock).\n\nThe area is also an important oyster production center, with oysters \" de Claires\" from [[Marennes, Charente-Maritime|Marennes]]-[[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]] (in the estuary of the [[Seudre]]) and those of [[Arcachon]] and [[Cap Ferret]] and a stronghold of the mussel with mussels from Aiguillon Bay (near [[La Rochelle]]) and mussel Boyardville and [[Port-des-Barques]].\n\nThe decrease in fishery resources has led to a drop in tonnage of fish in the main ports of the region, however, remain very active. In 2014, the first port in the region (port and eighth highest tonnage nationally) is that of [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]-[[Ciboure]], or share about 7600 tons of fish, and annual business 23 million euros. This is followed by the port of [[Saint-Pierre-d'Ol\u00e9ron|La Cotini\u00e8re]] on Oleron island, sixth French fishing port for sales specialising in species 'nobles' (5300 tons of fish landed). Then there are the ports of [[La Rochelle]], [[Royan]], [[Arcachon]], [[Capbreton]] and [[Hendaye]].\n\n[[File:Remy Martin XO - Louis XIII - Hennessy Paradis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cognac]], one of two regional famous brandies with [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]].]]\n\n[[Viticulture]] is a key sector of the local economy, the region with the presence of some of the most prestigious French vineyards: vineyards of Bordeaux, Bergerac, Cognac (production of [[Cognac]] and [[Pineau des Charentes]]) and partially, Armagnac (production of [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]] and [[Floc de Gascogne]]), Southwest vineyards in the valleys of the Garonne and Lot, vineyard slopes of the Pyrenees ([[juran\u00e7on]], [[iroul\u00e9guy]]) and vineyards of Haut-Poitou. The vineyards of the Limousin, formerly prolific now confidential, but continues to provide quality wines (vineyards [[Verneuil-sur-Vienne]] and Correze vineyard, including giving the wine country and the Correze \"vin paill\u00e9\" of [[Queyssac-les-Vignes]]).\n\nThe region plays a vital role for cereal crops (wheat), herbage and oil (corn, sunflower), which bloom in the valleys of the Adour, Charente and the Garonne. Large agricultural cooperatives are located in the area: Lur Berri, Ma\u00efsadour, or Natea Charentes Alliance. In Charente-Maritime, the small town of [[Saint-Genis-de-Saintonge]] developed the largest French [[popcorn]] production unit: 70% of the national production comes out of his ateliers.\n\n[[Tobacco]] production remains important in [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]] area around [[La R\u00e9ole]], [[Auros]], [[Mons\u00e9gur, Gironde|Mons\u00e9gur]] and [[Bazas]] (Gironde) in [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]], in Dordogne and in the Lot-et-Garonne, which occurred to him only 14% of the French Tobacco nearly 800 hectares. Mixed farming has led to the establishment of more localised cultures, but nevertheless considered: P\u00e9rigord walnuts, Limousin apples, strawberries valleys of the Dordogne and Lot, Charentais melons hillsides, beans (\"mojhettes\") of val d'Arnoult and the Marais Poitevin, the [[Marmande]] tomatoes, peppers from Landes and the Basque Country, the most famous representative is the [[Espelette pepper]].\n\nThe agri-food sector is characterised by the presence of several national brands and international production sites, including [[Madrange]] ([[Limoges]]), [[Bl\u00e9dina]] ([[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]), Marie ([[Airvault]] and [[Mirebeau]]) [[Senoble]] ([[Aytr\u00e9]], near [[La Rochelle]] ), [[Lu, Cestas|Lu]] ([[Cestas]], near [[Bordeaux]]) [[C\u00e9moi]] ([[B\u00e8gles]], near [[Bordeaux]]), [[Charal]] ([[\u00c9gletons]], in Corr\u00e8ze), Valade Group ([[Lubersac]], in Corr\u00e8ze) or [[Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli]] ([[Oloron-Sainte-Marie]]). [[Labeyrie, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Labeyrie]] headquartered in [[Came]] in the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] and [[Delpeyrat]] in [[Mont-de-Marsan]], in the Landes.\n\n=== Forest resources ===\n\nThe region has significant forest resources.\n\nThe timber industry consists of two main types of activities that mainly use the wood of the Landes forest and secondarily of the Dordogne, Creuse, Corr\u00e8ze and Haute-Vienne. The primary processing industries (pulp, sawing, slicing, etc.) are very often the result of large companies to perform operations that require large investments. The secondary processing industries (paper / cardboard, furniture, woodwork and plywood, etc.) do not require as many resources. They are more dispersed geographically and in the hands of smaller-scale undertakings or craft.\n\nThe timber industry is large enough to get the support of local authorities throughout the years. Thus is explained obtaining national competitiveness cluster label for the \"Xylofutur\" whose main purpose is to bring innovative projects to benefit the entire industry. Directly related to the timber industry, the Charente stationery has adapted to globalisation by producing special paper (paper packaging, greaseproof paper, recycled paper and corrugated cardboard).\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nThe region is a major international center in the field of aeronautics and space industry. Together with the neighbouring region [[Occitanie]], it belongs to the [[Aerospace Valley]] world-class industry cluster. The regional aerospace sector is closely linked to the defence sector, leading to talk of industry \"ASD\" (aeronautics, space and defence).\n\nThe regional [[aircraft industry]] is a world leader for business aircraft, high-tech batteries, high performance composite materials, landing gear systems and turbines for helicopters, the European leader for military aircraft, cockpit equipment and systems, ground tests and flight, launchers, solid propulsion, airborne radars and systems, weapons systems deterrence, atmospheric re-entry technology and national leader in the interior design of 'business aircraft, aircraft maintenance, UAV systems.\n\n[[File:Rafale 070412-N-8157C-542.JPEG|thumb|Many \"[[Dassault Rafale|Rafales]]\" are assembled in [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]], in the [[Bordeaux]] metropolis.]]\n\nThe main sites are located in the city of Bordeaux, but also in the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] and in [[Vienne]]. Of these, [[Dassault Aviation]] has five establishments in M\u00e9rignac (final assembly and commissioning flight Rafale and Falcon), [[Martignas-sur-Jalle]] (wing civilian and military aircraft), Biarritz (composites and assembly of structures), [[Cazaux]] (integration and armament test) and Poitiers (production of military aircraft canopy). [[Thales Group]] has two sites near Bordeaux: Pessac (aircraft embedded systems: mission computers, airborne radars combat and surveillance, unmanned aerial systems) and Hailsham (design and development of cockpit systems for major aircraft manufacturers in the world ). [[Airbus Defence and Space]] (development and production of [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] launchers and of ballistic missiles for the [[Force de dissuasion|French nuclear force]]) is located in [[Saint-M\u00e9dard-en-Jalles]]. [[Safran]] has two major production facilities in the region: Turbomeca (world leader in helicopter turbines) near Pau and Snecma (maintenance and repair of military engines) in [[Ch\u00e2tellerault]].\n\nThe region is also home to several military airbases, including a command center of the [[French Air Force]]. It also hosts major defence-related facilities such as the [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule|Megajoule laser]] and the main [[DGA Essais de missiles|rocket testing facility]] of the [[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'armement]].\n\n[[File:Turbom\u00e9ca Arriel cutaway.jpg|thumb|left|The Turbomeca Arriel [[turboshaft]] engine, manufactured in [[Bordes, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Bordes]] (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques).]]\n\nThe pharmaceutical and parachemical industry is particularly well represented in the city of Bordeaux: [[Sanofi]] has three sites on the outskirts of Bordeaux, [[Ambar\u00e8s-et-Lagrave]] (production) [[Floirac, Gironde|Floirac]] (IT) and [[Saint-Loub\u00e8s]] (logistics); Meda Pharma Group is located in M\u00e9rignac; The Merck Group operates a production unit in [[Martillac]]. Finally, CEVA Animal Health in [[Libourne]], with more than 500 employees, originally created by Sanofi, now owned by its employees, is (in the company) the ninth largest veterinary pharmaceutical group.\n\nIn [[Agen]], the UPSA Company (scientific pharmacology Union applied), sold to the US group Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 1994, remains one of the biggest local and regional employers with 1,400 employees. Two factories and a logistics platform allow the market to deliver the full range of analgesics from aspirin and paracetamol to morphine. Since 1994, the US group has invested regularly in its two Agenais units that deliver half of their export production.\n\n[[Limoges]], long specialised in manufacturing and luxury (shoes, porcelain ...), is now a major cluster in the field of ceramics research (European Ceramics Pole). Legrand, French industrial group historically based in Limoges in the Limousin, is a world leader in products and systems for electrical installations and information networks. Ester Technology Park, is a business and research center that develops north of the city on several areas: ceramics; materials and surface treatments; electronics, optics and telecommunications; Health biotechnology; water and environment; Engineering in association with the [[University of Limoges]].\n\n[[Niort]] has developed over many years a financial sector based economy (insurance), and has now the fourth greatest number of flows in the French financial market (behind [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Lille]]). Headquarters of many [[mutual fund]]s, including the \"Three M\" ([[Macif]], [[Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund|MAIF]] and Maaf), the city is also seventh in regard to senior positions. The share of the financial activities sector jobs and insurance is far more important than in the rest of the country, reaching 18% in the urban area of Niort (against 3.7% in the rest of France).\n\nThe oil and gas industry is also represented in the region, with the [[Lacq gas field]] near Pau, which was France's main source of natural gas in the 1970s.\n\n=== Tourism ===\nTourism is an important sector in a region with significant assets, starting with a mild and sunny climate, famous vineyards (wine tourism) and many heritage sites, some of international renown. Its wide ocean frontage, stormed by thousands of vacationers - and surfers - every summer is characterised by sandy beaches that often stretch to the horizon. Indirect consequence of increasingly popular for water sports, many surf-related brands (mainly clothing and equipment) are present in the region, earning him the nickname \"Glissicon Valley\" in reference to [[Silicon Valley]]: [[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], [[Quiksilver]], [[O'Neill (brand)|O'Neill]]\u2026\n\n[[File:Surf Lacanau.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Surf culture]]\" very present on the coast - here in Lacanau \u2013 is the reason of the establishment in the area of brands related to this sector ([[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]]...)]]\n\nIn the northern part of the coast, the Charente archipelago consists mainly islands of [[\u00eele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]], [[\u00eele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]] and [[\u00eele d'Aix|Aix]], where alternate sheltered coves and beaches opening onto the open sea. The aunisiennes coast, near [[La Rochelle]], greet some family seaside resorts such as [[Ch\u00e2telaillon-Plage]] or [[Fouras]]. Further south, in the heart of the C\u00f4te de Beaut\u00e9 (Coast of Beauty), [[Royan]] is one of three major seaside resorts in the region. She has five beaches, not to mention those of neighbouring towns and the C\u00f4te Sauvage (Wild Coast) of the peninsula of Arvert, Mecca of surfing and board sports.\n\nBeyond the Gironde estuary begins the C\u00f4te d\u2019Argent (Silver Coast), large expanse of almost straight sand bordered by pine trees and large lakes Landes, punctuated by small resorts such as [[Soulac-sur-Mer]], [[Vendays-Montalivet]] (famous for its naturist center) [[Hourtin]], [[Lacanau]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]], [[Hossegor]] or [[Capbreton]]. The [[Bassin d'Arcachon]], which forms an indentation between Gironde and Landes coast, focuses on [[Arcachon]], another seaside resort, nestled in the heart of the pine forest. It faces the [[Cap Ferret]], beaten by the waves of the ocean. In continuation of the C\u00f4te d'Argent, the Basque coast is structured around [[Biarritz]], Mecca of seaside tourism, [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and [[Hendaye]], and is famous for its eroded cliffs and powerful rollers which make it a favourite spot for surfers.\n\nWinter sports enthusiasts are in the Pyrenean several stations where to practice skiing, snowboarding and snowblade. The main ones are [[Gourette]], [[Artouste]], [[La Pierre Saint-Martin]], [[Issarbe]], [[Le Somport]], [[Iraty]] or [[Somport-Candanchu]].\n\nMany spas are located in the region, starting with [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], but also [[Eaux-Bonnes]], [[Eug\u00e9nie-les-Bains]], [[Saint-Paul-l\u00e8s-Dax]], [[Salies-de-B\u00e9arn]], [[Cambo-les-Bains]], [[Jonzac]], [[Saujon]], [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], [[La Roche-Posay]] or [[\u00c9vaux-les-Bains]].\n\nAmong the other sites with large numbers of visitors, many have higher attendance than one million people a year: the park [[Futuroscope]] in [[Poitiers]] (1.8 million visitors), the most visited site outside the \u00cele de-France, the old town of [[Sarlat-la-Can\u00e9da|Sarlat]] (1.5 million visitors), [[Dune du Pilat]], near [[Arcachon]], (1.4 million visitors), or the historic town of [[Saint-Emilion]], near [[Libourne]] ( about 1 million visitors).\n\n[[Aquarium de La Rochelle]] approach (850,000 visitors), as well as the [[La Palmyre Zoo]] (700,000 visitors), the largest private zoo in Europe, near [[Royan]]. The medieval village of [[Collonges-la-Rouge]] (500,000 visitors), the Southwest [[Walibi]] theme park in [[Roquefort, Lot-et-Garonne|Roquefort]], near [[Agen]] (300,000 visitors), the small train of Rhune near Bayonne (about 360,000 visitors), the center of memory and martyr village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], near [[Limoges]] (300,000 visitors), the caves of [[Lascaux]] -

Its largest city, [[Bordeaux]], together with its suburbs and satellite cities, forms the 7th-largest metropolitan area of France, with 850,000 inhabitants. The region has 25 major urban areas, among which the most important after Bordeaux are [[Bayonne]] (288,000 inhabitants), [[Limoges]] (283,000), [[Poitiers]] (255,000), [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] (241,000), and [[La Rochelle]] (206,000), as well as 11 major clusters. The growth of its population, particularly marked on the coast, makes this one of the most attractive areas economically in France; the new region outperforms the [[\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]] in demographic dynamism.\n\nAfter \u00cele-de-France, New Aquitaine is the premier French region in research and innovation, with five universities ([[University of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], [[University of La Rochelle|La Rochelle]], [[University of Limoges|Limoges]], [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]] and [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour|Pau]]) and several [[Grandes \u00e9coles|Grandes Ecoles]]. The agricultural region of Europe with the greatest turnover, it is the French region with the most tourism jobs, as it has three of the four historic resorts on the French Atlantic coast: ([[Arcachon]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Royan]]), as well as several ski resorts (e.g. [[Gourette]]), and is the fifth French region for business creation (all sectors).\n\nIts economy is based on [[agriculture]] and [[viticulture]] ([[Bordeaux wine|vineyards of Bordeaux]] and [[Cognac]]), [[tourism]], a powerful [[aerospace industry]], [[digital economy]] and design, parachemical and pharmaceutical industries, [[financial sector]] ([[Niort]] is the fourth-largest financial center in the nation, specialising in mutual insurance companies), and industrial ceramics ([[Limoges]]).\n\nThe new region includes major parts of [[Southern France]] (\"Midi de la France\"), marked by [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Langues d'o\u00efl|O\u00efl]] ([[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]] and [[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) cultures.

Taking into consideration the urban area, the new region is home to six of the fifty largest metropolitan areas of French territory (population 2011):\n\n* Bordeaux (1,140,668 inhabitants)\n* [[Bayonne]] (283,571)\n* [[Limoges]] (282,876)\n* [[Poitiers]] (254 051)\n* [[Arrondissement of Pau|Pau]] (240,898)\n* [[La Rochelle]] (205,822).\n\nIn addition, the region has a network of medium towns scattered throughout its territory, including:\n\n* [[Angoul\u00eame]] (108,304)\n* [[Agen]] (79,764)\n* [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]] (75,925)\n* [[Niort]] (71,046)\n* [[P\u00e9rigueux]] (66,423)\n* [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (64,427)\n* [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot]] (49,354)\n* [[Arrondissement of Dax|Dax]] (48,820)\n* [[Mont-de-Marsan]] (40,269)\n\n=== Geographical features ===\n\nThe region covers a large part of the [[Aquitaine Basin]] and a small portion of the [[Paris Basin]] (the border between the two being located at the \"[[Seuil du Poitou]]\") and the Limousin plate (part of the Massif Central) and the western part of the [[Pyrenees]]. It is part of five watersheds facing the Atlantic Ocean: [[Loire]], [[Charente (river)|Charente]], [[Garonne]] and [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]] (and their extension, the [[Gironde estuary]]) and [[Adour]], giving rivers bordering land dedicated mostly to viticulture and to agriculture.\n\n[[File:Dune du Pyla-08.jpg|thumb|left|The [[dune of Pilat]] is the tallest sand dune in Europe.]]\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine also relies on the presence of a large open coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], from the National Nature Reserve Aiguillon Bay and the estuary of the [[S\u00e8vre Niortaise|S\u00e8vre]] (north [[Charron, Charente-Maritime|Charron]]) than [[Bidasoa]] (south of [[Hendaye]]) and including the islands of the Charentais Archipelago (islands of [[\u00cele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]], [[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]], [[\u00cele d'Aix|Aix]] and [[\u00eele Madame|Madame]]) and the wide notch from Arcachon. This diverse area is the area of the oyster (Marennes-Ol\u00e9ron and the Bassin d\u2019Arcachon), mussel (mussels from Baie de l\u2019Aiguillon), and Tourism, evidenced by the presence of famous resorts such [[Arcachon]] (C\u00f4te d\u2019Argent), [[Biarritz]] (C\u00f4te Basque) and [[Royan]] (C\u00f4te de Beaut\u00e9).\n\nFrom the {{Interlanguage link multi|Arvert peninsula|fr|3=Presqu'\u00eele d'Arvert}} to the coast of [[Labourd]], the coastline, almost straight, is lined with high dunes, rising to the [[Dune du Pilat]], large lakes ([[Lac d'Hourtin-Carcans]], [[\u00e9tang de Lacanau]], [[\u00e9tang de Cazaux et de Sanguinet]] , [[lac de Biscarrosse et de Parentis]]...) and wetlands (r\u00e9serve naturelle nationale des dunes et marais d'Hourtin) above vast pine forests planted in the nineteenth century. The [[Landes forest]], by far the most extensive, covering almost one million hectares (nearly 950,000 of maritimes pins), making it the largest artificial forest of Western Europe. Forming a vast triangle starting from the [[Pointe de Grave]], north of [[Soulac-sur-Mer]] to [[Soorts-Hossegor|Hossegor]] in the south and east [[N\u00e9rac]], it replaced the thankless, sandy and marshy moorland that characterised the region for centuries. The Landes forest is partially included in the [[Landes de Gascogne Regional Natural Park]], which begins south of [[Bordeaux]].\n\nFurther north, in the wake of the Landes forest, on the right bank of the [[Gironde estuary]], the [[forest of la Coubre]] presents the same characteristics, forming the main \"green lung\" of [[Royan]] on nearly 8000 hectares. Other important forests cover the region: in the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]], the [[Irati Forest]] covers over 17,000 hectares; at the borders of the Charente, Charente-Maritime and Dordogne, the forest of the Double, punctuated by nearly 500 lakes, spans about 50,000 hectares; further north, near [[Poitiers]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Mouli\u00e8re forest|fr|3=For\u00eat de Mouli\u00e8re}} stretches nearly 6,800 hectares. Further east, close to [[Gu\u00e9ret]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chabri\u00e8res forest|fr|3=For\u00eat de Chabri\u00e8res}} reaches 2000 hectares.\n\n[[File:Ossau face est01.jpg|thumb|The [[pic du Midi d'Ossau]].]]\n\nThe extreme southern region has a mountainous character with the presence of the [[Pyrenees]]. If its western part (mountains of Labourd) is made more high green hills generally struggling to reach 1000 meters ([[Larrun|La Rhune]], near [[Bayonne]], is 905 meters high, but further east, the culmination of [[French Basque Country]], the [[pic d'Orhy]], nevertheless amounts to 2017 m), the [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] region is marked by more mineral landscapes, and is surrounded by high peaks often exceeding 2000 meters. The highlight of the region, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic Palas|simple}} (2974 m) is located not far away. Other Pyrenean peaks located in the region are also spectacular [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]] (2884 meters), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Arriel|fr}} (2824 m), the [[Pic de Ger]] (2613 m) near the Winter resort [[Gourette]], [[Pic d'Anie]] (2504 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Latte de Bazen|fr}} (2472 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Ansab\u00e8re|eu|3=Ansab\u00e8re}} (2377 m), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic de l'Arraille|fr}} (2147 m) or the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pic d'Arlas|ru|3=\u0410\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0441}} (2044 m).\n\nThis hilly region is traversed many mountain streams, called [[Gave (placename element)|gaves]]: among these include the [[Gave de Pau]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gave de Bious|fr}} the [[Gave d'Ossau]] or the [[Gaves r\u00e9unis]], on the border of Landes and Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques. [[Ossau Valley]], one of the three valleys of [[B\u00e9arn]], extends from the suburbs of Pau to [[Col du Pourtalet]] to the Spanish border. Glacial lakes, its fauna and flora exceptional explain its integration into the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]].\n\nBelonging to the [[Massif Central]], [[Limousin]] also has a marked relief, with its high [[plateau]]x and some hedgerow eroded peaks that dominate green valleys and forests of oak and chestnut trees. Limousin plateau, cut by the valleys of the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne]] (who waters his capital, [[Limoges]]) [[Isle (river)|Isle]], [[V\u00e9z\u00e8re]] or the picturesque [[Corr\u00e8ze (river)|Corr\u00e8ze]], with its cashed reliefs, hardly exceeds 500 meters. It marks the watershed line between the [[Loire]] basin to the north (the sources of the [[Briance]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Aixette|de}}, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gr\u00eane|de}} or the [[Gorre]]), the basin south of the Dordogne (sources of [[Dronne]], of Isle and of [[Auv\u00e9z\u00e8re]]) and maritime watershed of the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], in the west.\n\n[[File:S\u00e9di\u00e8res 1 110.jpg|thumb|left|Typical landscape in [[Corr\u00e8ze]].]]\n\nThe mountains of Limousin, which include a series of small mountains (mont Fayat, Monedi\u00e8res Hills, mont de Ch\u00e2lus) peak at Mont Bessou (976 m), in Corr\u00e8ze. Further north, the mountains of Marche, which are divided into mountains of monts de Gu\u00e9ret, mont d'Ambazac and monts de Blond, are more like high wooded hills dotted with pastures, as real peaks. They culminate in Signal de Sauvagnac (701 m), in Haute-Vienne. Southwest of Limousin and P\u00e9rigord northwest since 1998 are integrated to the [[Parc naturel r\u00e9gional P\u00e9rigord Limousin]].\n\nThe northern part of the region, which corresponds to the Haut-Poitou history, is organised around a tray agricultural and viticultural (vineyard of Haut-Poitou) irrigated by the [[Vienne]], [[Clain]] or the [[Gartempe]], which form so little valleys, often lined with oak forests. Further south, the Niortais this open landscapes (openfields) in grain dominant, but also rich wetland areas such as the [[Marais Poitevin]], a legacy of an old marine gulf filled with alluvium, which is divided into wet marshes (we speaks more readily of \"Green Venice\") and marshes dried up, converted into mixed farming. [[Niort]], on the [[S\u00e8vre Niortaise]], main town of the Haut-Poitou outside [[Poitiers]], is like a door of this \"Green Venice\" much of which belongs to the [[Marais Poitevin|parc naturel r\u00e9gional du Marais poitevin]], established in 1979, classified \"Grand site de France\".\n\nFurther south lie the Charentes, which correspond to the former provinces of [[Aunis]], [[Angoumois]] and [[Saintonge]]. Aunis is not unlike the landscape of Niortais, with large marshes that extend from either side of [[La Rochelle]] and [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] (Baie d'Yves, marais de Rochefort, Broue and [[Brouage]]) but also the islands of [[\u00cele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]] and [[\u00cele d'Aix|Aix]], with varied landscapes where pine forests mingle, sandy beaches or the curious lagoon of Fier d'Ars, the sands in constant motion, which houses a bird sanctuary. The interior of the territory is marked by the presence of a rich plain cereal evoking the [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] by its open relief on the horizon. At the center of this space, the city of [[Surg\u00e8res]] remained a pastureland where dairy farming has retained its importance: the small city is thus a production centers butter, Beurre de Charentes-Poitou.\n\n[[File:Le Vanneau-Passerelle.jpg|thumb|Between [[Poitou]] and [[Charente-Maritime]], the [[Marais Poitevin]].]]\n\nThe [[Angoumois]] forms a transitional space between the coastal plains of Aunis, large \"champagne\" of Saintonge and Limousin plateau. Dotted with small hills, he seems to live to the rhythm of the Charente, real artery watering its major cities, [[Angoul\u00eame]], [[Cognac, France|Cognac]] and [[Jarnac]]. Great wine region, internationally renowned alcohol is produced there, [[cognac]], and a water spirits called [[Pineau des Charentes]]. The western quarter of Charentes consists of Saintonge, organised territory around the towns of [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], the first capital of Aquitaine in Roman times, and [[Royan]].\n\nIn continuation of the Angoumois, the Dordogne approximately corresponds to the former province of [[P\u00e9rigord]]. Taking its name from the river of the same name, which flows [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] but not its prefecture, [[P\u00e9rigueux]] (the edge of the [[Isle (river)|Isle]]), the area with varied landscapes has a large afforestation rate (45%) making it the third most wooded department France. The great forests of oak and chestnut trees of green P\u00e9rigord, organised around [[Nontron]], meet the great grain fields of the White P\u00e9rigord, nicknamed \"the breadbasket of the P\u00e9rigord\", the oak, walnut and black P\u00e9rigord truffle, around [[Sarlat-la-Caneda]] and vineyards of Bergerac or purple P\u00e9rigord, which produces Bergerac, monbazillac or p\u00e9charmant.\n\n[[File:Roseli\u00e8re de Pauillac et carrelets sur l'estuaire de la Gironde, France.jpg|thumb|The [[Gironde estuary]] is the largest estuary in western Europe.]]\n\nThe [[Gironde estuary]], which acts as a link between [[Saintonge]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Blayais|oc|3=Blai\u00e9s}}, [[M\u00e9doc]] and western [[Guyenne]], is in itself a world apart. Wild largest estuary in Europe, being classified in the marine park with the \"Pertuis charentais\", it is lined with large marshes (\"Petite Camargue\" and hillsides which produces most of the great Bordeaux wines from the C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux and C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg on the right bank to the great wines of the left bank M\u00e9doc (Pauillac, Margaux, Saint-Est\u00e8phe, Saint-Julien. The vineyards of Bordeaux, with international reputation, has done for centuries the reputation of the region. His productions are exported worldwide.\n\nFarther south lies the vast plain Landes (south of Gironde and Landes), which begins near Bordeaux and go to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. Largely occupied by the [[Landes forest]], it is also a major agricultural area (maize farming) and hosts a spa of international reputation, Dax, also the capital of [[Chalosse]], important breeding ground.\n\n[[File:Bassin d'Arcachon - Cabanes tchanqu\u00e9es.jpg|thumb|\"Cabanes tchanqu\u00e9es\" in the [[bassin d'Arcachon]].]]\n\nThe coastline subject to severe erosion, remained very wild. Some resorts have been built in the dunes from [[Soulac-sur-Mer]] in the north of the Gironde, via [[Lacanau]], [[Hourtin]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]] and [[Capbreton]], without forgetting those bordering the Bay of Arcachon: [[Arcachon]], [[Andernos-les-Bains]], [[L\u00e8ge-Cap-Ferret]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pyla-sur-Mer|es}}. This vast lagoon, wide open ocean, houses since 2014 the marine natural park of Arcachon basin.\n\nEastern Guyenne corresponds in part to the department of [[Lot-et-Garonne]]. Rich agricultural and farming area watered by both the [[Lot (river)|Lot]] and the [[Garonne]], it is famous for its \"[[prune]]aux\", who took the name of its capital, [[Agen]] (nearly 8000 hectares of land are dedicated to Ente plum orchards) while [[Marmande]] is famous for its tomatoes. The mild climate explains that also cultivated [[tobacco]], as well as strawberries (\"gariguettes\") and vines, used to produce the C\u00f4tes du marmandais the buzet or C\u00f4te de Brulhois, that relate to the broad vineyard of the Southwest. But the real glory of this land is [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], a famous brandy, exported around the world. Its vineyards cover some of the departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Landes but also the [[Gers]] (in the neighbouring region of [[Occitanie]]). It also produces the [[floc de Gascogne]], with delicate floral accents.\n\nThe extreme south of the region consists of two territories in strong identity, the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] (Northern Basque Country or \"Iparralde\") and [[B\u00e9arn]]. The first, which is organised around [[Bayonne]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] (Labourd) [[Maul\u00e9on-Licharre]] (Soule) and [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] (Lower Navarre) has its warm and humid climate its green side, the Atlantic rains from butter against the Pyrenean barrier. The coast, with its posh resorts or family, makes it a popular holiday resort. The interior, more rural, retains a strong agricultural tradition and a solid wine region, symbolised by the vineyard iroul\u00e9guy but also by traditional liquors such as [[Izarra (liqueur)|izarra]] and [[patxaran]], eau-de-vie characteristic of [[Navarre]] .\n\nAnchored in the heart of the Pyrenees, the B\u00e9arn opposes his Gascon traditions. Has a succession of gently accented hills and valleys (that of Pau river, which concentrates the capital, [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], and several cited as [[Orthez]] and [[Navarrenx]], being the most populated), it comprises the [[Aspe Valley|Aspe]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Bar\u00e9tous Valley|fr|3=Vall\u00e9e de Bar\u00e9tous|lt=Bar\u00e9tous}} and [[Ossau Valley|Ossau]] valleys with the [[Col du Soulor]]. Agriculture will always prominently, as viticulture (juran\u00e7on, Madiran) even if the aeronautical and petrochemical sectors are also represented. It was in B\u00e9arn that are concentrated the main ski resorts in the area, such {{Interlanguage link multi|Artouste|fr}}, [[Gourette]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Issarbe|fr}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|La Pierre Saint-Martin|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Le Somport|fr}}.\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Dune \u00e0 Boyardville.JPG|Sands dune in [[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron]] ([[Charente-Maritime]])\nFile:Baretous piemont Pyreneen.jpg|The {{Interlanguage link multi|Bar\u00e9tous Valley|fr|3=Vall\u00e9e de Bar\u00e9tous}} ([[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]])\nFile:Castelnaud-la-Chapelle 2 Stevage.jpg|Medieval city of [[Castelnaud-la-Chapelle]] ([[Dordogne]])\nFile:BordLac.jpg|The main lake of [[Biscarrosse]] (Landes)\nFile:2009 Aubusson Creuse France 3820681551.jpg|Old town of [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]] ([[Creuse]])\n</gallery>\n\n== Languages ==\nIn 2008, the region [[Aquitaine]] made a survey on the languages in the region, and gave the following results.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October\u2013November 2008|title=RESULTATS DE L\u2019ETUDE SOCIOLINGUISTIQUE : \"PRESENCE, PRATIQUES ET REPRESENTATIONS  DE LA LANGUE OCCITANE EN AQUITAINE\"|url=https://www.institut-bearnaisgascon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Avril_2009_Resultats_complets_enquete_sociolinguistique_occitan_en_Aquitaine-1.pdf|journal=Institut B\u00e9rnais et Guascon|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Languages in Aquitaine, 2008\n!Language\n!First languages\n!Total languages\n|-\n|French\n|86.1%\n|91.8%\n|-\n|English\n|8.7%\n|58.7%\n|-\n|Spanish\n|2.8%\n|44.1%\n|-\n|Occitan and other regional languages\n|0.6%\n|16.1%\n|-\n|German\n|0.4%\n|8.3%\n|-\n|Italian\n|0.3%\n|5.1%\n|-\n|Arabic\n|0.3%\n|2.9%\n|-\n|Basque\n|0.1%\n|1.7%\n|-\n|Other languages\n|0.7%\n|7.6%\n|-\n|Total\n|100.0%\n|236.3%\n|}\n\n== Climate ==\nThe region Nouvelle-Aquitaine essentially has a more or less altered [[oceanic climate]]. We distinguish the Aquitaine oceanic climate, which concerns most of the territory (Charentes to Landes), the Paris oceanic climate (Poitou), Limousin oceanic climate, tinged with semi-continental influences (Limousin) and basque microclimate, wetter (western half of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques and southern Landes). The Pyrenees has a specific climate that varies with altitude: the [[Pyrenean climate]], which is a variation of [[Alpine climate|mountain climate]].\n\n[[File:Une Vague - A wave.jpg|thumb|Wave at [[Saint-Cl\u00e9ment-des-Baleines]], on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]] ([[Charente-Maritime]]).]]\n\nIn the north of the region, the Paris oceanic climate is marked by moderate rainfall, warm summers and cool winters, but moderately so. The [[Seuil du Poitou]] acts as a relative climatic barrier and regions further south belong to the Aquitaine oceanic climate area. Coastal areas are wetter overall, with moderate rainfall spread throughout the year, except for the summer months, where droughts are not uncommon. Summer, which is relatively warm, is tempered by sea breezes, and winters are cool-mild. Frosts and snow are unusual. Sunshine is quite high, with around 2,000 to 2,200 hours per year, which is comparable to some Mediterranean regions ([[Perpignan]]). Summer precipitation often take the form of thunderstorms, possibly violent, while winter is sometimes marked by storms, some of which have marked the area with their exceptional: [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Martin]] in 1999 (record of 198&nbsp;km / h in [[Saint-Denis-d'Ol\u00e9ron]]), [[Cyclone Klaus|Klaus]] in 2009 (172&nbsp;km / h to [[Biscarrosse]]) and [[Cyclone Xynthia|Xynthia]] in 2010 (160&nbsp;km / h on the [[\u00cele de R\u00e9]]).\n\nThe climate in [[Angoumois]] and [[Limousin]] is wetter and cooler, remains temperate with warm spring and has relatively warm summers, with variations due to altitude. The annual sunshine averages at 1850 hours. The climate of the [[French Basque Country|Basque country]] and southern [[Landes (department)|Landes]] is marked by its warm summers, mild winters but especially by its high rainfall, with Atlantic depressions that hit the Pyrenean foothills. This Microclimate explains the presence of lush vegetation and the green aspect of the region. Fogs are not rare, but usually dissipate very quickly.\n\nAs for the Pyrenean climate, suboceanic trend [[B\u00e9arn]], it is subject to frequent \"cap effect\" when the north-west of disturbances abut against the Pyrenean mountains. Valley bottoms, true \"funnels clouds\" are particularly watered. The winter snow is important above 1200 meters. Pau valley has a microclimate, however, marked by strong sunlight (about 1900 hours a year) but high rainfall (1100&nbsp;mm per year) and a near absence of frost in winter. Rainfall is usually brief there, but regular, and spread throughout the year.\n\n== Transport ==\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine is a region of transit between the Paris Basin (including the Ile-de-France) and the Iberian Peninsula, but also between the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions (noon Toulouse). This situation implies several years developing roads and major highways, especially in the context of the road Estuaries, but also the high-speed Paris-Bordeaux-Toulouse-Spain, which should help significantly shorten rail journeys.\n\n=== Roads and highways ===\n\nMany roads and highways in the region radiate from [[Bordeaux]] and just attach to its peripheral belt (Bordeaux ring road or [[A630 autoroute|A630]]). The main lines used for reinforcing roads and highways are in addition some terminal bonds designed to streamline access to two major resorts in the area, [[Arcachon]] (via Highway A660) and [[Royan]] (by via the N150, partly making 2X2 routes).\n\n[[File:ringbordeaux.jpg|thumb|The ring road of [[Bordeaux]] supports a particularly heavy traffic.]]\n\nThe [[A10 autoroute]] (the \"Aquitaine\") is the major artery between Bordeaux and [[Paris]], commissioned in 1981. It is part of to the network of \"autoroutes du Sud de la France\" and provides access to several cities: [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], [[Niort]] or [[Poitiers]]. From Saintes, highway [[A837 autoroute|A837]] allows drivers to reach the town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Further north, in Niort, an interchange provides access to the [[A83 autoroute|A83]] motorway, the [[Vend\u00e9e]] and [[Nantes]] (Pays de la Loire). The N10 is the main road of the [[Charente]] and an important road for connecting between Bordeaux and Poitiers including [[Angoul\u00eame]].\n\nConnecting the east of Bordeaux ([[Libourne]]) to [[Lyon|Greater Lyon]], the [[A89 autoroute|A89]] motorway (called \"La transversale\") irrigates the eastern part of the region, facilitating travel between the cities of Bordeaux and [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], [[Tulle]] and [[Ussel, Lot|Ussel]]. A little further south, the D936, which roughly follows the course of the Dordogne, is grafted on the Bordeaux ring road via an interchange at the municipalities of [[Cenon]] and [[Floirac, Gironde|Floirac]]. It gives access to the towns of [[Branne, Gironde|Branne]], [[Castillon-la-Bataille]] and [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]] (Gironde) and [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]] (Dordogne).\n\nSoutheast of Bordeaux, an exchanger arranged at the ring road in the municipality of [[Gradignan]] allows access to the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], western part \"Entre-Deux-Mers\" motorway. Next a lateral axis at the Garonne, it can reach [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Marmande]], [[Agen]] and beyond, [[Toulouse]]. She just double the D10, on the right bank of the Garonne, which serves the southeast of the Gironde before heading down to the Landes. South of Langon, the [[A65 autoroute|A65]] motorway was commissioned in December 2010. Going through [[Bazas]], [[Mont-de-Marsan]] and [[Aire-sur-Adour]], she joined the [[Arrondissement of Pau|Greater Pau]] at [[Lescar]].\n\n[[File:Viaduc-du-chavanon cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The [[A89 autoroute|A89]] mark on the [[Chavanon Viaduct]] in [[Corr\u00e8ze]].]]\n\nSouthwest of Bordeaux, the [[A63 autoroute|A63]] is a major focus of the regional motorway network. Forming a large artery almost straight through the vast expanses of flat Landes de Gascogne, it crosses the south of Gironde and Landes (passes near [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] but avoids the prefecture, Mont-de-Marsan) before joining [[Bayonne]] and the Basque Country, to [[Irun]], on the Spanish border, the main border crossing. Particularly popular, especially during the summer, it supports an average daily traffic of 34,000 vehicles (8,000 trucks), increasing to 50,000 vehicles (10,000 trucks) during the months of summer. The other border crossings, less frequented but less direct, are the Somport tunnel and Col du Pourtalet.\n\nThe Basque country and B\u00e9arn are also served by a road parallel to the Pyrenees, which facilitates access to Toulouse and the Mediterranean regions: the [[A64 autoroute|A64]], called \"La Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9enne\". It starts from [[Briscous]] (in the outskirts of Bayonne), continues to [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] before reaching [[Tarbes]] in the neighbouring region of [[Occitanie]]) and the Toulouse ring road.\n\nThe eastern region is well served by the [[A20 autoroute|A20]] north-south axis between Paris and Toulouse and opens up Limousin. It thus goes through [[La Souterraine]], [[Limoges]] and [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]. Another important way, the European route E603 connects [[Limoges]] to [[Angoul\u00eame]] and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]]. It represents one of the key elements of the road Central Europe Atlantic important channel of communication between the Rh\u00f4ne Valley and the Atlantic coast, which is divided into multiple plots at Angoul\u00eame and Saintes (Bordeaux, Royan and La Rochelle).\n\n=== Rail network ===\n\nThe regional rail network is organised around the main towns: [[Bordeaux]], [[Limoges]], [[Poitiers]], [[La Rochelle]] and [[Bayonne]]. The main line is the one between [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] via Poitiers, Bordeaux and [[Hendaye]]; then comes the line [[Lille]]-[[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], which serves [[Limoges]], both served by [[TGV]] trains. Other lines are served mostly by the [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] network of [[TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine]].\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R03.jpg|thumb|With 10 million passengers a year, the [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]] station is the largest station in the region.]]\n\nThe largest station in the region is [[Gare de Bordeaux-Saint-Jean|Bordeaux-Saint-Jean]], which accommodates 10 million passengers per year; then comes the [[Gare de Limoges-B\u00e9n\u00e9dictins|Limoges-B\u00e9n\u00e9dictins]] station and its 2.5 million passengers. Poitiers has two stations: [[Gare de Poitiers|Poitiers]] station and [[Gare du Futuroscope|Futuroscope]] station serving the technology park [[Futuroscope]]. [[Gare d'Angoul\u00eame|Angoul\u00eame]] station sees around 1.45 million passengers per year; [[Gare d'Agen|Agen]] station links the [[Occitanie]] region and hosts more than 1.3 million passengers per year; [[Gare de Pau|Pau]] station sees nearly 1 million passengers each year while the number of users of [[Gare de Dax|Dax]] station reached 820,000.\n\nThe implementation of the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]], which is part of a priority program initiated by the state, should facilitate trade. The journey time between Bordeaux and Paris ([[Gare Montparnasse|Montparnasse]]) is expected to reduce from three hours in 2015 to just over two hours in 2017. At the same time, the journey time between Poitiers and Paris should reduce from 1:30 to 1:15, between Angoul\u00eame and Paris from a little over two hours to 1:40 and between La Rochelle and Paris from just under three hours to 2:30. Journey times between several cities in the region will also be shortened, between Bordeaux and Angoul\u00eame reducing from just under an hour to a little over half an hour, and between Bordeaux and Poitiers reducing to approximately half-an-hour.\n\nAnother important project for the region, the [[LGV Bordeaux - Spain]] extends of the South Europe Atlantic TGV line to connect with the [[Basque Y]] (high-speed line linking the Spanish cities of [[Bilbao]], [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] and [[Irun]]). It is part of the great South West Rail project and should facilitate regional connections between Bordeaux, Mont-de-Marsan, Dax and Bayonne, long distance connections between the south of the region and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], and also international links to [[Spain]] (including Madrid).\n\nThe LGV Bar project between Poitiers - Limoges is part of this context, and should significantly shorten travel between the two cities (from just over an hour and a half to 45 minutes), facilitate interregional connections and access to the Ile-de-France. This project is one of the links of \"Transline project\" (Transversal Auvergne Atlantic Alpes), still under study.\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nThe region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport|Bordeaux-Merignac]], world class, which hosts nearly four and a half million passengers per year and offers flights to many destinations; It is the seventh metropolitan France Airport (fifth if we except the Paris airports).\n\n[[File:Biarritz A\u00e9roport (1).jpg|thumb|The terminal of the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne Airport, which has the second greatest attendance in the region.]]\n\nThe second airport is [[Biarritz \u2013 Anglet \u2013 Bayonne Airport|Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne]], which offers flights to several European countries and hosts a little over a million passengers; it ranks in 17th position at Metropolitan France. Third airport in the region, [[Pau Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport]] welcomes approximately 650,000 passengers per year. Then the airport of [[Limoges \u2013 Bellegarde Airport|Limoges-Bellegarde]], hosting nearly 300,000 passengers per year and [[Bergerac Dordogne P\u00e9rigord Airport]], created in 1990 and whose attendance has increased from 16,000 passengers a year in 2002 to 260,000 in 2010.\n\nThe [[La Rochelle \u2013 \u00cele de R\u00e9 Airport|airport of La Rochelle - \u00cele de R\u00e9]] offers flights to several French and European cities and welcomes approximately 215,000 passengers per year. Smaller, airports [[Poitiers\u2013Biard Airport|Poitiers-Biard]] (100,000 annual passengers), [[Brive\u2013Souillac Airport|Brive Dordogne]] (60,000 passengers), [[Agen La Garenne Airport|Agen-La Garenne]] (40,000 passengers) and [[P\u00e9rigueux Bassillac Airport|P\u00e9rigueux-Bassillac]] (8000 passengers) offer mainly domestic flights. Airports [[Angoul\u00eame \u2013 Cognac International Airport|Angoul\u00eame-Cognac]] and [[Rochefort \u2013 Charente-Maritime Airport|Rochefort-Charente-Maritime]] are only turned to business flights in the absence of regular commercial lines.\n\n=== Harbours ===\n\nCruise ships mostly dock in the ports of La Rochelle (terminal [[La Pallice]]), Verdon-sur-Mer (shuttles for [[Royan]]), [[Pauillac]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Bayonne]].\n\n[[File:Port de Royan de Nuit (2).jpg|thumb|[[Royan]] harbour by night.]]\n\nMany marinas are open to smaller boats. The main ones are those of [[La Rochelle]] (4800 rings), [[Arcachon]] (2600 rings), [[Port-M\u00e9doc]] (1200 rings), [[Royan]] (1000 rings), of [[Capbreton]] (950 rings), [[Hendaye]] (800 rings), [[Saint-Denis-d'Ol\u00e9ron]] (750 rings) and [[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] (425 rings).\n\nRiver transport is active on several rivers in the region: [[Charente (river)|Charente]] (mainly between [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Angoul\u00eame]]), [[Gironde estuary]], [[Garonne]], [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]], [[Lot (river)|Lot]], [[Baise]] and [[Adour]].\n\nLandmark river tourism, the Canal de Garonne is an extension of the [[Canal du Midi]] (which together form the \"Canal des Deux-Mers\" between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean). It passes including [[Agen]] (Agen aqueduct) and continues until [[Castets-en-Dorthe]] (Gironde).\n\nThe entire watershed of the Dordogne is classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 11 July 2012 with the co-ordination structure Institution of regional public Dordogne basin. The basin of the Dordogne is one of the few places in France where the presence of eight migratory fish species proved with Atlantic salmon, sea trout, river lamprey, sea lamprey, Allis shad, shad feigned, eel, and sturgeon in Europe. Other species associated with water, such as the common otter and the European mink, or the penny whistle swimming, are also present.\n\nTwo water agencies (Adour-Garonne and Loire-Bretagne) are involved in water management in the region.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 177.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.5% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,500 euros or 88% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 101% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe economy of the region is based on several pillars: diversified [[agriculture]], a set of famous vineyards ([[Bordeaux wine]], brandies of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]]), but also a decisive role in the industry sectors [[aerospace]], defence, [[biotechnology]], [[chemistry]] and more generally for [[scientific research]], relying on a network of universities and [[Grandes Ecoles]].\n\n[[File:Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck R02.jpg|thumb|The business district of [[M\u00e9riadeck]] at [[Bordeaux]], remained on a human scale.]]\n\nNouvelle-Aquitaine can also count on a large image and digital sector (\"Campus de l'Image\" of [[Angoul\u00eame]], future \"Cit\u00e9 Num\u00e9rique\" of [[B\u00e8gles]]), a dense network of small and medium enterprises, the presence in its territory of large [[agribusiness]] as well as a port network including three major commercial ports being balanced due to their geographical position ([[La Pallice|Grand Port maritime de La Rochelle]] in the north, [[Port of Bordeaux|Grand Port maritime de Bordeaux]] and [[port of Bayonne]] in the south). In 2013, a survey conducted by the weekly \"[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]\" classed Bordeaux as second best of most French cities \"business friendly\" in the category of cities with over 500,000 inhabitants (and the best economic environment), [[Poitiers]], [[La Rochelle]] and [[Bayonne]] respectively in second, third and fourth in population centers from 100,000 to 200,000 inhabitants. In 2014, a new survey, conducted this time by the \"Great Place To Work\" Institute, gives Bordeaux as a city considered the most attractive by salaried workers.\n\nThe new area boasts natural and heritage assets that make it a tourist destination of foreground, materialised by a wide ocean frontage structured around three major resorts \"historical\" ([[Arcachon]], [[Biarritz]] and [[Royan]]), a series of winter sports stations in the heart of the Pyrenean massif ([[Gourette]], [[Le Somport]]) and leading historical sites ([[Lascaux]] caves, medieval city - and \"wine Mecca\" - of [[Saint-\u00c9milion]], martyr village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]) visited by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\n=== Agricultural and wine sectors ===\nAn important rural Region, Nouvelle-Aquitaine has a varied agriculture. Cattle breeding (regional races: [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin]], Bordelais, [[Parthenais]], [[Blonde d'Aquitaine]], Gasconne, [[Bazadais]] and B\u00e9arnais) is predominant in the Bressuirais and Confolentais grove and in the Aunisienne plain, on the high Limousin plateau, in the Bazadaises and Chalossiennes Hills and is used both in the production of meat to milk production. There are also two other bovine regional breeds do not belong to the list of official French breeds (Marinelandaise and Betizu) endangered. The area has many quality labels (\"Veau fermier \u00e9lev\u00e9 sous la m\u00e8re\", Limousin beef ...).\n\n[[File:Blonde Aquitaine.jpg|thumb|[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]] in the [[Pyrenees]].]]\n\nGoats (regional breeds: Poitevine, Pyrenees and Massif Central) are mainly concentrated in the north of the region (Charente, Charente-Maritime, Deux-S\u00e8vres and Vienne) and are used for cheese production ([[chabichou]], [[Mothais sur feuille]], \"Jonch\u00e9e\"). These four departments alone account for 30% of French goat herd, more than 200,000 heads. Some departments complement this area (Corr\u00e8ze and Dordogne with a part of the production  of [[Rocamadour cheese|Rocamadour]] [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]]). Sheep farming (regional races: Basque-b\u00e9arnaise, Landes, limousine, manech black head, red head and Xaxi Ardia) is well represented in the Limousin (Limousin lamb) the Charentes (lamb Poitou-Charentes), the M\u00e9doc (Pauillac lamb) and the Basque and Bearn Pyrenees.\n\nPig farming, which represents a significant part of the agri-food sector is distributed throughout the region (regional races: black ass Limousin, Gascon pork pie black Basque) and is guaranteed by the label \"porc du Sud-Ouest \". The pigs in the region are used to produce many meat products, starting with the famous Bayonne ham. Many farms have also specialised in poultry production including yellow chicken Saint-Sever and poultry of S\u00e8vres val (regional races Barbezieux, Limousin, Gascony, Landes and Marans) and fat waterfowl (mule ducks and geese), primarily designed for the production of foie gras and confit. Nouvelle-Aquitaine is the first European region for foie gras (more than half the French production). The label \"Canard \u00e0 foie gras du Sud-Ouest\" occupies a large part of the region.\n\nThe region is the birthplace of many other breeds (regional donkey breeds: the Pyrenees and Poitou, regional equine: Poitevin mule, Landais and Pottock).\n\nThe area is also an important oyster production center, with oysters \" de Claires\" from [[Marennes, Charente-Maritime|Marennes]]-[[\u00cele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]] (in the estuary of the [[Seudre]]) and those of [[Arcachon]] and [[Cap Ferret]] and a stronghold of the mussel with mussels from Aiguillon Bay (near [[La Rochelle]]) and mussel Boyardville and [[Port-des-Barques]].\n\nThe decrease in fishery resources has led to a drop in tonnage of fish in the main ports of the region, however, remain very active. In 2014, the first port in the region (port and eighth highest tonnage nationally) is that of [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]-[[Ciboure]], or share about 7600 tons of fish, and annual business 23 million euros. This is followed by the port of [[Saint-Pierre-d'Ol\u00e9ron|La Cotini\u00e8re]] on Oleron island, sixth French fishing port for sales specialising in species 'nobles' (5300 tons of fish landed). Then there are the ports of [[La Rochelle]], [[Royan]], [[Arcachon]], [[Capbreton]] and [[Hendaye]].\n\n[[File:Remy Martin XO - Louis XIII - Hennessy Paradis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cognac]], one of two regional famous brandies with [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]].]]\n\n[[Viticulture]] is a key sector of the local economy, the region with the presence of some of the most prestigious French vineyards: vineyards of Bordeaux, Bergerac, Cognac (production of [[Cognac]] and [[Pineau des Charentes]]) and partially, Armagnac (production of [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]] and [[Floc de Gascogne]]), Southwest vineyards in the valleys of the Garonne and Lot, vineyard slopes of the Pyrenees ([[juran\u00e7on]], [[iroul\u00e9guy]]) and vineyards of Haut-Poitou. The vineyards of the Limousin, formerly prolific now confidential, but continues to provide quality wines (vineyards [[Verneuil-sur-Vienne]] and Correze vineyard, including giving the wine country and the Correze \"vin paill\u00e9\" of [[Queyssac-les-Vignes]]).\n\nThe region plays a vital role for cereal crops (wheat), herbage and oil (corn, sunflower), which bloom in the valleys of the Adour, Charente and the Garonne. Large agricultural cooperatives are located in the area: Lur Berri, Ma\u00efsadour, or Natea Charentes Alliance. In Charente-Maritime, the small town of [[Saint-Genis-de-Saintonge]] developed the largest French [[popcorn]] production unit: 70% of the national production comes out of his ateliers.\n\n[[Tobacco]] production remains important in [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]] area around [[La R\u00e9ole]], [[Auros]], [[Mons\u00e9gur, Gironde|Mons\u00e9gur]] and [[Bazas]] (Gironde) in [[Bergerac, Dordogne|Bergerac]], in Dordogne and in the Lot-et-Garonne, which occurred to him only 14% of the French Tobacco nearly 800 hectares. Mixed farming has led to the establishment of more localised cultures, but nevertheless considered: P\u00e9rigord walnuts, Limousin apples, strawberries valleys of the Dordogne and Lot, Charentais melons hillsides, beans (\"mojhettes\") of val d'Arnoult and the Marais Poitevin, the [[Marmande]] tomatoes, peppers from Landes and the Basque Country, the most famous representative is the [[Espelette pepper]].\n\nThe agri-food sector is characterised by the presence of several national brands and international production sites, including [[Madrange]] ([[Limoges]]), [[Bl\u00e9dina]] ([[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]), Marie ([[Airvault]] and [[Mirebeau]]) [[Senoble]] ([[Aytr\u00e9]], near [[La Rochelle]] ), [[Lu, Cestas|Lu]] ([[Cestas]], near [[Bordeaux]]) [[C\u00e9moi]] ([[B\u00e8gles]], near [[Bordeaux]]), [[Charal]] ([[\u00c9gletons]], in Corr\u00e8ze), Valade Group ([[Lubersac]], in Corr\u00e8ze) or [[Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli]] ([[Oloron-Sainte-Marie]]). [[Labeyrie, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Labeyrie]] headquartered in [[Came]] in the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] and [[Delpeyrat]] in [[Mont-de-Marsan]], in the Landes.\n\n=== Forest resources ===\n\nThe region has significant forest resources.\n\nThe timber industry consists of two main types of activities that mainly use the wood of the Landes forest and secondarily of the Dordogne, Creuse, Corr\u00e8ze and Haute-Vienne. The primary processing industries (pulp, sawing, slicing, etc.) are very often the result of large companies to perform operations that require large investments. The secondary processing industries (paper / cardboard, furniture, woodwork and plywood, etc.) do not require as many resources. They are more dispersed geographically and in the hands of smaller-scale undertakings or craft.\n\nThe timber industry is large enough to get the support of local authorities throughout the years. Thus is explained obtaining national competitiveness cluster label for the \"Xylofutur\" whose main purpose is to bring innovative projects to benefit the entire industry. Directly related to the timber industry, the Charente stationery has adapted to globalisation by producing special paper (paper packaging, greaseproof paper, recycled paper and corrugated cardboard).\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nThe region is a major international center in the field of aeronautics and space industry. Together with the neighbouring region [[Occitanie]], it belongs to the [[Aerospace Valley]] world-class industry cluster. The regional aerospace sector is closely linked to the defence sector, leading to talk of industry \"ASD\" (aeronautics, space and defence).\n\nThe regional [[aircraft industry]] is a world leader for business aircraft, high-tech batteries, high performance composite materials, landing gear systems and turbines for helicopters, the European leader for military aircraft, cockpit equipment and systems, ground tests and flight, launchers, solid propulsion, airborne radars and systems, weapons systems deterrence, atmospheric re-entry technology and national leader in the interior design of 'business aircraft, aircraft maintenance, UAV systems.\n\n[[File:Rafale 070412-N-8157C-542.JPEG|thumb|Many \"[[Dassault Rafale|Rafales]]\" are assembled in [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]], in the [[Bordeaux]] metropolis.]]\n\nThe main sites are located in the city of Bordeaux, but also in the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] and in [[Vienne]]. Of these, [[Dassault Aviation]] has five establishments in M\u00e9rignac (final assembly and commissioning flight Rafale and Falcon), [[Martignas-sur-Jalle]] (wing civilian and military aircraft), Biarritz (composites and assembly of structures), [[Cazaux]] (integration and armament test) and Poitiers (production of military aircraft canopy). [[Thales Group]] has two sites near Bordeaux: Pessac (aircraft embedded systems: mission computers, airborne radars combat and surveillance, unmanned aerial systems) and Hailsham (design and development of cockpit systems for major aircraft manufacturers in the world ). [[Airbus Defence and Space]] (development and production of [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] launchers and of ballistic missiles for the [[Force de dissuasion|French nuclear force]]) is located in [[Saint-M\u00e9dard-en-Jalles]]. [[Safran]] has two major production facilities in the region: Turbomeca (world leader in helicopter turbines) near Pau and Snecma (maintenance and repair of military engines) in [[Ch\u00e2tellerault]].\n\nThe region is also home to several military airbases, including a command center of the [[French Air Force]]. It also hosts major defence-related facilities such as the [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule|Megajoule laser]] and the main [[DGA Essais de missiles|rocket testing facility]] of the [[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'armement]].\n\n[[File:Turbom\u00e9ca Arriel cutaway.jpg|thumb|left|The Turbomeca Arriel [[turboshaft]] engine, manufactured in [[Bordes, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Bordes]] (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques).]]\n\nThe pharmaceutical and parachemical industry is particularly well represented in the city of Bordeaux: [[Sanofi]] has three sites on the outskirts of Bordeaux, [[Ambar\u00e8s-et-Lagrave]] (production) [[Floirac, Gironde|Floirac]] (IT) and [[Saint-Loub\u00e8s]] (logistics); Meda Pharma Group is located in M\u00e9rignac; The Merck Group operates a production unit in [[Martillac]]. Finally, CEVA Animal Health in [[Libourne]], with more than 500 employees, originally created by Sanofi, now owned by its employees, is (in the company) the ninth largest veterinary pharmaceutical group.\n\nIn [[Agen]], the UPSA Company (scientific pharmacology Union applied), sold to the US group Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 1994, remains one of the biggest local and regional employers with 1,400 employees. Two factories and a logistics platform allow the market to deliver the full range of analgesics from aspirin and paracetamol to morphine. Since 1994, the US group has invested regularly in its two Agenais units that deliver half of their export production.\n\n[[Limoges]], long specialised in manufacturing and luxury (shoes, porcelain ...), is now a major cluster in the field of ceramics research (European Ceramics Pole). Legrand, French industrial group historically based in Limoges in the Limousin, is a world leader in products and systems for electrical installations and information networks. Ester Technology Park, is a business and research center that develops north of the city on several areas: ceramics; materials and surface treatments; electronics, optics and telecommunications; Health biotechnology; water and environment; Engineering in association with the [[University of Limoges]].\n\n[[Niort]] has developed over many years a financial sector based economy (insurance), and has now the fourth greatest number of flows in the French financial market (behind [[Paris]], [[Lyon]] and [[Lille]]). Headquarters of many [[mutual fund]]s, including the \"Three M\" ([[Macif]], [[Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund|MAIF]] and Maaf), the city is also seventh in regard to senior positions. The share of the financial activities sector jobs and insurance is far more important than in the rest of the country, reaching 18% in the urban area of Niort (against 3.7% in the rest of France).\n\nThe oil and gas industry is also represented in the region, with the [[Lacq gas field]] near Pau, which was France's main source of natural gas in the 1970s.\n\n=== Tourism ===\nTourism is an important sector in a region with significant assets, starting with a mild and sunny climate, famous vineyards (wine tourism) and many heritage sites, some of international renown. Its wide ocean frontage, stormed by thousands of vacationers - and surfers - every summer is characterised by sandy beaches that often stretch to the horizon. Indirect consequence of increasingly popular for water sports, many surf-related brands (mainly clothing and equipment) are present in the region, earning him the nickname \"Glissicon Valley\" in reference to [[Silicon Valley]]: [[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], [[Quiksilver]], [[O'Neill (brand)|O'Neill]]\u2026\n\n[[File:Surf Lacanau.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Surf culture]]\" very present on the coast - here in Lacanau \u2013 is the reason of the establishment in the area of brands related to this sector ([[Rip Curl]], [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]]...)]]\n\nIn the northern part of the coast, the Charente archipelago consists mainly islands of [[\u00eele de R\u00e9|R\u00e9]], [[\u00eele d'Ol\u00e9ron|Ol\u00e9ron]] and [[\u00eele d'Aix|Aix]], where alternate sheltered coves and beaches opening onto the open sea. The aunisiennes coast, near [[La Rochelle]], greet some family seaside resorts such as [[Ch\u00e2telaillon-Plage]] or [[Fouras]]. Further south, in the heart of the C\u00f4te de Beaut\u00e9 (Coast of Beauty), [[Royan]] is one of three major seaside resorts in the region. She has five beaches, not to mention those of neighbouring towns and the C\u00f4te Sauvage (Wild Coast) of the peninsula of Arvert, Mecca of surfing and board sports.\n\nBeyond the Gironde estuary begins the C\u00f4te d\u2019Argent (Silver Coast), large expanse of almost straight sand bordered by pine trees and large lakes Landes, punctuated by small resorts such as [[Soulac-sur-Mer]], [[Vendays-Montalivet]] (famous for its naturist center) [[Hourtin]], [[Lacanau]], [[Biscarrosse]], [[Mimizan]], [[Hossegor]] or [[Capbreton]]. The [[Bassin d'Arcachon]], which forms an indentation between Gironde and Landes coast, focuses on [[Arcachon]], another seaside resort, nestled in the heart of the pine forest. It faces the [[Cap Ferret]], beaten by the waves of the ocean. In continuation of the C\u00f4te d'Argent, the Basque coast is structured around [[Biarritz]], Mecca of seaside tourism, [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and [[Hendaye]], and is famous for its eroded cliffs and powerful rollers which make it a favourite spot for surfers.\n\nWinter sports enthusiasts are in the Pyrenean several stations where to practice skiing, snowboarding and snowblade. The main ones are [[Gourette]], [[Artouste]], [[La Pierre Saint-Martin]], [[Issarbe]], [[Le Somport]], [[Iraty]] or [[Somport-Candanchu]].\n\nMany spas are located in the region, starting with [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], but also [[Eaux-Bonnes]], [[Eug\u00e9nie-les-Bains]], [[Saint-Paul-l\u00e8s-Dax]], [[Salies-de-B\u00e9arn]], [[Cambo-les-Bains]], [[Jonzac]], [[Saujon]], [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], [[La Roche-Posay]] or [[\u00c9vaux-les-Bains]].\n\nAmong the other sites with large numbers of visitors, many have higher attendance than one million people a year: the park [[Futuroscope]] in [[Poitiers]] (1.8 million visitors), the most visited site outside the \u00cele de-France, the old town of [[Sarlat-la-Can\u00e9da|Sarlat]] (1.5 million visitors), [[Dune du Pilat]], near [[Arcachon]], (1.4 million visitors), or the historic town of [[Saint-Emilion]], near [[Libourne]] ( about 1 million visitors).\n\n[[Aquarium de La Rochelle]] approach (850,000 visitors), as well as the [[La Palmyre Zoo]] (700,000 visitors), the largest private zoo in Europe, near [[Royan]]. The medieval village of [[Collonges-la-Rouge]] (500,000 visitors), the Southwest [[Walibi]] theme park in [[Roquefort, Lot-et-Garonne|Roquefort]], near [[Agen]] (300,000 visitors), the small train of Rhune near Bayonne (about 360,000 visitors), the center of memory and martyr village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], near [[Limoges]] (300,000 visitors), the caves of [[Lascaux]] - Lascaux 2 and 3 (250,000 visitors), the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es National Park]] (200,000 visitors), the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Ecrit of [[Montmorillon]] (110,000 visitors), the Centre international de la mer of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], Chassiron lighthouses on the island of Oleron, and phare des Baleines, on the R\u00e9 island (about 100,000 visitors each), or the animal park Mountains [[Gu\u00e9ret]], Creuse, website to observe wolves in parole and attracting about 45,000 visitors a year, are all leading sites in regard to tourism.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aquitaine]]\n* [[Limousin]]\n* [[Occitania]]\n* [[Poitou-Charentes]]\n* [[Poitou]]\n* [[Regions of France]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n* {{Official website}} {{in lang|fr}}\n*[http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/aquitaine/2014/12/17/la-region-aquitaine-limousin-poitou-charente-definitivement-adoptee-615440.html Merger of the regions - France 3]\n\n{{Regions of France|current}}\n\n[[Category:Nouvelle-Aquitaine| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of France]]\n", "name_user": "AmazingJus", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle-Aquitaine"}

It enters the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] via the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] between [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Clarksville, Indiana]]. The {{convert| 266.02 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;31 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]]. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four- or six-lane divided expressway. The northernmost community along the highway is [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] near the [[Michigan]] state line.\n\nUS&nbsp;31 was first designated as a US Highway in October 1926. A northern section (from Rochester to South Bend) and a far southern section (on old US&nbsp;31 W into Louisville on the K&I Bridge) of the highway originally served as part of the [[Dixie Highway]]. US&nbsp;31 was the Jackson Highway from Indianapolis to Seymour. US&nbsp;31 replaced the original State Road 1 (SR&nbsp;1) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR&nbsp;1 ran from Clarksville through [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] to South Bend and ended at the Michigan state line.\n\n==Route description==\nOnly the segment of US&nbsp;31 that is north of Indianapolis is included as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).<ref name=\"NHS Map of Indiana\">{{cite map |title = National Highway System: Indiana |date = December 2003 |author = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/in/in_Indiana.pdf |format = PDF |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name=NHS>{{FHWA NHS |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The highway is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state.

This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,690&nbsp;personal vehicles and 160&nbsp;commercial vehicles that used the highway daily near [[Memphis, Indiana|Memphis]]. The peak traffic volume was 168,770&nbsp;personal vehicles and 18,090&nbsp;commercial vehicles along the section of US&nbsp;31 concurrent with [[Interstate 465 in Indiana|Interstate 465]] (I\u2013465).<ref name=\"AADT\">{{cite web |url = http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |title = INDOT Traffic Zones |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = 2010 |accessdate = July 9, 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505203005/http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |archivedate = May 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Jeffersonville to Columbus===\nUS&nbsp;31 overlaps I-65 in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], after crossing the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] from Kentucky.  It then diverges as the access frontage lanes before splitting off north of Jeffersonville at [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and proceeding to [[Indianapolis]].  US&nbsp;31 was widened to two lanes in both directions for its length through Columbus in the early 2000s.\n\n===Columbus to Indianapolis===\nAt I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US&nbsp;31 is routed onto I-465 on the east side of the city. This is the closest approach the highway makes to downtown Indianapolis. Previously the northbound route of the highway through Indianapolis was on East Street, Madison Avenue, Delaware Street, North Street, and onto Meridian Street; southbound was on Meridian Street, North Street, Pennsylvania Street, Madison Avenue, and onto East Street.\n\n===Indianapolis to Michigan===\nUS&nbsp;31 exits I-465 (coincidentally at exit 31) in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], and continues northward as a [[freeway]] through [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]]. North of [[Indiana State Road 38|SR&nbsp;38]], it reverts to a [[divided highway]] until reaching the [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] area, where it again becomes a full freeway to bypass that city to the east. North of the Kokomo area US&nbsp;31 again becomes a rural divided highway, which skirts [[Peru, Indiana|Peru]], [[Rochester, Indiana|Rochester]], and [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]]. At [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]] east of Plymouth, US&nbsp;31 becomes a freeway again and remains so for the rest of its journey in the state. After bypassing [[Lakeville, Indiana|Lakeville]] to the east, US&nbsp;31 approaches [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]].

It enters the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] via the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] between [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Clarksville, Indiana]]. The {{convert| 266.02 |mi|km|2}} of US&nbsp;31 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]]. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four- or six-lane divided expressway. The northernmost community along the highway is [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] near the [[Michigan]] state line.\n\nUS&nbsp;31 was first designated as a US Highway in October 1926. A northern section (from Rochester to South Bend) and a far southern section (on old US&nbsp;31 W into Louisville on the K&I Bridge) of the highway originally served as part of the [[Dixie Highway]]. US&nbsp;31 was the Jackson Highway from Indianapolis to Seymour. US&nbsp;31 replaced the original State Road 1 (SR&nbsp;1) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR&nbsp;1 ran from Clarksville through [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] to South Bend and ended at the Michigan state line.\n\n==Route description==\nOnly the segment of US&nbsp;31 that is north of Indianapolis is included as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS).<ref name=\"NHS Map of Indiana\">{{cite map |title = National Highway System: Indiana |date = December 2003 |author = [[Federal Highway Administration]] |url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/in/in_Indiana.pdf |format = PDF |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name=NHS>{{FHWA NHS |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref>  The highway is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,690&nbsp;personal vehicles and 160&nbsp;commercial vehicles that used the highway daily near [[Memphis, Indiana|Memphis]]. The peak traffic volume was 168,770&nbsp;personal vehicles and 18,090&nbsp;commercial vehicles along the section of US&nbsp;31 concurrent with [[Interstate 465 in Indiana|Interstate 465]] (I\u2013465).<ref name=\"AADT\">{{cite web |url = http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |title = INDOT Traffic Zones |publisher = Indiana Department of Transportation |date = 2010 |accessdate = July 9, 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505203005/http://dotmaps.indot.in.gov/apps/trafficcounts/ |archivedate = May 5, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Jeffersonville to Columbus===\nUS&nbsp;31 overlaps I-65 in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], after crossing the [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] from Kentucky.  It then diverges as the access frontage lanes before splitting off north of Jeffersonville at [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and proceeding to [[Indianapolis]].  US&nbsp;31 was widened to two lanes in both directions for its length through Columbus in the early 2000s.\n\n===Columbus to Indianapolis===\nAt I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US&nbsp;31 is routed onto I-465 on the east side of the city. This is the closest approach the highway makes to downtown Indianapolis. Previously the northbound route of the highway through Indianapolis was on East Street, Madison Avenue, Delaware Street, North Street, and onto Meridian Street; southbound was on Meridian Street, North Street, Pennsylvania Street, Madison Avenue, and onto East Street.\n\n===Indianapolis to Michigan===\nUS&nbsp;31 exits I-465 (coincidentally at exit 31) in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], and continues northward as a [[freeway]] through [[Westfield, Indiana|Westfield]]. North of [[Indiana State Road 38|SR&nbsp;38]], it reverts to a [[divided highway]] until reaching the [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] area, where it again becomes a full freeway to bypass that city to the east. North of the Kokomo area US&nbsp;31 again becomes a rural divided highway, which skirts [[Peru, Indiana|Peru]], [[Rochester, Indiana|Rochester]], and [[Plymouth, Indiana|Plymouth]]. At [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]] east of Plymouth, US&nbsp;31 becomes a freeway again and remains so for the rest of its journey in the state. After bypassing [[Lakeville, Indiana|Lakeville]] to the east, US&nbsp;31 approaches [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]]. There the route converges with [[U.S. Route 20 in Indiana|US&nbsp;20]] ([[St. Joseph Valley Parkway]]) and proceeds west and then north to bypass South Bend. After US&nbsp;20 splits off to the west near [[South Bend International Airport|the South Bend Airport]], US&nbsp;31 has an interchange with the [[Indiana Toll Road]] ([[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]]) before proceeding north into [[Michigan]].\n\n==History==\nUS&nbsp;31 was signed into law by the Governor on March 7, 1917, as Main Market Highway&nbsp;1, and signs were installed on June 1 of that year.<ref name=\"Main Market Highways\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = 1917 Indiana State Highway Map and State Highway Commission |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref><ref name=\"INDOT 1917\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1917.jpg |author = Indiana State Highway Commission  |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1917 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> The name was changed to State Road&nbsp;1 within a year when Indiana began the state road system.<ref name=\"INDOT 1917\" /><ref name=\"INDOT 1918\">{{cite map |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1918 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission }}</ref> By 1924, most of the route was paved, leaving only from Columbus to Franklin and from Peru to Plymouth that was unpaved.<ref name=\"INDOT 1924\">{{cite map |url = http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gm-web/imdb/inhwy1924.pdf  |author = Indiana State Highway Commission |title = Indiana Transportation Map |year = 1924 |scale = Scale not given |location = Indianapolis |publisher = Indiana State Highway Commission |access-date = July 20, 2012 }}</ref> On October 1, 1926, US&nbsp;31 was designated along what was SR&nbsp;1 at the time.<ref name=\"increated\" />\n\nIn the late 2000s, INDOT began a process of converting US&nbsp;31 to [[Interstate Highway standards]] from [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] to [[Indianapolis]].

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The foundation columns were placed as close to the subway tunnel as possible, in order to reduce the length of the trusses, which would have had to carry heavy loads. All of the foundation columns were sunk to the depth of the rock underneath.<ref name=\"AR pp. 21\" />\n\nA [[cofferdam]] was then built on the eastern border of the site, and on part of the northern border. The rock surface underneath the building site was closer to the ground on the western side of the lot, requiring extensive excavation. On the eastern side of the lot, the rock surface sloped below the elevation of the subway tunnel. A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} wall was built on the southern boundary of the Cunard lot, of which a {{Convert|2|ft||adj=on}} width was located under the Bowling Green Offices Building.

The columns of windows around the central pavilion, which is recessed further, are also set within a rusticated facade. The outer pavilions are set back beyond the 18th story to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The central pavilion contains a loggia between the 19th and 21st stories, also supported by Tuscan-style column pairs, and includes a [[mansard roof]] above the 22nd story.

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth, transmitting the virus to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.

Science, technology, forestry and business have been added to the numerous engineering disciplines, and Michigan Tech now offers more than 130&nbsp;degree programs through its five colleges and schools.\n\nMichigan Tech's athletic teams are nicknamed the [[Michigan Tech Huskies|Huskies]] and compete primarily in the [[NCAA Division II]] [[Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (GLIAC). The men's [[College ice hockey|hockey]] team competes in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] as a member of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA), and [[List of NCAA Division I men's ice hockey champions|has won three national championships]].

McNair (1899\u20131924) was the college's second president. By 1931, enrollment had reached nearly 600. Over the next few years, due to the Great Depression, money was scarce, causing department heads and even the president of the university, [[William O. Hotchkiss]], to take pay cuts.\n\nUnder President Grover C. Dillman (1935\u20131956), the school underwent many notable changes, including the construction of the Memorial Union Building, the purchasing an ice rink and a golf course as well as the procurement of the village of [[Alberta, Michigan]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1956, J.

The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons, according to Van Pelt. First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title.

McNair (1899\u20131924) was the college's second president. By 1931, enrollment had reached nearly 600. Over the next few years, due to the Great Depression, money was scarce, causing department heads and even the president of the university, [[William O. Hotchkiss]], to take pay cuts.\n\nUnder President Grover C. Dillman (1935\u20131956), the school underwent many notable changes, including the construction of the Memorial Union Building, the purchasing an ice rink and a golf course as well as the procurement of the village of [[Alberta, Michigan]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1956, J.

This included the school's first analog computation class in 1956\u201357.<ref>{{cite document|last=Waltman|first=Gene L.|title=Black Magic and Gremlins: Analog Flight Simulations at NASA's Flight Research Center|work=NASA SP-2000-4520|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|hdl=2060/20010011952}}</ref>\n\nIn the final years of his presidency, the school changed from a college to a university, changing its name a final time to '''Michigan Technological University'''. The change from the Michigan College of Mining and Technology was necessary for two reasons, according to Van Pelt. First, the college had expanded too greatly and the current name was no longer an accurate title.

He found popular success with plays and stories written in his native [[Modern Scots|Scots tongue]] and is regarded, alongside [[William Laughton Lorimer|William Lorimer]], as one of the most important modern exponents of [[prose|fine prose]] in the language. \n\nIn addition to his literary career, McLellan saw active service during [[World War Two]], served as an elected councillor for the [[Isle of Arran]], his adopted home after marriage, and was active variously in the [[League of Dramatists]], the [[Society of Authors]] and the [[Scots Language Society|Lallans Society]]. In the early 1960s he served briefly as elected President for the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947|District Councils Association for Scotland]]. He was also a frequent campaigner in defence of local heritage and a dedicated [[beekeeper]].  \n\nMcLellan today in literature is probably best remembered for the historical comedies, ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'' and ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]'', and for his short story cycle, ''[[Linmill Stories]]'', but his stage-writing career was a long and experimental one spanning over thirty years of crucial development for Scottish theatrical self-expression. In his later career he also wrote for radio and television. He was awarded a [[Civil List Pension]] in 1968 for \"services to literature in Scotland\" and received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1978.\n\n==Early career==\nRobert McLellan began life as a dramatist in the early 1930s. Much of his early work was first produced by the short-lived [[Curtain Theatre (Glasgow)|Curtain Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], a dynamic and ambitious subscription company founded in 1933 and based in the university district of the city. \n\nThis early period was a prolific and experimental one for the playwright. Throughout the decade he was effectively Curtain's \"house dramatist\", trying out various genres and modes in both Scots and English for performance before a dedicated and vocal \"[[studio]]\" audience. Some of these early works in short form, such as ''Jeddart Justice'' and ''The Changeling'', were also picked up by other non-professional companies around the country and entered in the annual [[Scottish Community Drama Association]] competitions of the era.  \n\nMcLellan's first notable success came in 1936 with Curtain's production of his full-length three-act comedy, ''Toom Byres'', set among the [[Border reivers]] in the early days of the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI]]. This was quickly followed in 1937 by ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'', set in the same period but this time in an urban milieu, its action taking place in and around the court in [[Edinburgh]] and featuring the king himself in his prime. This latter production, with the young [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]] famously creating a sensation in the title role, is generally regarded as the one which confirmed McLellan's reputation as a comic dramatist of substance in Scots. \n\nMcLellan is known to have been briefly resident in England as a [[screenwriter]] at some point around this time, but for whatever reason he soon came back to Scotland, marrying in 1938 and settling on the Isle of Arran. He continued to work with Curtain in mind, but his last production with the company, ''Portrait of an Artist'', this time written in [[Scottish English|English]] with a contemporary setting, met with less critical acclaim. For his next works, ''The Smuggler'' and ''The Bogle'', both set in the eighteenth century, the playwright made a return to historical Scots comedy. \n\nIn the event, ''The Bogle'' (later renamed ''Torwatletie''), would wait until 1946 for its debut production. By the time McLellan had completed the play, early in 1940, Curtain theatre was no more, having broken up after the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|declaration of war in 1939]]. The [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|war years]] would entail a significant interruption in McLellan's developing career as a playwright.\n\n==War years==\nBy now a first-time father, McLellan enlisted with the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1940. He served for the next five years as an anti-aircraft gunner in defence around the British Isles (outwith Scotland) and on the [[Faroe Islands]]. Having set drama aside, he turned instead to poetry and short story, modes of writing which he found more conducive within the context of military life. It was also during his years in the services, in circa 1943, while stationed on the Faroes, that he met the poet [[Hans Andrias Djurhuus|Hans Djurhuus]]. McLellan as a writer in Scots later publicly acknowledged the inspiration he derived from his meetings with Djurhuus, a writer engaged in a parallel effort to forge new literary use for his own native [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. \n\nBut during this time, the playwright had never lost sight of his principal career. As soon as hostilities ended in [[End of World War II in Europe|May 1945]], while still in uniform but freed of his duties, McLellan straightway composed the [[verse drama]] ''The Carlin Moth'' during the fortnight after [[VE Day]], by his own account, in the 'hot attic' of a mansion near [[Southwold]] on the [[Suffolk Coast and Heaths|Suffolk coast]] where his unit was stationed at the time. By combining the poetry with his drama, this resumption of his stage work had also added a new mode to his writing.\n\n==Post-war years==\nAfter [[demobilisation]] in 1946, McLellan returned to Arran. During his absence, the war years had seen developments in the Scottish theatre scene, such as the formation of [[Glasgow Unity Theatre|Unity Players]] in 1941, and [[James Bridie]]'s founding of [[Citizens Theatre|Glasgow Citizens]] in 1943, so McLellan perhaps returned with better hopes for a more professionalised institutional culture for new Scottish work. In any event, he hit the ground running. That same year, the newly composed ''Carlin Moth'' was produced on radio; the debut production of ''Torwatletie'', completed five years previously but kept on ice until his return from the war, was mounted by Unity (subsequently taken in 1947 to the first \"[[Edinburgh Fringe]]\", then on to London\u2019s [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]] in 1948); and McLellan himself was already embarked on composing his next major play, ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]''. He also by this time had ''The Cailleach'', a short Scots play with a more sombre tone, under his belt. \n\nMcLellan conceived ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' first and foremost as a professional vehicle for Bridie's recently founded Citizens, but in the later 1940s the two men began to have differences. McLellan refused permission to tour ''Jamie the Saxt'' to London after Bridie insisted on license to make re-writes. Then, in 1948, Bridie's Citizens rejected ''Flouers''. Although Unity once again mounted the debut production, they did not achieve the same success as with ''Torwatletie'', and perhaps it was the radio production in 1951, a few months after Bridie's death, in which the play was finally \"discovered\". Either way, despite the initial resistance from Citizens, ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' went on to become one of McLellan's most popular and frequently revived works. \n\n==1950s==\nCitizens did finally mount two McLellan debuts: the historical study, ''[[Mary Stewart (play)|Mary Stewart]]'', in 1950, and ''The Road to the Isles'', a contemporary satire of land activism in the [[Scottish highlands|Highlands]], in 1954. These new plays did not win the same popular success as previous plays, but McLellan's established works continued to be a popular staple among the country's thriving amateur drama clubs and associations in the [[History of television|years before television]]. With Scotland's more formal theatrical institutions of the 1950s, on the other hand, McLellan became increasingly frustrated - a frustration he publicly expressed - seeing them as often resistant to, and misapprending of, Scottish theatrical values, especially around the matter of language. \n\nIn the course of the decade McLellan increasingly turned instead to [[broadcast radio]], establishing a good working relationship with the [[BBC Home Service|Scottish Home Service]] producer [[James Crampsie]]. Crampsie was more in tune with McLellan's needs and aspritions. As well as mounting radio adaptations of his work, he commissioned new writing, including works for broadcast around [[Burns night]], and three substantial series of dramatisations of episodes from Scottish history for schools broadcasts. \n\nOne of the next highlights of McLellan's career was the broadcast of his award-winning verse drama for radio in 1957, ''Sweet Largie Bay'', with its beautiful and elegaic evocation of generational change and decline in island life. At the close of the decade, ''Rab Mossgiel'', commissioned by Crampsie to mark the Burns bicentary in 1959, was the first of the playwright's works to be broadcast on [[Television in Scotland|Scottish television]]. \n\n==1960s and after==\n\n==Legacy==\n\n==Biography==\nRobert McLellan was born in 1907 at the home of his maternal grandparents in [[Linmill]], a fruit farm close to [[Kirkfieldbank]] in the prosperous fruit-growing [[Clyde Valley]] region of [[Lanarkshire]]. His father was John McLellan, a printer by trade, who circa 1912 founded, and thereafter ran, the [[Allander Press]] in [[Milngavie]], still at that time a detached township to the north of [[Glasgow]].

He found popular success with plays and stories written in his native [[Modern Scots|Scots tongue]] and is regarded, alongside [[William Lorimer]], as one of the most important modern exponents of [[prose|fine prose]] in the language. \n\nIn addition to his literary career, McLellan saw active service during [[World War Two]], served as an elected councillor for the [[Isle of Arran]], his adopted home after marriage, and was active variously in the [[League of Dramatists]], the [[Society of Authors]] and the [[Scots Language Society|Lallans Society]]. In the early 1960s he served briefly as elected President for the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947|District Councils Association for Scotland]]. He was also a frequent campaigner in defence of local heritage and a dedicated [[beekeeper]].  \n\nMcLellan today in literature is probably best remembered for the historical comedies, ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'' and ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]'', and for his short story cycle, ''[[Linmill Stories]]'', but his stage-writing career was a long and experimental one spanning over thirty years of crucial development for Scottish theatrical self-expression. In his later career he also wrote for radio and television. He was awarded a [[Civil List Pension]] in 1968 for \"services to literature in Scotland\" and received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1978.\n\n==Early career==\nRobert McLellan began life as a dramatist in the early 1930s. Much of his early work was first produced by the short-lived [[Curtain Theatre (Glasgow)|Curtain Theatre]] in [[Glasgow]], a dynamic and ambitious subscription company founded in 1933 and based in the university district of the city. \n\nThis early period was a prolific and experimental one for the playwright. Throughout the decade he was effectively Curtain's \"house dramatist\", trying out various genres and modes in both Scots and English for performance before a dedicated and vocal \"[[studio]]\" audience. Some of these early works in short form, such as ''Jeddart Justice'' and ''The Changeling'', were also picked up by other non-professional companies around the country and entered in the annual [[Scottish Community Drama Association]] competitions of the era.  \n\nMcLellan's first notable success came in 1936 with Curtain's production of his full-length three-act comedy, ''Toom Byres'', set among the [[Border reivers]] in the early days of the reign of [[James VI and I|James VI]]. This was quickly followed in 1937 by ''[[Jamie the Saxt]]'', set in the same period but this time in an urban milieu, its action taking place in and around the court in [[Edinburgh]] and featuring the king himself in his prime. This latter production, with the young [[Duncan Macrae (actor)|Duncan Macrae]] famously creating a sensation in the title role, is generally regarded as the one which confirmed McLellan's reputation as a comic dramatist of substance in Scots. \n\nMcLellan is known to have been briefly resident in England as a [[screenwriter]] at some point around this time, but for whatever reason he soon came back to Scotland, marrying in 1938 and settling on the Isle of Arran. He continued to work with Curtain in mind, but his last production with the company, ''Portrait of an Artist'', this time written in [[Scottish English|English]] with a contemporary setting, met with less critical acclaim. For his next works, ''The Smuggler'' and ''The Bogle'', both set in the eighteenth century, the playwright made a return to historical Scots comedy. \n\nIn the event, ''The Bogle'' (later renamed ''Torwatletie''), would wait until 1946 for its debut production. By the time McLellan had completed the play, early in 1940, Curtain theatre was no more, having broken up after the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|declaration of war in 1939]]. The [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|war years]] would entail a significant interruption in McLellan's developing career as a playwright.\n\n==War years==\nBy now a first-time father, McLellan enlisted with the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1940. He served for the next five years as an anti-aircraft gunner in defence around the British Isles (outwith Scotland) and on the [[Faroe Islands]]. Having set drama aside, he turned instead to poetry and short story, modes of writing which he found more conducive within the context of military life. It was also during his years in the services, in circa 1943, while stationed on the Faroes, that he met the poet [[Hans Andrias Djurhuus|Hans Djurhuus]]. McLellan as a writer in Scots later publicly acknowledged the inspiration he derived from his meetings with Djurhuus, a writer engaged in a parallel effort to forge new literary use for his own native [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. \n\nBut during this time, the playwright had never lost sight of his principal career. As soon as hostilities ended in [[End of World War II in Europe|May 1945]], while still in uniform but freed of his duties, McLellan straightway composed the [[verse drama]] ''The Carlin Moth'' during the fortnight after [[VE Day]], by his own account, in the 'hot attic' of a mansion near [[Southwold]] on the [[Suffolk Coast and Heaths|Suffolk coast]] where his unit was stationed at the time. By combining the poetry with his drama, this resumption of his stage work had also added a new mode to his writing.\n\n==Post-war years==\nAfter [[demobilisation]] in 1946, McLellan returned to Arran. During his absence, the war years had seen developments in the Scottish theatre scene, such as the formation of [[Glasgow Unity Theatre|Unity Players]] in 1941, and [[James Bridie]]'s founding of [[Citizens Theatre|Glasgow Citizens]] in 1943, so McLellan perhaps returned with better hopes for a more professionalised institutional culture for new Scottish work. In any event, he hit the ground running. That same year, the newly composed ''Carlin Moth'' was produced on radio; the debut production of ''Torwatletie'', completed five years previously but kept on ice until his return from the war, was mounted by Unity (subsequently taken in 1947 to the first \"[[Edinburgh Fringe]]\", then on to London\u2019s [[Embassy Theatre (London)|Embassy Theatre]] in 1948); and McLellan himself was already embarked on composing his next major play, ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]''. He also by this time had ''The Cailleach'', a short Scots play with a more sombre tone, under his belt. \n\nMcLellan conceived ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' first and foremost as a professional vehicle for Bridie's recently founded Citizens, but in the later 1940s the two men began to have differences. McLellan refused permission to tour ''Jamie the Saxt'' to London after Bridie insisted on license to make re-writes. Then, in 1948, Bridie's Citizens rejected ''Flouers''. Although Unity once again mounted the debut production, they did not achieve the same success as with ''Torwatletie'', and perhaps it was the radio production in 1951, a few months after Bridie's death, in which the play was finally \"discovered\". Either way, despite the initial resistance from Citizens, ''Flouers o Edinburgh'' went on to become one of McLellan's most popular and frequently revived works. \n\n==1950s==\nCitizens did finally mount two McLellan debuts: the historical study, ''[[Mary Stewart (play)|Mary Stewart]]'', in 1950, and ''The Road to the Isles'', a contemporary satire of land activism in the [[Scottish highlands|Highlands]], in 1954. These new plays did not win the same popular success as previous plays, but McLellan's established works continued to be a popular staple among the country's thriving amateur drama clubs and associations in the [[History of television|years before television]]. With Scotland's more formal theatrical institutions of the 1950s, on the other hand, McLellan became increasingly frustrated - a frustration he publicly expressed - seeing them as often resistant to, and misapprending of, Scottish theatrical values, especially around the matter of language. \n\nIn the course of the decade McLellan increasingly turned instead to [[broadcast radio]], establishing a good working relationship with the [[BBC Home Service|Scottish Home Service]] producer [[James Crampsie]]. Crampsie was more in tune with McLellan's needs and aspritions. As well as mounting radio adaptations of his work, he commissioned new writing, including works for broadcast around [[Burns night]], and three substantial series of dramatisations of episodes from Scottish history for schools broadcasts. \n\nOne of the next highlights of McLellan's career was the broadcast of his award-winning verse drama for radio in 1957, ''Sweet Largie Bay'', with its beautiful and elegaic evocation of generational change and decline in island life. At the close of the decade, ''Rab Mossgiel'', commissioned by Crampsie to mark the Burns bicentary in 1959, was the first of the playwright's works to be broadcast on [[Television in Scotland|Scottish television]]. \n\n==1960s and after==\n\n==Legacy==\n\n==Biography==\nRobert McLellan was born in 1907 at the home of his maternal grandparents in [[Linmill]], a fruit farm close to [[Kirkfieldbank]] in the prosperous fruit-growing [[Clyde Valley]] region of [[Lanarkshire]]. His father was John McLellan, a printer by trade, who circa 1912 founded, and thereafter ran, the [[Allander Press]] in [[Milngavie]], still at that time a detached township to the north of [[Glasgow]]. Although the young McLellan grew up in Milngavie, he generally spent his summer holidays the Lanarkshire farm of his grandparents, and it was those times in the immediate pre-First World War period, which later became the inspiration for his ''Linmill Stories''. \n\nAfter attending [[Bearsden Academy]] in Glasgow, McLellan entered the [[University of Glasgow]] as an undergraduate in moral philosophy in 1925. He did not complete his degree, possibly abandoning his studies after the death of his mother from tuberculosis in 1928. \n\nMcLellan met his future wife, Kathleen Heys from [[Grindleton]], [[Lancashire]], sometime before 1933 while rambling in the [[Lake District]]. They married in 1938, settling in Arran where they lived modestly on McLelllan's income as a playwright, latterly supplemented in the post-war years by the produce of his [[beekeeping]] and Kathleen\u2019s [[handicraft|hand crafts]]. \n\nMcLellan died suddenly at home in High Corrie on the day before his 78th birthday in January 1985. He is buried on Arran. \n\n==List of works by Robert McLellan==\n\n===Stage plays===\nDates of first productions:\n* 1934 - '''''Jeddart Justice, A Border Comedy in One Act''''' (Curtain Theatre, Glasgow)\n* 1934 -
