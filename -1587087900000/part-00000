His father married him to his ward, Amelia, the heiress of [[Cognac, France]], in [[Charente]].

R. Ricardi 1 m. de dono R.''\" (\"''And to Philip, son of King Richard, one mark as a gift''\"). A passage in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] briefly mentions Philip's death in 1230, although it is unknown weather or not he actually died that year. It seems likely that he died early in the 13th century, although it may be that he acquired a new territorial designation (Cognac having been the territory of his late wife), perhaps through re-marriage, which has blurred the trail of documentary evidence.\n\n==Philip in fiction, drama and film==\nThe sparsely-documented historical Philip of Cognac has been developed in literature. [[William Shakespeare]] depicted him as ''Philip the Bastard'' in his play, ''[[King John (play)|The Life and Death of King John]]''. In this, he is the son of Lady Faulconbridge, widow of Sir Robert Faulconbridge, and learns of his true paternity in the first scene:\n:Madam, I would not wish a better father.\n:He that perforce robs lions of their hearts\n:May easily win a woman's.\nHowever, as mentioned above, nothing is known of the real Philip's mother. Shakespeare's character is essentially a fictional creation, who shares only a name and a father with his historical counterpart.\n\nAnother highly fictionalised version of Philip, played by [[Stephen Moyer]], figures as the [[romantic hero]] of ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'' (2001), a made-for-TV [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] adventure for young viewers, in which [[Keira Knightley]] plays Gwyn, the daughter of [[Robin Hood]]. This follows the tradition, begun by [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] and popularised by [[Walter Scott]], of assigning the Hood legends to Richard's reign. In this, Robin Hood, his daughter and the outlaws help Philip win the throne from his uncle, Prince John, and Philip and Gwyn fall in love.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==Sources==\n*\"Comptes d'Alfonse de Poitiers\" in ''Archives historiques du Poitou'', vol. 4 (Poitiers, 1872) (available via external link to [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica]).\n*John Gillingham, ''Richard C\u0153ur de Lion: Kingship, Chivalry and War in the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1994). \n*John Gillingham, ''Richard I'' (Yale, 1999).\n*Oliver de Laborderie, \"L'image de Richard C\u0153ur de Lion dans ''La Vie et la Mort du roi Jean'' de William Shakespeare\", in Janet L.
