He assumed management positions at various [[state-owned companies]]. In 1978, he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Pagoh]]. During his term as Member of Parliament, he was appointed [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Malaysia|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|minister of foreign affairs]], [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Deputy ministers|deputy minister of federal territories]] and later [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Composition before cabinet dissolution|deputy minister of trade and industry]].

He received his secondary education at the Muar High School, Johor. Subsequently, he attended the [[University of Malaya]], Kuala Lumpur and received an honours bachelor's degree in economics and Malay studies in 1971.\n\n==Early career==\nAfter the completion of his studies, Muhyiddin joined the Johor state public service as the assistant secretary of training and scholarship. In 1974, he was appointed the assistant district officer (ADO) of [[Muar District|Muar]]. He left the civil service to join the corporate sector in the Johor State Economic Development Corporation (PKENJ), managing its subsidiary companies like Sergam Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131977), Equity Mal (Johore) Sdn Bhd as Director (1974\u20131978), Sri Saujana Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131978) and SGS Ates (M) Sdn Bhd as [[Human Resources Manager]] (1974).\n\n== Political career ==\nMuhyiddin's involvement in politics began when he joined [[UMNO]] as ordinary member at the [[Pagoh]] division in 1971. He was elected as [[UMNO]] Youth Chief of the Pagoh division and the Secretary in 1976. Later he became Youth Chief of Johor state [[UMNO]] Youth until 1987.\n\nMuhyiddin occupied the seats of Exco in the national Malaysia UMNO Youth. In 1984, Muhyiddin was elected the UMNO Division Chief of Pagoh replacing [[Othman Saat]]. Muhyiddin rose up the ranks and file of Johor UMNO quickly. From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].

He assumed management positions at various [[state-owned companies]]. In 1978, he was elected as [[Dewan Rakyat|Member of Parliament]] for [[Pagoh]]. During his term as Member of Parliament, he was appointed [[List of Parliamentary Secretaries of Malaysia|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)|minister of foreign affairs]], [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Deputy ministers|deputy minister of federal territories]] and later [[Second Mahathir cabinet#Composition before cabinet dissolution|deputy minister of trade and industry]].

He received his secondary education at the Muar High School, Johor. Subsequently, he attended the [[University of Malaya]], Kuala Lumpur and received an honours bachelor's degree in economics and Malay studies in 1971.\n\n==Early career==\nAfter the completion of his studies, Muhyiddin joined the Johor state public service as the assistant secretary of training and scholarship. In 1974, he was appointed the assistant district officer (ADO) of [[Muar District|Muar]]. He left the civil service to join the corporate sector in the Johor State Economic Development Corporation (PKENJ), managing its subsidiary companies like Sergam Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131977), Equity Mal (Johore) Sdn Bhd as Director (1974\u20131978), Sri Saujana Berhad as managing director (1974\u20131978) and SGS Ates (M) Sdn Bhd as [[Human Resources Manager]] (1974).\n\n== Political career ==\nMuhyiddin's involvement in politics began when he joined [[UMNO]] as ordinary member at the [[Pagoh]] division in 1971. He was elected as [[UMNO]] Youth Chief of the Pagoh division and the Secretary in 1976. Later he became Youth Chief of Johor state [[UMNO]] Youth until 1987.\n\nMuhyiddin occupied the seats of Exco in the national Malaysia UMNO Youth. In 1984, Muhyiddin was elected the UMNO Division Chief of Pagoh replacing [[Othman Saat]]. Muhyiddin rose up the ranks and file of Johor UMNO quickly. From being a state executive council member, he rose to become [[Johor]] UMNO's head and later became Menteri Besar of Johor.\n\nMuhyiddin contested and was elected Member of Parliament for the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh constituency]] in the 1978 general election and kept the seat until 1982. Muhyiddin was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; subsequently he was promoted to Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Federal Territories and later the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In the 1986 general election, Muhyiddin contested and won the [[Johor State Legislative Assembly|Johor State Legislative]] constituency seat of Bukit Serampang, opening the path for him to become the [[Menteri Besar of Johor]] on 13 August 1986.\n\nHis tenure as Menteri Besar lasted until 6 May 1995.\n\nMuhyiddin returned to contest the [[Pagoh (federal constituency)|Pagoh parliamentary seat]] in the [[1995 Malaysian general election|1995 General Election]].\n\nHe served several different federal government cabinet posts as [[Minister of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister of Youth and Sports]] (1995\u20131999), [[Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (Malaysia)|Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs]] (1999\u20132004), [[Minister of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry]] (2004\u20132008) and [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] (2008\u20132009). He was appointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister of Education]], by Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2009.\n\nIn 1984, Muhyiddin contested a UMNO Supreme Council seat but lost. Muhyiddin was later appointed the UMNO Johor state liaison chairman and next appointed a Supreme Council member. In November 1990 he was a candidate for the UMNO vice-presidency, but lost again. Muhyiddin attempted again in the November 1993 UMNO party election, successfully this time. But he lost the 1996 election when defending the vice-president post. Eventually, in the election in 2000, he again won the post of vice-president of UMNO, remaining in that post until the October 2008 party election, when Muhyiddin successfully sought the higher post of deputy president, which was left vacant as the incumbent, Najib Razak (who was acting party president after the retirement of [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]), became UMNO president.\n\n==2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election==\nMuhyiddin attacked [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s original transition plan as \"too long\", and some people say that at one point Muhyiddin was about to ask and force Abdullah to quit, though he never did so directly. During the 2008 general election, Muhyiddin managed to keep his seat and remained as an UMNO leader. Shocked by the election results, he called for reforms.\n\nDuring the 2009 UMNO General Assembly and party election, Muhyiddin was a candidate for the deputy president post which was vacated by the incoming prime minister [[Najib Tun Razak]]. He was challenged by [[Mohd Ali Rustam]], Malacca chief minister, and [[Muhammad Muhammad Taib]], Rural and Regional Development Minister. Muhyiddin, seen as a supporter of [[Mahathir Mohamad]], was seen to be the front-runner for the race, garnering many nominations by the UMNO divisions. But the competition was tough, as Taib and Rustam gained more ground especially from the Badawi camp. The race was tipped by political analysts to be very tight. However, the UMNO supreme council decided to disqualify Ali Rustam's candidacy after his assistants were caught involved with corruption after an investigation. The election resulted in Muhyiddin's election to the post with 1,575 votes to Muhammad Taib's 916.\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n\nMuhyiddin was appointed deputy prime minister on 9 April 2009, when Najib took over from Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and unveiled his [[First Najib cabinet|first Cabinet]].\n\nContinuing as [[Minister of Education (Malaysia)|Minister for Education]], he announced the decision to return to the teaching of mathematics and science in Malay in all government primary and secondary schools.<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision \"Muhyiddin defends PPSMI decision\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825153840/http://www2.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/32910-muhyiddin-defends-ppsmi-decision |date=25 August 2009 }}, ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'', 21 July 2009.</ref>\n\nMuhyiddin waded into controversy in March 2010 by stating he was '[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] first' rather than 'Malaysian first'.<ref>{{YouTube|_rxiJSs7aYE|Muhyiddin: I'm Malay first}} 31 March 2010</ref> He also said that there is nothing wrong with other races doing the same; for example, the Chinese could claim themselves to be \"[[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] first, [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] second\" and same for the [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]].

With the possible exception of the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' and other groups loyal to the [[Communist Party of France]], the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]]'' groups were mostly unorganised and unrelated to one another. This lack of coordination made them less effective in their actions against the [[Nazi]] occupiers.\n\n==Formation and Meeting of Resistance Fighters==\n\n[[Charles de Gaulle]], exiled in London and recognized by the UK as [[Charles de Gaulle#1940\u20131945: The Free French Forces|leader]] of a French [[government in exile]], began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements. On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to [[Jean Moulin]]. Moulin achieved the feat on May 27, 1943 with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance in the apartment of Ren\u00e9 Corbin on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in [[Paris]].\n\nAside from Moulin and his two assistants, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Meunier|fr}} and [[Robert Chambeiron]], participants in the first meeting included representatives of the eight main French resistance movements, members of six of France's major political parties and the two large pre-war trade unions all attended the Rue du Four meeting.\n\nRepresentatives of the eight major resistance movements:\n\n*[[Pierre Villon]] (''[[Front National (French Resistance)|Front National]]'')\n*[[Roger Coquoin]] (''[[Ceux de la Lib\u00e9ration]]'')\n*[[Jacques Lecompte-Boinet]] (''[[Ceux de la R\u00e9sistance]]'')\n*[[Charles Laurent]] (''[[Lib\u00e9ration-Nord]]'')\n*[[Pascal Copeau]] (''[[Lib\u00e9ration-Sud]]'')\n* Jacques-Henri Simon (''[[Organisation Civile et Militaire]]'')\n*[[Claude Bourdet]] (''[[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]'')\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Claudius-Petit]] (''[[Franc-Tireur (movement)|Franc-Tireur]]'')\nUnder Jean Moulin's earlier influence, Combat, Franc-Tireur and Lib\u00e9ration-Sud had already agreed to regroup themselves in January 1943 to create the [[Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance]], with their joint military arms forming the [[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (Secret Army).\n\nRepresentatives of the two trade unions:\n\n*[[Louis Saillant]] (''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail]]'')\n*[[Gaston Tessier]] (''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des Travailleurs Chr\u00e9tiens]]'')\n\nRepresentatives of the six main political parties of the [[French Third Republic]]: \n*[[Andr\u00e9 Mercier]] (''[[French Communist Party]]'')\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Le Troquer]] (''[[Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale ouvri\u00e8re]]'')\n*[[Marc Rucart]] (''[[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialists]]'')\n*[[Georges Bidault]] (''[[Popular Democratic Party (France)|Parti d\u00e9mocrate populaire]]'')\n*[[Joseph Laniel]] (''[[Alliance D\u00e9mocratique (France)|l'Alliance D\u00e9mocratique]]'')\n*[[Jacques Debu-Bridel]] (''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration r\u00e9publicaine]]'')\n\n==Arrest of Jean Moulin==\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:JeanMoulinPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The ''iconic'' photo of [[Jean Moulin]] with his hat and scarf]] -->\n[[File:Resistance.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Drawing of Jean Moulin based on ''iconic'' photo with hat and scarf, [[Cross of Lorraine#Symbol in France|cross of Lorraine]] in background]]\nHowever, shortly after the CNR's creation, its president Jean Moulin was arrested at [[Caluire-et-Cuire|Caluire]] by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Over the next three days, Moulin was tortured by [[Klaus Barbie]] himself, and would die during his transfer to Germany. He divulged no information to his torturers and his silence was likely to have allowed the CNR to pursue its activities. \n\nAfter Moulin's capture and death, the ''Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance'' decided for security reasons to end its plenary sessions and created an executive office of five members, with each member representing his own group and two others. The new office was under the direction of [[Alexandre Parodi]], delegate-general, and [[Georges Bidault]], the new president.

With the possible exception of the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]'' and other groups loyal to the [[Communist Party of France]], the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]]'' groups were mostly unorganised and unrelated to one another. This lack of coordination made them less effective in their actions against the [[Nazi]] occupiers.\n\n==Formation and Meeting of Resistance Fighters==\n\n[[Charles de Gaulle]], exiled in London and recognized by the UK as [[Charles de Gaulle#1940\u20131945: The Free French Forces|leader]] of a French [[government in exile]], began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements. On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to [[Jean Moulin]]. Moulin achieved the feat on May 27, 1943 with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance in the apartment of Ren\u00e9 Corbin on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in [[Paris]].\n\nAside from Moulin and his two assistants, {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Meunier|fr}} and [[Robert Chambeiron]], participants in the first meeting included representatives of the eight main French resistance movements, members of six of France's major political parties and the two large pre-war trade unions all attended the Rue du Four meeting.\n\nRepresentatives of the eight major resistance movements:\n\n*[[Pierre Villon]] (''[[Front National (French Resistance)|Front National]]'')\n*[[Roger Coquoin]] (''[[Ceux de la Lib\u00e9ration]]'')\n*[[Jacques Lecompte-Boinet]] (''[[Ceux de la R\u00e9sistance]]'')\n*Charles Laurent (''[[Lib\u00e9ration-Nord]]'')\n*[[Pascal Copeau]] (''[[Lib\u00e9ration-Sud]]'')\n* Jacques-Henri Simon (''[[Organisation Civile et Militaire]]'')\n*[[Claude Bourdet]] (''[[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]'')\n*[[Eug\u00e8ne Claudius-Petit]] (''[[Franc-Tireur (movement)|Franc-Tireur]]'')\nUnder Jean Moulin's earlier influence, Combat, Franc-Tireur and Lib\u00e9ration-Sud had already agreed to regroup themselves in January 1943 to create the [[Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance]], with their joint military arms forming the [[Arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (Secret Army).\n\nRepresentatives of the two trade unions:\n\n*[[Louis Saillant]] (''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail]]'')\n*[[Gaston Tessier]] (''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des Travailleurs Chr\u00e9tiens]]'')\n\nRepresentatives of the six main political parties of the [[French Third Republic]]: \n*[[Andr\u00e9 Mercier]] (''[[French Communist Party]]'')\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Le Troquer]] (''[[Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale ouvri\u00e8re]]'')\n*[[Marc Rucart]] (''[[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialists]]'')\n*[[Georges Bidault]] (''[[Popular Democratic Party (France)|Parti d\u00e9mocrate populaire]]'')\n*[[Joseph Laniel]] (''[[Alliance D\u00e9mocratique (France)|l'Alliance D\u00e9mocratique]]'')\n*[[Jacques Debu-Bridel]] (''[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration r\u00e9publicaine]]'')\n\n==Arrest of Jean Moulin==\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:JeanMoulinPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The ''iconic'' photo of [[Jean Moulin]] with his hat and scarf]] -->\n[[File:Resistance.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Drawing of Jean Moulin based on ''iconic'' photo with hat and scarf, [[Cross of Lorraine#Symbol in France|cross of Lorraine]] in background]]\nHowever, shortly after the CNR's creation, its president Jean Moulin was arrested at [[Caluire-et-Cuire|Caluire]] by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Over the next three days, Moulin was tortured by [[Klaus Barbie]] himself, and would die during his transfer to Germany. He divulged no information to his torturers and his silence was likely to have allowed the CNR to pursue its activities. \n\nAfter Moulin's capture and death, the ''Conseil National de la R\u00e9sistance'' decided for security reasons to end its plenary sessions and created an executive office of five members, with each member representing his own group and two others.

The movie begins in Hong Kong with a sex scene between the lovers and their discussion of a lamp with the [[Iguazu Falls]] that Ho Po-Wing bought, deciding that they would visit it together. In Buenos Aires, the couple take a road trip to the falls, however, they get lost and their car breaks down, making them get into an argument and break up. Fai's voice-over tells the audience that breakups are typical in their relationship and the rekindling of their romance often reignites when Po-Wing says to Fai \"let's start over\". Both without enough money to fly back home, Fai ends up as a promoter for a [[tango]] bar in Buenos Aires serving mainly groups of women tourists from [[Taiwan]], and Ho Po-Wing begins engaging in [[sex work]], bringing many of his clients to the bar. Ho Po-Wing tries to get back together with Fai but instead they end up arguing about Po-Wing's irresponsible use of their money. Later, Po-Wing returns to apologize and gives Fai a watch to sell which he supposedly stole from one of his clients because he returns the next day after being beat up. Po-Wing asks Fai to return the watch, which he does, but the next day Po-Wing turns up even more badly hurt than the first time, prompting Fai to take Po-Wing to the hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, Po-Wing is unable to care for himself and he thus moves into Fai's apartment. Fai cooks and cares for Po-Wing as he recovers slowly, but rejects Po-Wing's romantic advances at first. As time passes, they start falling in love again, culminating in them practicing the tango together in their apartment and in the kitchen.\n \nAt the tango bar, Fai sees one of Po-Wing's old clients, supposedly the one who hurt Po-Wing and follows him into the bar, smashing a beer bottle on his head and therefore losing his job. Fai then starts to work as a cook helper at a Chinese restaurant, where he meets Chang ([[Chang Chen]]), a young Taiwanese man. Chang has exceptionally good hearing, and he often overhears Fai's call with Po-Wing during work. In one scene he answers Po-Wing's phone call for Fai. Po-Wing starts to suspect that Fai is sleeping with another man to which Fai gets annoyed and prompting an argument, with Fai asking Po-Wing about his past boyfriends. Fully recovered, Po-Wing begins going out again much to Fai's dismay as he starts to feel lonely and jealous. One night, Po-Wing demands that Fai return his passport which he stole when Po-Wing was first injured. This causes another argument as Fai firmly refuses to return it and Po-Wing destroys the apartment looking for it, ending with Po-Wing leaving for good. Fai's voice-over returns, explaining that he was happiest when Po-Wing was injured and a part of him wanted Po-Wing  to remain that way in order to preserve their romantic relationship. \n\nMeanwhile, Fai befriends Chang at the restaurant. Chang rejects a female coworker's invitation to go to a movie together, preferring to stay at the restaurant with Fai. Chang claims it is because he is attracted to women with deep, low voices. Fai and Chang play soccer as a team together with their coworkers, and they win quite often. Chang quits his job during the summer, telling Fai that he has made enough money to continue his journey, and he hopes to visit the lighthouse at the southern-most tip of Argentina, or the end of the world. On his last night in Buenos Aires, Chang explains that he does not like photographs but rather voice recordings to remember Fai, his only friend in [[Argentina]]. Chang also tells Fai that he would play the recording when he reaches the end of the world, where it is said that one can let go of their past troubles. Fai gives his voice recorder to Fai and asks him to say something from the heart but all Fai can do is sob. After Chang has left, Fai begins going to public bathrooms and theatres to hookup with other men, and he sees Ho Po-Wing unexpectedly. He then realizes that loneliness is the reason Po-Wing had so many lovers in the past and that Fai himself is now in the same situation.  \n\nLater, Fai narrates that in [[Hong Kong]], he worked for a close friend of his dad, and had stolen money from him to fund his and Po-Wing's trip to Buenos Aires. Since then, Fai has been saving money hoping to repay what he took and restart his life in Hong Kong. He calls his father to apologize and update him on his current life but is rejected. Then, Fai begins writing a [[Christmas]] card to his father, which turned into a long letter in which he comes clean implicitly about his theft and relationships with men. Fai starts to work in a [[slaughterhouse]] because it pays well and enables him live his life in Hong Kong time. He realizes that Argentina is at the opposite end of the earth, and begins to wonder what Hong Kong is like upside down. Po-Wing calls Fai demanding his passport back but Fai doesn't pick up the phone. Fai narrates that he would like to return Ho Po-Wing's passport but he doesn't want to meet him and restart the cycle of their relationship all over again.  \n\nSoon, Fai has made enough money to return to Hong Kong. He finally visits the [[Iguazu Falls]] before leaving Argentina. Meanwhile, Ho Po-Wing calls Fai only to learn that he is not there. Ho Po-Wing dances the tango with a random guy at the bar where Fai used to work, while reminiscing dancing with Fai. Po-Wing cleans Fai's room while waiting for Fai to return and fixes the lamp of the Iguazu Falls before weeping mournfully. Fai is at the [[Iguazu Falls]] alone and narrates that he is regretful because he thinks that two people should be visiting the falls together, paralleling the two figures on the lamp. Chang visits the lighthouse at the end of the world and plays his recorder, hearing Fai weep. Before Chang ends his trip in Argentina, he returns to Buenos Aires hoping to say goodbye to Fai, but no one knows where he is. Chang wonders about the other end of the world, specifically the Liaoning Street [[night market]] in [[Taipei]]. Coincidentally, Fai makes a stop in Taipei for one night before going home to Hong Kong and visits the booth run by Chang's family in Liaoning Street night market. Through his voice-over, Fai realizes that Chang is able to wander around so freely while travelling because Chang knows that he has a home that he can return to. Before Fai leaves the booth, he takes a photo of Chang, saying that even though he doesn't know if he will ever see Chang again, he knows where to find him. The last scene shows Fai on a train in Taipei listening to Danny Chung's cover of [[the Turtles]]' song \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\". \n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] as Ho Po-Wing\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as Lai Yiu-Fai\n* [[Chang Chen|Chen Chang]] as Chang\n* Gregory Dayton as Lover\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Box Office===\nDuring its Hong Kong theatrical release, ''Happy Together'' made HK $8,600,141 at the box office.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The tally is unspectacular, but respectable given the subject matter and restrictive [[Hong Kong motion picture rating system|Category III]] rating; it was also typical of a Wong Kar-Wai film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n''Happy Together'' also had a limited theatrical run in North America through [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]], where it grossed US$320,319.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happytogether.htm|title=Happy Together (1997) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship ===\nThe producers of the film considered censoring the film, specifically the opening sex scene for certain audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/happy-together-2-1117329753/|title=Film Review: Happy Together|last=Elley|first=Derek|last2=Elley|first2=Derek|date=1997-05-25|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Posters for the movie featuring the two leads fully clothed with their legs intertwined was banned from public places in Hong Kong and removed all together before the movie's release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3011485/when-wong-kar-wais-gay-film-happy-together-won|title=When Wong Kar-wai's gay film Happy Together won big at Cannes|date=2019-05-23|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n===Critical Reception===\nThe film was generally well received in Hong Kong and has been since heavily analyzed by many Chinese and [[Hongkongers|Hong Kongese]] scholars and film critics such as [[Rey Chow]] (\u5468\u857e) and \u9673\u528d\u6885.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewslens.com/article/122303|title=\u300a\u6eab\u60c5\u4e3b\u7fa9\u5bd3\u8a00\u30fb\u7576\u4ee3\u83ef\u8a9e\u96fb\u5f71\u300b\uff1a\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\u611b\u617e\u95dc\u4fc2\u8f49\u6210\u6df1\u6df1\u9109\u6101|last=\u7cbe\u9078\u66f8\u6458|date=2019-07-18|website=The News Lens \u95dc\u9375\u8a55\u8ad6\u7db2|language=zh-Hant-TW|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.orangenews.hk/culture/system/2019/10/09/010128429.shtml|title=\u3010\u9ed1\u8272\u96fb\u5f71\u3011\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\uff1a\u8eab\u4efd\u610f\u8b58\u7684\u5207\u63db\u8207\u63a2\u7d22|website=\u6a59\u65b0\u805e|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nA Hong Kong film review site called it an \"elliptical, quicksilver experiment\" that is \"pure Wong Kar-Wai, which is equal parts longing, regret, and pathetic beauty\u201d and applauding it for its cinematography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews/happy_together.htm|title=Happy Together (1997)|website=www.lovehkfilm.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nDue to the international recognition that the film received, it was reviewed in several major U.S. publications.

However, by winning the Cannes festival award for Best Director for Happy Together, his first major award, Wong was given a spotlight on the international stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2094145/pictures-happy-together-tony-leung-leslie-cheung-romance-put-wong|title=In pictures: Wong Kar-wai's romantic film Happy Together turns 20|date=2017-05-14|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nIn this film, Wong Kar-wai moved away from his previous centralization of American and British music, instead, mostly favouring [[South America|South American]] music. This transnationalism \"decentralizes America\" and forms new connections between cultures that are not conventionally linked (Hong Kong and Argentina). The first song of the film, [[Caetano Veloso]]'s cover of \u201cCucurruc\u00fa Paloma\u201d, a sad [[ballad]] about a man waiting for his lover to return plays when the couple breaks up for the first time in the film. Here, [[Iguazu Falls|the Iguazu Falls]] are seen for the first time and it is also the first shot of the film that is in colour. The song extends Fai's thoughts where he is imagining the waterfall which he associated with Po-Wing, his sadness and lovesickness becoming apparent in this South American setting.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Kersting, Erik, author.|title=East, west, and gendered subjectivity : the music of Wong Kar-Wai|year=2018|isbn=978-0-438-03277-4|oclc=1128098058}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical Motifs ===\n[[Frank Zappa]], an American experimental rock artist's song \u201cChunga\u2019s Revenge\u201d is played throughout the movie \u201cemphasizing [Fai's] difficult relationship with [Po-Wing]\u201d. The loud guitar chorus represents Po-Wing's \u201cvolatile, flamboyant nature\u201d which contrasts the somber trumpet and slower beat representing Fai's sensitivity and steadiness. This song is also linked to Lai's loneliness and his longing to be \u201chappy together\u201d while showing the difference between the two characters and the increasing emotional distance between them as the film progresses.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Astor Piazzolla|Astor Piazollo]]\u2019s \u201cFinale (Tango Apasionado)\u201d and similar [[bandoneon]] songs play when the couple is both together and apart, representing their relationship. These songs play during romantic scenes such as the taxi scene, tango in the kitchen. However it is also played after Fai and Po-Wing break up for the last time and Po-Wing dances the tango with a random man while thinking about when he danced with Fai. The last time this song is played when Fai reaches the waterfall and the same shot of the [[Iguazu Falls]] as the beginning of the film is seen but this time with the \"Finale\" song. This \u201ceulogizes that relationship\u201d as Po-Wing breaks down in Fai's old apartment, realizing that he has abandoned their relationship because Fai left behind the lamp while Fai mourns their relationship at the falls.<ref name=\":4\" /> Wong Kar-wai discovered Astor Piazollo's music when he bought his CDs in the Amsterdam airport on his way to Buenos Aires to film this movie.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wong, Kar-wai, 1958- interviewee.|title=Wong Kar-Wai : interviews|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4968-1284-1|oclc=1023090817}}</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\u201d, [[the Turtles]]' song covered by Danny Chung is the last song to be played in the film when Fai is on the train in Taipei. This song is used to subvert Western music tropes that use it \u201cto celebrate a budding romance or as an ironic commentary on the lack of such a romance\u201d. It also shows that \u201cLai is at peace with their relationship, making it a crucial narrative device denoting the meaning of the film\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile interpretations vary, [[Wong Kar-wai]] has said that:\n\n:\"In this film, some audiences will say that the title seems to be very cynical, because it is about two persons living together, and at the end, they are just separate. But to me, happy together can apply to two persons or apply to a person and his past, and I think sometimes when a person is at peace with himself and his past, I think it is the beginning of a relationship which can be happy, and also he can be more open to more possibilities in the future with other people.\"<ref>{{cite interview|subject-link=Wong Kar-wai|interviewer=Khoi Lebinh; David Eng|title=Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.asiastudios.com/interviews/members/wongkarwai.html|access-date=20 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514140143/http://www.asiastudios.com/interviews/members/wongkarwai.html|archive-date=14 May 2008|publisher=WBAI|date=October 27, 1997|subject=Wong Kar-wai|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Themes and Interpretations ==\n\n=== [[Nationality]], [[Belongingness|Belonging]], and [[Identity]] ===\nAt the very beginning of the movie, Wong includes shots of Fai's [[British National (Overseas) passport|British National Overseas Passport]] as a way to indicate to the audience that this film will be dealing with issues of nationality.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinezen.hk/?p=9158|title=\u57cb\u85cf\u5728\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\u88e1\u7684\u6642\u4ee3\u60c5\u7dd2 {{!}} \u6620\u756b\u624b\u6c11|website=www.cinezen.hk|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> \n\n==== [[Handover of Hong Kong|The Handover of Hong Kong]] ====\nReleased in May 1997, intentionally before the [[handover of Hong Kong]] from the British to China on June 30, 1997 after 100 years of [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule, the film represents the uncertainty of the future felt by the Hong Kong people at the time.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/09/03/the-brief-idyll-of-late-90s-wong-kar-wai/|title=The Brief Idyll of Late-Nineties Wong Kar-Wai|last=Aw|first=Tash|date=2019-09-03|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The films subtitle: \"A Story About Reunion\" also implies that the film would comment on the handover.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Suner|first=Asuman|date=2006|title=Outside in: 'accented cinema' at large|journal=Inter-Asia Cultural Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1080/14649370600849223|hdl=11693/49209|issn=1464-9373}}</ref> The inclusion of the date in the opening and the news broadcast of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s death on February 20, 1997 serve to place the audience explicitly in the time period immediately before the [[Handover of Hong Kong]]. Some have suggested that the English title of the film is in relation to the uncertainty around if Hong Kong and China would be \"happy together\" after their reunion.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn one interpretation, Po-Wing and Fai represent two sides of Hong Kong that cannot be reconciled: Po-Wing stays in Buenos Aires without a passport, like Hong Kong Chinese people who don't have a real British passport, representing an \"eternal exile and diaspora\". Fai, however, is able to see the waterfall and go to Taiwan but it is not shown whether Fai is able to reconcile with his father or not. Since Po-Wing wants his passport, meaning he wants to leave Buenos Aires, both main characters show that they feel uncertain about their place in the diaspora.<ref>{{Citation|last=Berry|first=Chris|title=Queer Asian Cinema: Shadows in the Shade|chapter=Happy Alone? Sad Young Men in East Asian Gay Cinema|date=2018-10-24|pages=187\u2013200|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315877174-7|isbn=978-1-315-87717-4}}</ref>\n\nA different interpretation stated that Fai, a gay man, represents the social freedoms that the Hong Kong people possess and the runaway son who travelled to the other side of the world: Buenos Aires in the film and Britain historically. But, this son (Hong Kong and Fai) \"must return and reconcile his differences with old-fashioned China\u201d which is represented by Fai's father. Chang here, represents Taiwan, a country with a similar past as Hong Kong with China, who comforts Fai (Hong Kong), showing him that there is hope for the future. This hope is demonstrated through the increasing saturation of the film as Fai's life becomes more and more stable.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Buenos Aires ====\nWong's choice of Buenos Aires is particular because it is the antipode of Hong Kong, meaning it is on the opposite side of the world and in an opposite time. This had been interpreted as a place where Fai and Po-Wing were looking for the opposite of home and Hong Kong. They do not describe this as a political allegory but rather a questioning of culture identity and the definitions of \"home, belonging, and migrancy\".<ref name=\":7\" /> Another interpretation viewed the scenes of Hong Kong shot upside down not as a  political allegory either, but a way to show how far the characters were from their roots.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nSimilarly, the theme of displacement from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires interestingly  emphasizes their similarities rather than their differences when compared to the shots of Hong Kong in Wong Kar-wai's previous films. Despite being on the other side of the world and far from their \"home\", the couple experiences the same problems, implying the inevitability of their relationship's deterioration. By emphasizing the similarities between these two places, Wong emphasizes the homelessness and lack of belonging of both Fai and Po-Wing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Confinement ====\nAnother theme of the film is the sense of confinement and claustrophobia that accompanies the sense of non-belonging of Fai and Po-Wing. This is conveyed through the shaky handheld camera, the small size poor lighting, and dirtiness of Fai's apartment, the kitchen, alleys, the tango bar, the restaurant kitchen, and the public bathroom corridor. This confinement is also manifested through Po-Wing's confinement to Fai's apartment because his injured hands prevent him from taking care of himself. Later, Po-Wing is also confined to Buenos Aires because Fai refuses to return his passport. Yet, the imagery of the [[Iguazu Falls]] contrast the theme of confinement with the symbolic openness of possibility and hope of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Marginalization ====\nOne interpretation explained that the lack of a sense of belonging due to a combination of their marginal race, sexuality, and language<ref name=\":5\" /> in Buenos Aires and Hong Kong prevented Po-Wing and Fai from forming a stable relationship. This instability is in part shown through the instability of the camera in some shots, relating to the character's inability to find their own place in the world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Neither place is welcoming and the couple experiences the same problems in both places.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe marginalization of Fai specifically is demonstrated by the way he visually cannot blend into the crowds and environments in Buenos Aires in comparison to Taipei. It is only in Taipei that Fai smiles, and it is implied that he feels a sense of belonging as he visits the Chang family noodle shop and takes the train. The movie does not definitively show that Fai returns to Hong Kong, making it possible that he stayed in Taipei, where he feels like he belongs and begins to have hope for the future.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== The [[Iguazu Falls]] and the Lamp ===\nThe importance of the [[Iguazu Falls]] is established early on in the film when it is shown on the lamp that Po-Wing bought for Fai and is said to be the entire reason the couple chose to go to Buenos Aires in the first place.<ref name=\":7\" /> The real waterfall is then shown in Fai's imaginings after the first break up as the first shot in colour. It is also shot from a birds eye view and given unrealistic blue and green colouring, giving it a supernatural visual effect. \n\nOne scholar interpreted the representation of the falls as a contemplation on the immensity of mother nature's power and the unpredictable nature of the future since the end of the waterfall is imperceivable. It also evokes a feeling of powerlessness in the face of nature and the future, paralleling the inevitability of the deterioration of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother scholar interpreted the waterfall itself as a symbol of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship because \u201ctheir passion is indeed torrential, destructive, always pounding away as it falls head forward and spirals downward towards an uncertain end\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Chin-Yi|date=2016|title=Queer love in Wong Kar Wai's Happy Together (1997)|url=|journal=Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture|volume=16|pages=|via=Gale Academic OneFile}}</ref>\n\nThe falls are seen throughout the film on the lamp in Fai's apartment, representing the continued hope and investment in his relationship with Po-Wing. However, when Fai finally visits the [[Iguazu Falls]] but without Po-Wing, leaving the lamp behind, Po-Wing understands that Fai has finally abandoned their relationship. Both Fai and Po-Wing mourn their relationship by looking at the waterfall, Fai seeing it in reality, and Po-Wing after having fixed the lamp's rotating mechanism.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== [[Queer|Queerness]] ===\nThe [[Queer|queerness]] of the film is highly contested. On one hand, it is characterized as \"one of the best films chronicling gay love ever made\" because of the universality of the problems that Fai and Po-Wing face in their relationship that exist in any relationship no matter the gender of the participants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nochimson|first=Martha P.|date=2005|title=Beautiful Resistance: The Early Films of Wong Kar-wai|url=|journal=Cin\u00e9aste|volume=30|pages=9\u201313|via=}}</ref> Many scholars and film critics agree that while being gay is not the subject of the film, its portrayal of gay romance is realistic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royer|first=Genevi\u00e8ve|date=September 1997|title=Happy Together|url=|journal=S\u00e9quences|volume=|pages=26\u201327|via=}}</ref> The film was praised for not casting the characters on gendered lines, questioning their manliness, and showing the complexity of gay men as social beings and individuals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWong Kar-wai explained that: <blockquote>\"In fact, I don\u2019t like people to see this film as a gay film. It\u2019s more like a story about human relationships and somehow the two characters involved are both men. Normally I hate movies with labels like \u2018gay film,\u2019 \u2018art film\u2019 or \u2018commercial film.\u2019 There is only good film and bad film\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>On the other hand, some scholars argue that one of the reasons that Po-Wing and Fai ended up in Buenos Aires is because they are gay and are thus exiled queer men.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Jeremy Tambling]], an author and critic noted that the universalization of the gay relationship is not a positive aspect of the film because it erases the specificity of their experiences and the film's theme of marginalization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tambling, Jeremy.|title=Wong Kar-wai's Happy Together|date=2003|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8053-35-3|oclc=1032571763}}</ref> Furthermore, the film broadly portrays [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] values of hard work, frugality, and normativity, highlighting its lack of queerness and emphasis of [[heteronormativity]]. Fai is rewarded for following these values as he works constantly, cooks, cares for other, wants to reconcile with his father, and saves his money. While Po-Wing lives in excess through his numerous sexual encounters, spending, lack of traditional work, and flamboyance. At the end of the film, Fai is able to reach his destination, Hong Kong/Taiwan and [[Iguazu Falls|the Iguazu Falls]] while Po-Wing is stuck in Buenos Aires without a passport. Chang also represents these values as he works hard at the restaurant, saves enough money for his trip to the 'end of the world', and has a loving family to return to in Taipei. The characters who conform to this normativity are rewarded while others are punished, thus emphasizing a \"straight\" narrative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Audrey|date=2000|title=What's so queer about Happy Together? a.k.a.

More specifically, he cited the scene where Chiron's mother scolds him and pink light emanated from her bedroom as particularly inspired by [[Wong Kar-wai]] and [[Christopher Doyle]]'s work.\n\nAt the 2017 Golden Horse Awards, ''Happy Together'' was re-screened in celebration of the film's 20th anniversary.

The movie begins in Hong Kong with a sex scene between the lovers and their discussion of a lamp with the [[Iguazu Falls]] that Ho Po-Wing bought, deciding that they would visit it together. In Buenos Aires, the couple take a road trip to the falls, however, they get lost and their car breaks down, making them get into an argument and break up. Fai's voice-over tells the audience that breakups are typical in their relationship and the rekindling of their romance often reignites when Po-Wing says to Fai \"let's start over\". Both without enough money to fly back home, Fai ends up as a promoter for a [[tango]] bar in Buenos Aires serving mainly groups of women tourists from [[Taiwan]], and Ho Po-Wing begins engaging in [[sex work]], bringing many of his clients to the bar. Ho Po-Wing tries to get back together with Fai but instead they end up arguing about Po-Wing's irresponsible use of their money. Later, Po-Wing returns to apologize and gives Fai a watch to sell which he supposedly stole from one of his clients because he returns the next day after being beat up. Po-Wing asks Fai to return the watch, which he does, but the next day Po-Wing turns up even more badly hurt than the first time, prompting Fai to take Po-Wing to the hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, Po-Wing is unable to care for himself and he thus moves into Fai's apartment. Fai cooks and cares for Po-Wing as he recovers slowly, but rejects Po-Wing's romantic advances at first. As time passes, they start falling in love again, culminating in them practicing the tango together in their apartment and in the kitchen.\n \nAt the tango bar, Fai sees one of Po-Wing's old clients, supposedly the one who hurt Po-Wing and follows him into the bar, smashing a beer bottle on his head and therefore losing his job. Fai then starts to work as a cook helper at a Chinese restaurant, where he meets Chang ([[Chang Chen]]), a young Taiwanese man. Chang has exceptionally good hearing, and he often overhears Fai's call with Po-Wing during work. In one scene he answers Po-Wing's phone call for Fai. Po-Wing starts to suspect that Fai is sleeping with another man to which Fai gets annoyed and prompting an argument, with Fai asking Po-Wing about his past boyfriends. Fully recovered, Po-Wing begins going out again much to Fai's dismay as he starts to feel lonely and jealous. One night, Po-Wing demands that Fai return his passport which he stole when Po-Wing was first injured. This causes another argument as Fai firmly refuses to return it and Po-Wing destroys the apartment looking for it, ending with Po-Wing leaving for good. Fai's voice-over returns, explaining that he was happiest when Po-Wing was injured and a part of him wanted Po-Wing  to remain that way in order to preserve their romantic relationship. \n\nMeanwhile, Fai befriends Chang at the restaurant. Chang rejects a female coworker's invitation to go to a movie together, preferring to stay at the restaurant with Fai. Chang claims it is because he is attracted to women with deep, low voices. Fai and Chang play soccer as a team together with their coworkers, and they win quite often. Chang quits his job during the summer, telling Fai that he has made enough money to continue his journey, and he hopes to visit the lighthouse at the southern-most tip of Argentina, or the end of the world. On his last night in Buenos Aires, Chang explains that he does not like photographs but rather voice recordings to remember Fai, his only friend in [[Argentina]]. Chang also tells Fai that he would play the recording when he reaches the end of the world, where it is said that one can let go of their past troubles. Fai gives his voice recorder to Fai and asks him to say something from the heart but all Fai can do is sob. After Chang has left, Fai begins going to public bathrooms and theatres to hookup with other men, and he sees Ho Po-Wing unexpectedly. He then realizes that loneliness is the reason Po-Wing had so many lovers in the past and that Fai himself is now in the same situation.  \n\nLater, Fai narrates that in [[Hong Kong]], he worked for a close friend of his dad, and had stolen money from him to fund his and Po-Wing's trip to Buenos Aires. Since then, Fai has been saving money hoping to repay what he took and restart his life in Hong Kong. He calls his father to apologize and update him on his current life but is rejected. Then, Fai begins writing a [[Christmas]] card to his father, which turned into a long letter in which he comes clean implicitly about his theft and relationships with men. Fai starts to work in a [[slaughterhouse]] because it pays well and enables him live his life in Hong Kong time. He realizes that Argentina is at the opposite end of the earth, and begins to wonder what Hong Kong is like upside down. Po-Wing calls Fai demanding his passport back but Fai doesn't pick up the phone. Fai narrates that he would like to return Ho Po-Wing's passport but he doesn't want to meet him and restart the cycle of their relationship all over again.  \n\nSoon, Fai has made enough money to return to Hong Kong. He finally visits the [[Iguazu Falls]] before leaving Argentina. Meanwhile, Ho Po-Wing calls Fai only to learn that he is not there. Ho Po-Wing dances the tango with a random guy at the bar where Fai used to work, while reminiscing dancing with Fai. Po-Wing cleans Fai's room while waiting for Fai to return and fixes the lamp of the Iguazu Falls before weeping mournfully. Fai is at the [[Iguazu Falls]] alone and narrates that he is regretful because he thinks that two people should be visiting the falls together, paralleling the two figures on the lamp. Chang visits the lighthouse at the end of the world and plays his recorder, hearing Fai weep. Before Chang ends his trip in Argentina, he returns to Buenos Aires hoping to say goodbye to Fai, but no one knows where he is. Chang wonders about the other end of the world, specifically the Liaoning Street [[night market]] in [[Taipei]]. Coincidentally, Fai makes a stop in Taipei for one night before going home to Hong Kong and visits the booth run by Chang's family in Liaoning Street night market. Through his voice-over, Fai realizes that Chang is able to wander around so freely while travelling because Chang knows that he has a home that he can return to. Before Fai leaves the booth, he takes a photo of Chang, saying that even though he doesn't know if he will ever see Chang again, he knows where to find him. The last scene shows Fai on a train in Taipei listening to Danny Chung's cover of [[the Turtles]]' song \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\". \n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] as Ho Po-Wing\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as Lai Yiu-Fai\n* [[Chang Chen|Chen Chang]] as Chang\n* Gregory Dayton as Lover\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Box Office===\nDuring its Hong Kong theatrical release, ''Happy Together'' made HK $8,600,141 at the box office.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The tally is unspectacular, but respectable given the subject matter and restrictive [[Hong Kong motion picture rating system|Category III]] rating; it was also typical of a Wong Kar-Wai film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n''Happy Together'' also had a limited theatrical run in North America through [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]], where it grossed US $320,319.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happytogether.htm|title=Happy Together (1997) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship ===\nThe producers of the film considered censoring the film, specifically the opening sex scene for certain audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/happy-together-2-1117329753/|title=Film Review: Happy Together|last=Elley|first=Derek|last2=Elley|first2=Derek|date=1997-05-25|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Posters for the movie featuring the two leads fully clothed with their legs intertwined was banned from public places in Hong Kong and removed all together before the movie's release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3011485/when-wong-kar-wais-gay-film-happy-together-won|title=When Wong Kar-wai's gay film Happy Together won big at Cannes|date=2019-05-23|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n===Critical Reception===\nThe film was generally well received in Hong Kong and has been since heavily analyzed by many Chinese and [[Hongkongers|Hong Kongese]] scholars and film critics such as [[Rey Chow]] (\u5468\u857e) and \u9673\u528d\u6885.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenewslens.com/article/122303|title=\u300a\u6eab\u60c5\u4e3b\u7fa9\u5bd3\u8a00\u30fb\u7576\u4ee3\u83ef\u8a9e\u96fb\u5f71\u300b\uff1a\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\u611b\u617e\u95dc\u4fc2\u8f49\u6210\u6df1\u6df1\u9109\u6101|last=\u7cbe\u9078\u66f8\u6458|date=2019-07-18|website=The News Lens \u95dc\u9375\u8a55\u8ad6\u7db2|language=zh-Hant-TW|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.orangenews.hk/culture/system/2019/10/09/010128429.shtml|title=\u3010\u9ed1\u8272\u96fb\u5f71\u3011\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\uff1a\u8eab\u4efd\u610f\u8b58\u7684\u5207\u63db\u8207\u63a2\u7d22|website=\u6a59\u65b0\u805e|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nA Hong Kong film review site called it an \"elliptical, quicksilver experiment\" that is \"pure Wong Kar-Wai, which is equal parts longing, regret, and pathetic beauty\u201d and applauding it for its cinematography.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews/happy_together.htm|title=Happy Together (1997)|website=www.lovehkfilm.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nDue to the international recognition that the film received, it was reviewed in several major U.S. publications.

This transnationalism \"decentralizes America\" and forms new connections between cultures that are not conventionally linked (Hong Kong and Argentina). The first song of the film, [[Caetano Veloso]]'s cover of \u201cCucurruc\u00fa Paloma\u201d, a sad [[ballad]] about a man waiting for his lover to return plays when the couple breaks up for the first time in the film. Here, [[Iguazu Falls|the Iguazu Falls]] are seen for the first time and it is also the first shot of the film that is in colour. The song extends Fai's thoughts where he is imagining the waterfall which he associated with Po-Wing, his sadness and lovesickness becoming apparent in this South American setting.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Kersting, Erik, author.|title=East, west, and gendered subjectivity : the music of Wong Kar-Wai|year=2018|isbn=978-0-438-03277-4|oclc=1128098058}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical Motifs ===\n[[Frank Zappa]], an American experimental rock artist's song \u201cChunga\u2019s Revenge\u201d is played throughout the movie \u201cemphasizing [Fai's] difficult relationship with [Po-Wing]\u201d. The loud guitar chorus represents Po-Wing's \u201cvolatile, flamboyant nature\u201d which contrasts the somber trumpet and slower beat representing Fai's sensitivity and steadiness. This song is also linked to Lai\u2019s loneliness and his longing to be \u201chappy together\u201d while showing the difference between the two characters and the increasing emotional distance between them as the film progresses.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Astor Piazzolla|Astor Piazollo]]\u2019s \u201cFinale (Tango Apasionado)\u201d and similar [[bandoneon]] songs play when the couple is both together and apart, representing their relationship. These songs play during romantic scenes such as the taxi scene, tango in the kitchen. However it is also played after Fai and Po-Wing break up for the last time and Po-Wing dances the tango with a random man while thinking about when he danced with Fai. The last time this song is played when Fai reaches the waterfall and the same shot of the [[Iguazu Falls]] as the beginning of the film is seen but this time with the \"Finale\" song.

Some have suggested that the English title of the film is in relation to the uncertainty around if Hong Kong and China would be \"happy together\" after their reunion.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn one interpretation, Po-Wing and Fai represent two sides of Hong Kong that cannot be reconciled: Po-Wing stays in Buenos Aires without a passport, like Hong Kong Chinese people who don\u2019t have a real British passport, representing an \"eternal exile and diaspora\". Fai, however, is able to see the waterfall and go to Taiwan but it is not shown whether Fai is able to reconcile with his father or not. Since Po-Wing wants his passport, meaning he wants to leave Buenos Aires, both main characters show that they feel uncertain about their place in the diaspora.<ref>{{Citation|last=Berry|first=Chris|title=Queer Asian Cinema: Shadows in the Shade|chapter=Happy Alone? Sad Young Men in East Asian Gay Cinema|date=2018-10-24|pages=187\u2013200|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315877174-7|isbn=978-1-315-87717-4}}</ref>\n\nA different interpretation stated that Fai, a gay man, represents the social freedoms that the Hong Kong people possess and the runaway son who travelled to the other side of the world: Buenos Aires in the film and Britain historically. But, this son (Hong Kong and Fai) \"must return and reconcile his differences with old-fashioned China\u201d which is represented by Fai's father. Chang here, represents Taiwan, a country with a similar past as Hong Kong with China, who comforts Fai (Hong Kong), showing him that there is hope for the future. This hope is demonstrated through the increasing saturation of the film as Fai's life becomes more and more stable.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Buenos Aires ====\nWong's choice of Buenos Aires is particular because it is the antipode of Hong Kong, meaning it is on the opposite side of the world and in an opposite time. This had been interpreted as a place where Fai and Po-Wing were looking for the opposite of home and Hong Kong. They do not describe this as a political allegory but rather a questioning of culture identity and the definitions of \"home, belonging, and migrancy\".<ref name=\":7\" /> Another interpretation viewed the scenes of Hong Kong shot upside down not as a  political allegory either, but a way to show how far the characters were from their roots.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nSimilarly, the theme of displacement from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires interestingly  emphasizes their similarities rather than their differences when compared to the shots of Hong Kong in Wong Kar-wai's previous films. Despite being on the other side of the world and far from their \"home\", the couple experiences the same problems, implying the inevitability of their relationship's deterioration. By emphasizing the similarities between these two places, Wong emphasizes the homelessness and lack of belonging of both Fai and Po-Wing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Confinement ====\nAnother theme of the film is the sense of confinement and claustrophobia that accompanies the sense of non-belonging of Fai and Po-Wing. This is conveyed through the shaky handheld camera, the small size poor lighting, and dirtiness of Fai's apartment, the kitchen, alleys, the tango bar, the restaurant kitchen, and the public bathroom corridor. This confinement is also manifested through Po-Wing's confinement to Fai's apartment because his injured hands prevent him from taking care of himself. Later, Po-Wing is also confined to Buenos Aires because Fai refuses to return his passport. Yet, the imagery of the [[Iguazu Falls]] contrast the theme of confinement with the symbolic openness of possibility and hope of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Marginalization ====\nOne interpretation explained that the lack of a sense of belonging due to a combination of their marginal race, sexuality, and language<ref name=\":5\" /> in Buenos Aires and Hong Kong prevented Po-Wing and Fai from forming a stable relationship. This instability is in part shown through the instability of the camera in some shots, relating to the character's inability to find their own place in the world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Neither place is welcoming and the couple experiences the same problems in both places.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe marginalization of Fai specifically is demonstrated by the way he visually cannot blend into the crowds and environments in Buenos Aires in comparison to Taipei. It is only in Taipei that Fai smiles, and it is implied that he feels a sense of belonging as he visits the Chang family noodle shop and takes the train. The movie does not definitively show that Fai returns to Hong Kong, making it possible that he stayed in Taipei, where he feels like he belongs and begins to have hope for the future.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== The [[Iguazu Falls]] and the Lamp ===\nThe importance of the [[Iguazu Falls]] is established early on in the film when it is shown on the lamp that Po-Wing bought for Fai and is said to be the entire reason the couple chose to go to Buenos Aires in the first place.<ref name=\":7\" /> The real waterfall is then shown in Fai's imaginings after the first break up as the first shot in colour. It is also shot from a birds eye view and given unrealistic blue and green colouring, giving it a supernatural visual effect. \n\nOne scholar interpreted the representation of the falls as a contemplation on the immensity of mother nature's power and the unpredictable nature of the future since the end of the waterfall is imperceivable. It also evokes a feeling of powerlessness in the face of nature and the future, paralleling the inevitability of the deterioration of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother scholar interpreted the waterfall itself as a symbol of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship because \u201ctheir passion is indeed torrential, destructive, always pounding away as it falls head forward and spirals downward towards an uncertain end\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Chin-Yi|date=2016|title=Queer love in Wong Kar Wai's Happy Together (1997)|url=|journal=Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture|volume=16|pages=|via=Gale Academic OneFile}}</ref>\n\nThe falls are seen throughout the film on the lamp in Fai's apartment, representing the continued hope and investment in his relationship with Po-Wing. However, when Fai finally visits the [[Iguazu Falls]] but without Po-Wing, leaving the lamp behind, Po-Wing understands that Fai has finally abandoned their relationship. Both Fai and Po-Wing mourn their relationship by looking at the waterfall, Fai seeing it in reality, and Po-Wing after having fixed the lamp's rotating mechanism.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== [[Queer|Queerness]] ===\nThe [[Queer|queerness]] of the film is highly contested. On one hand, it is characterized as \"one of the best films chronicling gay love ever made\" because of the universality of the problems that Fai and Po-Wing face in their relationship that exist in any relationship no matter the gender of the participants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nochimson|first=Martha P.|date=2005|title=Beautiful Resistance: The Early Films of Wong Kar-wai|url=|journal=Cin\u00e9aste|volume=30|pages=9\u201313|via=}}</ref> Many scholars and film critics agree that while being gay is not the subject of the film, its portrayal of gay romance is realistic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royer|first=Genevi\u00e8ve|date=September 1997|title=Happy Together|url=|journal=S\u00e9quences|volume=|pages=26\u201327|via=}}</ref> The film was praised for not casting the characters on gendered lines, questioning their manliness, and showing the complexity of gay men as social beings and individuals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWong Kar-wai explained that: <blockquote>\"In fact, I don\u2019t like people to see this film as a gay film. It\u2019s more like a story about human relationships and somehow the two characters involved are both men. Normally I hate movies with labels like \u2018gay film,\u2019 \u2018art film\u2019 or \u2018commercial film.\u2019 There is only good film and bad film\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>On the other hand, some scholars argue that one of the reasons that Po-Wing and Fai ended up in Buenos Aires is because they are gay and are thus exiled queer men.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Jeremy Tambling]], an author and critic noted that the universalization of the gay relationship is not a positive aspect of the film because it erases the specificity of their experiences and the film's theme of marginalization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tambling, Jeremy.|title=Wong Kar-wai's Happy Together|date=2003|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-988-8053-35-3|oclc=1032571763}}</ref> Furthermore, the film broadly portrays [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] values of hard work, frugality, and normativity, highlighting its lack of queerness and emphasis of [[heteronormativity]]. Fai is rewarded for following these values as he works constantly, cooks, cares for other, wants to reconcile with his father, and saves his money. While Po-Wing lives in excess through his numerous sexual encounters, spending, lack of traditional work, and flamboyance. At the end of the film, Fai is able to reach his destination, Hong Kong/Taiwan and [[Iguazu Falls|the Iguazu Falls]] while Po-Wing is stuck in Buenos Aires without a passport. Chang also represents these values as he works hard at the restaurant, saves enough money for his trip to the 'end of the world', and has a loving family to return to in Taipei. The characters who conform to this normativity are rewarded while others are punished, thus emphasizing a \"straight\" narrative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Audrey|date=2000|title=What's so queer about Happy Together? a.k.a.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

Although these bivalved crustaceans are not new to science, their fossils preserve the delicate appendages and further show the diversity of the lightly biomineralized fossils of the Waukesha Biota.<ref name=Jonesetal2015/>\n\n==== Cheloniellids ====\nCommon in the Waukesha Biota is an arthropod that has a pair of large raptorial appendages.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/> It has been identified as a new and the best preserved member of the enigmatic arthropod group known as the [[cheloniellid]]a.<ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/> Although the taxon was given a name, the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed, and the name is therefore not officially recognized.\n\n==== Myriapods ====\nSeveral fossils appearing to be [[myriapod]]s (the group that includes [[millipede]]s and [[centipede]]s) have been found in the Waukesha Biota.<ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\n==== Other arthropods ====\nOther kinds of arthropods having varying degrees of biomineralization of their skeletal elements are also present in the Waukesha Biota, including leperditicopid [[ostracod]]s ([[crustacea]]), and about thirteen species of [[trilobite]]s, several of which are new. Some trilobite taxa preserve their digestive tracts. An unnamed dalmanitid is commonly found with its dorsal exoskeleton intact and sometimes seen in such numbers that they cover large surfaces of sediment.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\nSome [[taxa]] do not readily fit within existing arthropod groups, such as the very common \u201cbutterfly animal,\u201d which appears to have two wing-like extensions at its sides, but may be another enigmatic bivalved arthropod.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=180px>\nParioscorpio lungs.png|Pulmonary-cardiovascular structures of ''[[Parioscorpio]]''\nCheloniellid.jpg|A [[cheloniellid]] [[arthropod]]\nDalmanitid trilobite.jpg|Dalmanitid [[trilobite]]; the most common trilobite of the Waukesha Biota\nMeroperyx.jpg|The styginid trilobite ''[[Meroperyx]]''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Anomalocarid? ===\nThe grasping appendage of what is questionably attributed to an [[anomalocarid]] was found among the Waukesha Biota material. <ref name=Wendruff2016>{{cite book |last=Wendruff |first=A.J. |title=Paleobiology and Taphonomy of Exceptionally Preserved Organisms from the Brandon Bridge Formation (Silurian), Wisconsin, USA|date=2016 |publisher=Ph.D dissertation, Ohio State University  |location= |pages=|url= https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1468844814#abstract-files}}</ref> If this identification proves accurate, the specimen would be the first occurrence of an anomalocarid to be found in the Silurian.<ref name=Giribet&Edgecombe2019>{{cite journal | title=The phylogeny and evolutionary history of arthropods |journal=Current Biology |volume=29 |issue= 12|pages=592\u2013602 |year=2019 |last1=Giribet |first1=G. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=G.D. |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2019.04.057 |pmid=31211983 }}</ref>\n\n=== Lobopods ===\nSeveral unnamed species of [[lobopod]]s (worm-like animals with annulated appendages) are known from the Waukesha Biota.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name=Wendruff2016/> One of these was originally thought to be a [[myriopod]] arthropod until further study revealed key lobopod characteristics.<ref name=Wilsonetal2004/>\n\n=== \"Worms\" ===\nMany exquisitely preserved [[vermiform]] fossils, some preserving digestive tracts, are part of the Waukesha biota.
