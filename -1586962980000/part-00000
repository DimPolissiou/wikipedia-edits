The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, written by various songwriters and performed by the characters with original dance choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted [[ladybug]]. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, written by various songwriters and performed by the characters with original dance choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

This symbol is generally placed on a Wiccan altar to honor the elements and directions.]]\n'''Wicca''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|\u02c8|w|\u026a|k|\u0259}}), also termed '''Pagan Witchcraft''', is a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion. [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] categorise it as both a [[new religious movement]] and as part of the [[occultism|occultist]] stream of [[Western esotericism]]. It was developed in [[England]] during the first half of the 20th century and was [[Witchcraft Today|introduced to the public]] in 1954 by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil servant]]. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of [[paganism|ancient pagan]] and [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|20th-century hermetic]] [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]]s for its [[theology|theological]] structure and [[ritual]] practices.\n\nWicca has no central authority figure. Its traditional core beliefs, principles and practices were originally outlined in the 1940s and 1950s by Gardner and [[Doreen Valiente]], both in published books and in secret written and oral teachings passed along to their initiates. There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time. It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, [[sect]]s and [[Religious denomination|denominations]], referred to as ''traditions'', each with its own [[organisational structure]] and level of [[centralisation]]. Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as [[British Traditional Wicca]], strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term ''Wicca'' to apply only to similar traditions, but not to newer, [[#Eclectic Wicca|eclectic]] traditions.\n\nWicca is typically [[duotheism|duotheistic]], worshipping a Goddess and a God. These are traditionally viewed as the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], respectively. These deities may be regarded in a [[henotheism|henotheistic]] way, as having many different divine aspects which can in turn be identified with many diverse pagan deities from different historical pantheons. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as the \"Great Goddess\" and the \"Great Horned God\", with the adjective \"great\" connoting a deity that contains many other deities within their own nature. These two deities are sometimes viewed as facets of a greater [[pantheism|pantheistic]] [[divinity]], which is regarded as an impersonal force or process rather than a personal deity. While [[duotheism]] or bitheism is traditional in Wicca, broader Wiccan beliefs range from [[polytheism]] to [[pantheism]] or [[monism]], even to [[Goddess movement|Goddess monotheism]].\n\nWiccan celebrations encompass both the [[lunar phase|cycles of the Moon]], known as [[Esbat]]s and commonly associated with the Goddess (female deity), and the cycles of the Sun, seasonally based festivals known as [[Sabbat]]s and commonly associated with the Horned God (male deity). An unattributed statement known as the [[Wiccan Rede]] is a popular expression of Wiccan morality, although it is not universally accepted by Wiccans.

she claimed that whereas the cult as recorded in the Early Modern witch trials had venerated a Horned God, centuries before it had also worshipped a Mother Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=87}} This duotheistic Horned God/Mother Goddess structure was embraced by Gardner \u2013 who claimed that it had Stone Age roots \u2013 and remains the underlying theological basis to his Gardnerian tradition.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=87\u201388}} Gardner claimed that the names of these deities were to be kept secret within the tradition, although in 1964 they were publicly revealed to be Cernunnos and Aradia; the secret Gardnerian deity names were subsequently changed.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=91}}\n\nAlthough different Wiccans attribute different traits to the Horned God, he is most often associated with animals and the natural world, but also with the afterlife, and he is furthermore often viewed as an ideal role model for men.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=88}} The Mother Goddess has been associated with life, fertility, and the springtime, and has been described as an ideal role model for women.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=89}} Wicca's duotheism has been compared to the [[Taoism|Taoist]] system of [[yin and yang]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=87}}\n\nOther Wiccans have adopted the original Gardnerian God/Goddess duotheistic structure but have adopted deity forms other than that of the Horned God and Mother Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=89\u201390}} For instance, the God has been interpreted as the [[Oak King]] and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]], as well as the Sun God, Son/Lover God, and Vegetation God.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}} He has also been seen in the roles of the [[Wild Hunt#Leader of the Wild Hunt|Leader of the Wild Hunt]] and the Lord of Death.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pearson |first=Joanne E. |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Lindsay |title=Wicca |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |volume=14 |pages=9730 |publisher=Macmaillan Reference USA |location=Detroit |year=2005}}</ref> The Goddess is often portrayed as a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], thereby being a triadic deity comprising a Maiden goddess, a [[Mother goddess]], and a Crone goddess, each of whom has different associations, namely virginity, fertility and wisdom.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}}{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1987|pp=29\u201337}} Other Wiccan conceptualisations have portrayed her as a [[lunar deity|Moon Goddess]] and as a Menstruating Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}} According to the anthropologist Susan Greenwood, in Wicca the Goddess is \"a symbol of self-transformation - she is seen to be constantly changing and a force for change for those who open themselves up to her.\"{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=103}}\n\n====Monotheism and polytheism====\n\nGardner stated that beyond Wicca's two deities was the \"Supreme Deity\" or \"[[unmoved mover|Prime Mover]]\", an entity that was too complex for humans to understand.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} This belief has been endorsed by other prominent practitioners, who have referred to it as \"the Cosmic Logos\", \"Supreme Cosmic Power\", or \"Godhead\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} Gardner envisioned this Supreme Deity as a [[deism|deist]] entity who had created the \"Under-Gods\", among them the God and Goddess, but who was not otherwise involved in the world; alternately, other Wiccans have interpreted such an entity as a pantheistic being, of whom the God and Goddess are facets.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n[[File:Horned God.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Sculpture of the Horned God of Wicca found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]]]]\n\nAlthough Gardner criticised monotheism, citing the [[Problem of Evil]],{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} explicitly monotheistic forms of Wicca developed in the 1960s, when the U.S.-based [[Church of Wicca]] developed a theology rooted in the worship of what they described as \"one deity, without gender\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=93}} In the 1970s, Dianic Wiccan groups developed which were devoted to a singular, monotheistic Goddess; this approach was often criticised by members of British Traditional Wiccan groups, who lambasted such Goddess monotheism as an inverted imitation of Christian theology.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=94}} As in other forms of Wicca, some Goddess monotheists have expressed the view that the Goddess is not an entity with a literal existence, but rather a Jungian archetype.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=95}}\n\nAs well as pantheism and duotheism, many Wiccans accept the concept of [[polytheism]], thereby believing that there are many different deities. Some accept the view espoused by the occultist [[Dion Fortune]] that \"all gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess\" \u2013 that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are, respectively, aspects of one supernal God and Goddess. With this mindset, a Wiccan may regard the Germanic [[\u0112ostre]], Hindu [[Kali]], and Catholic [[Virgin Mary]] each as manifestations of one supreme Goddess and likewise, the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], the ancient Greek [[Dionysus]] and the Judeo-Christian [[Yahweh]] as aspects of a single, archetypal god. A more strictly [[polytheism|polytheistic]] approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right. The Wiccan writers [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Gavin Bone]] have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview.{{sfn|Farrar|Bone|2004}} Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical [[archetype]]s or [[thoughtform]]s, thereby technically allowing them to be [[atheism|atheists]].{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=25, 34\u201335}} Such a view was purported by the High Priestess [[Vivianne Crowley]], herself a [[psychology|psychologist]], who considered the Wiccan deities to be [[Jungian archetypes]] that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual. It was for this reason that she said that \"The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision.\"<ref name=\"Crowleyarchetype\">{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |authorlink=Vivianne Crowley |title=Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Millennium |publisher=Thorsons |location=London |page=129 |year=1996 |isbn=0-7225-3271-7 |oclc=34190941}}</ref>\nWiccans often believe that the gods are not perfect and can be argued with.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=52}}\n\nMany Wiccans also adopt a more explicitly polytheistic or [[animism|animistic]] world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=95\u201396}} In many cases these spirits are associated with the natural world, for instance as ''[[genius loci]]'', [[fairies]], and [[elementals]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=96}} In other cases, such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical; the prominent Wiccan [[Sybil Leek]] for instance endorsed a belief in [[angel]]s.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=96}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[File:Wiccan altar for Beltane in Wales.png|thumb|A Wiccan altar decorated to mark the festival of [[Beltane]] (30 April/1 May)]]\nBelief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans and does not occupy a central place within the religion.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} As the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] remarked, \"the instinctual position of most [Wiccans]&nbsp;... seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=393}} Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife,{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=148}} it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from [[Hawaiian religion]] that the human being has three souls.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}}\n\nAlthough not accepted by all Wiccans, a belief in [[reincarnation]] is the dominant afterlife belief within Wicca, having been originally espoused by Gardner.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} Understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners; the prominent Wiccan [[Raymond Buckland]] for instance insisted that human souls would only incarnate into human bodies, whereas other Wiccans believe that a human soul can incarnate into any life form.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=147}} There is also a common Wiccan belief that any Witches will come to be reincarnated as future Witches, an idea originally expressed by Gardner.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=147}} Gardner also articulated the view that the human soul rested for a period between bodily death and its incarnation, with this resting place commonly being referred to as \"[[The Summerland]]\" among the Wiccan community.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} This allows many Wiccans to believe that [[Mediumship|mediums]] are able to contact the spirits of the deceased, a belief adopted from [[Spiritualism]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}}\n\n===Magic===\nMany Wiccans believe in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], a manipulative force exercised through the practice of [[witchcraft]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by [[ceremonial magic]]ians,{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} such as [[Aleister Crowley]], who declared that magic was \"the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will\", while another prominent ceremonial magician, [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]] stated that it was \"the science of the control of the secret forces of nature\".{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science,{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} and as such they do not view it as being [[supernatural]], but a part of what [[Leo Martello]] calls the \"super powers that reside in the natural\".{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=158\u2013159}} Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses in order to achieve surprising results,{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=158\u2013159}} whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=394\u2013395}} Some spell it \"magick\", a variation coined by the influential occultist Aleister Crowley, though this spelling is more commonly associated with Crowley's religion of [[Thelema]] than with Wicca.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nDuring ritual practices, which are often staged in a [[sacred circle]], Wiccans cast [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] or \"workings\" intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for [[energy medicine|healing]], for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|pp=250\u2013265}} Many early Wiccans, such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], [[Sybil Leek]] and [[Alex Winfield]], referred to their own magic as \"[[magic (paranormal)|white magic]]\", which contrasted with \"[[black magic]]\", which they associated with [[evil]] and [[Satanism]]. Sanders also used the similar terminology of \"[[left hand path]]\" to describe malevolent magic, and \"[[right hand path]]\" to describe magic performed with good intentions;<ref>{{cite book |first=Alex |last=Sanders |authorlink=Alex Sanders (Wiccan) |title=The Alex Sanders Lectures |publisher=Magickal Childe |year=1984 |isbn=0-939708-05-1}}</ref> terminology that had originated with the occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour [[black]] should not necessarily have any associations with evil.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=321}}\n\nScholars of religion [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge|William Bainbridge]] claimed in 1985 that Wicca had \"reacted to [[secularisation]] by a headlong plunge back into magic\" and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out.

In Valiente's poem, they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy. Some lineaged Wiccans also observe a set of [[Wiccan Laws]], commonly called the ''Craft Laws'' or ''Ardanes'', 30 of which exist in the Gardnerian tradition and 161 of which are in the Alexandrian tradition. Valiente, one of Gardner's original High Priestesses, argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the by-product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven{{sfn|Valiente|1989|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Hutton|1999|}} \u2013 the others were later additions made by [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn British Traditional Wicca, \"sex complementarity is a basic and fundamental working principle\", with men and women being seen as a necessary presence to balance each other out.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=105}} This may have derived from Gardner's interpretation of Murray's claim that the ancient witch-cult was a fertility religion.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=105}} Thus, many practitioners of British Traditional Wicca have argued that gay men and women are not capable of correctly working magic without mixed-sex pairings.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=106}}\n\nAlthough Gerald Gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to [[Homosexuality and Wicca|homosexuality]], claiming that it brought down \"the curse of the goddess\",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|pp=69, 75}} it is now generally accepted in all traditions of Wicca, with groups such as the Minoan Brotherhood openly basing their philosophy upon it,{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=130\u2013131}} and various important figures in the Craft, such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Eddie Buczynski]], being openly homosexual or [[bisexual]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Joanne Pearson noted that in her experience, most Wiccans take a \"realistic view of living in the real world\" replete with its many problems and do not claim that the gods \"have all the answers\" to these.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=47}} She suggested that Wiccans do not claim to seek perfection but instead \"wholeness\" or \"completeness\", which includes an acceptance of traits like anger, weakness, and pain.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=49}} She contrasted the Wiccan acceptance of an \"interplay between light and dark\" against the New Age focus on \"white light\".{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=48}} Similarly, the scholar of religion Geoffrey Samuel noted that Wiccans devote \"a perhaps surprising amount of attention to darkness and death.\"{{sfn|Samuel|1998|p=128}}\n\nMany Wiccans are involved in environmentalist campaigns.{{sfn|Crowley|1998|p=178}}\n\n===Five elements===\n[[File:Five elements and pentagram.svg|upright|thumb|right|Five elements with pentagram]]\nMany traditions hold a belief in the five [[classical element]]s, although they are seen as symbolic as representations of the [[phase (matter)|phases of matter]].

For instance, those living on the east coast of [[North America]] should invoke water in the east and not the west because the colossal body of water, the [[Atlantic ocean]], is to their east.{{sfn|Lamond|2004|pp=88-89}} Other Craft groups have associated the elements with different cardinal points, for instance [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]'s Clan of Tubal Cain associated earth with south, fire with east, water with west and air with north,{{sfn|Valiente|1989|p=124}} and each of which were controlled over by a different deity who were seen as children of the primary Horned God and Goddess.

Often these take place on a [[full moon]], or in some cases a new moon, which is known as an [[Esbat]]. In typical rites, the coven or solitary assembles inside a ritually cast and purified [[magic circle]]. Casting the circle may involve the [[invocation]] of the \"Guardians\" of the cardinal points, alongside their respective classical elements; air, fire, water and earth. Once the circle is cast, a seasonal ritual may be performed, prayers to the God and Goddess are said, and spells are sometimes worked; these may include various forms of 'raising energy', including raising a [[cone of power]] for the purposes of sending healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn constructing his ritual system, Gardner drew upon older forms of ceremonial magic, in particular those found in the writings of Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Pearson|2007|p=5}}\n\nThe classical ritual scheme in [[British Traditional Wicca]] traditions is:{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1981}}\n# Purification of the sacred space and the participants\n# Casting the circle\n# Calling of the elemental quarters\n# Cone of power\n# Drawing down the Gods\n# Spellcasting\n# Great Rite\n# Wine, cakes, chanting, dancing, games\n# Farewell to the quarters and participants\n\nThese rites often include a special set of [[Magical tools in Wicca|magical tools]]. These usually include a knife called an [[athame]], a [[wand]], a [[pentacle]] and a [[chalice]], but other tools include a broomstick known as a [[Besom broom#In Wicca|besom]], a [[cauldron]], [[candle]]s, [[incense]] and a curved blade known as a [[boline]]. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the [[God]] and the [[Goddess]] may be displayed.{{sfn|Crowley|1989}} Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA central aspect of Wicca (particularly in Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca), often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude, also known as ''[[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]]''. This practice seemingly derives from a line in ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria|Aradia]]'', [[Charles Godfrey Leland|Charles Leland]]'s supposed record of Italian witchcraft.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches |publisher=David Nutt |first=Charles |last=Leland |author-link=Charles Leland |page=7 |year=1899|title-link=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches }}</ref> Many Wiccans believe that performing rituals skyclad allows \"power\" to flow from the body in a manner unimpeded by clothes.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}} Some also note that it removes signs of social rank and differentiation and thus encourages unity among the practitioners.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}} Some Wiccans seek legitimacy for the practice by stating that various ancient societies performed their rituals while nude.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}}\n\nOne of Wicca's best known liturgical texts is \"The Charge of the Goddess\".<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\"/> The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of [[Doreen Valiente]],<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\"/> who developed it from Gardner's version. Gardner's wording of the original \"Charge\" added extracts from the works of Aleister Crowley's work, including ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', (especially from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess) thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the principles of [[Thelema]]. Valiente rewrote Gardner's version in verse, keeping the material derived from ''Aradia'', but removing the material from Crowley.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guiley |first1=Rosemary Ellen |authorlink1=Rosemary Ellen Guiley |title=The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3849-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/52 52] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n===Sex magic===\n\nOther traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes. In certain traditions, ritualised [[sex magic]] is performed in the form of the [[Great Rite]], whereby a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess to possess them before performing [[sexual intercourse]] to raise magical energy for use in spellwork. In nearly all cases it is instead performed \"in token\", thereby merely symbolically, using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb.{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|pp=156\u2013174}}\n\nFor some Wiccans, the ritual space is a \"space of resistance, in which the sexual morals of Christianity and patriarchy can be subverted\", and for this reason they have adopted techniques from the [[BDSM]] subculture into their rituals.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=36}}\n\nPublicly, many Wiccan groups have tended to excise the role of sex magic from their image.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=32}} This has served both to escape the tabloid sensationalism that has targeted the religion since the 1950s and the concerns surrounding the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria in the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=32}}\n\n===Wheel of the Year===\n[[File:Wheel of the Year.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Painted Wheel of the Year at the [[Museum of Witchcraft]], [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]], displaying all eight of the Sabbats]]\n\n{{Main|Wheel of the Year}}\n\nWiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year, commonly known as [[Sabbats]].

Subsequently, when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s, many of the early groups, such as [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]'s Clan of Tubal Cain and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as ''Lesser Sabbats''. They are the [[solstice]]s and the [[equinox]]es, and they were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven,{{sfn|Lamond|2004|pp=16-17}} before they were subsequently adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition. They were eventually adopted by followers of other traditions like [[Alexandrian Wicca]] and the [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic]] tradition. The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] holidays. However, the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts, instead they exhibit a form of [[universalism]].

Perhaps the most significant of these is an [[initiation]] ritual, through which somebody joins the Craft and becomes a Wiccan. In [[British Traditional Wicca]]n (BTW) traditions, there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and from him is said to go back to the [[New Forest coven]]; however, the existence of this coven remains unproven.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |year=2005 |title=Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America |journal=Folklore |volume=116}}</ref> Gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of \"a year and a day\" between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated, although he frequently broke this rule with initiates.\n\nIn BTW, initiation only accepts someone into the first degree. To proceed to the second degree, an initiate has to go through another ceremony, in which they name and describe the uses of [[Magical tools in Wicca|the ritual tools and implements]]. It is also at this ceremony that they are given their [[craft name]]. By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens. The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves the participation of the [[Great Rite]], either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual [[flagellation]], which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones. By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|loc=Chapter II \u2013 Second Degree Initiation}}{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|loc=Chapter III \u2013 Third Degree Initiation}}\n\nAccording to new-age religious scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], in his book ''Witchcraft today: an encyclopaedia of Wiccan and neopagan traditions'', a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third-degree high priestess (in the orthodox Gardnerian system). She then becomes eligible to wear the \"moon crown\". The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage, and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of \"lineage papers\" proving the authenticity of her status.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/witchcrafttodaye0000lewi |url-access=registration |title=Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions |publisher=ABC-CLIO |first=James R. |last=Lewis |page=[https://archive.org/details/witchcrafttodaye0000lewi/page/238 238] |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57607-134-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|Handfasting ceremony at [[Avebury]] in [[England]], [[Beltane]] 2005]]\n\nThis three-tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to BTW, and traditions heavily based upon it. The [[Cochrane's Craft|Cochranian tradition]], which is not BTW, but based upon the teachings of [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], does not have the three degrees of initiation, merely having the stages of novice and initiate.\n\nSome solitary Wiccans also perform self-initiation rituals, to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan. The first of these to be published was in [[Paul Huson]]'s ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]'' (1970), and unusually involved recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical [[Witch Hunt]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Mastering Witchcraft: A Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks and Covens |publisher=Putnum |location=New York |first=Paul |last=Huson |year=1970 |pages=22\u201323 |oclc=79263 |isbn=0-595-42006-0}}</ref> Subsequent, more overtly pagan self-initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Scott Cunningham]] and [[Silver RavenWolf]].\n\n[[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|Handfasting]] is another celebration held by Wiccans, and is the commonly used term for their weddings. Some Wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day, which some traditions hold should be contracted on the Sabbat of Lughnasadh, as this was the traditional time for trial, \"[[Telltown]] marriages\" among the Irish. A common marriage vow in Wicca is \"for as long as love lasts\" instead of the traditional Christian \"till death do us part\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=370}} The first known Wiccan wedding ceremony took part in 1960 amongst the [[Bricket Wood coven]], between [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]] and his first wife, Gillian.{{sfn|Hutton|1999}}\n\nInfants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a [[Wiccaning]], which is analogous to a [[Infant baptism|Christening]].

Gerald Gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens, known as the [[Book of Shadows]] (among other names), which he would frequently add to and adapt. In his Book of Shadows, there are texts taken from various sources, including [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' (1899) and the works of 19th\u201320th century [[occultism|occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]], whom Gardner knew personally.

However, with the rise of more and more such groups, often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage, the term came to be a synonym for a [[religious denomination]] within Wicca.

Other traditions trace their origins to different figures, even if their beliefs and practices have been influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Gardner. These include [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the [[1734 Tradition]], both of which trace their origins to [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]; [[Feri Tradition|Feri]], which traces itself back to [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]] and [[Gwydion Pendderwen]]; and [[Dianic Wicca]], whose followers often trace their influences back to [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]].

Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven.

This growing demographic was soon catered to through the [[Internet]] and by authors like [[Silver RavenWolf]], much to the criticism of traditional Wiccan groups and individuals. In response to the way that Wicca was increasingly portrayed as trendy, eclectic, and influenced by the [[New Age]] movement, many Witches turned to the pre-Gardnerian origins of the Craft, and to the traditions of his rivals like Cardell and Cochrane, describing themselves as following \"[[traditional witchcraft]]\".

This symbol is generally placed on a Wiccan altar to honor the elements and directions.]]\n'''Wicca''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|\u02c8|w|\u026a|k|\u0259}}), also termed '''Pagan Witchcraft''', is a [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion. [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] categorise it as both a [[new religious movement]] and as part of the [[occultism|occultist]] stream of [[Western esotericism]]. It was developed in [[England]] during the first half of the 20th century and was [[Witchcraft Today|introduced to the public]] in 1954 by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil servant]]. Wicca draws upon a diverse set of [[paganism|ancient pagan]] and [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|20th-century hermetic]] [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]]s for its [[theology|theological]] structure and [[ritual]] practices.\n\nWicca has no central authority figure. Its traditional core beliefs, principles and practices were originally outlined in the 1940s and 1950s by Gardner and [[Doreen Valiente]], both in published books and in secret written and oral teachings passed along to their initiates. There are many variations on the core structure, and the religion grows and evolves over time. It is divided into a number of diverse lineages, [[sect]]s and [[Religious denomination|denominations]], referred to as ''traditions'', each with its own [[organisational structure]] and level of [[centralisation]]. Due to its decentralized nature, there is some disagreement over what actually constitutes Wicca. Some traditions, collectively referred to as [[British Traditional Wicca]], strictly follow the initiatory lineage of Gardner and consider the term ''Wicca'' to apply only to similar traditions, but not to newer, [[#Eclectic Wicca|eclectic]] traditions.\n\nWicca is typically [[duotheism|duotheistic]], worshipping a Goddess and a God. These are traditionally viewed as the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], respectively. These deities may be regarded in a [[henotheism|henotheistic]] way, as having many different divine aspects which can in turn be identified with many diverse pagan deities from different historical pantheons. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as the \"Great Goddess\" and the \"Great Horned God\", with the adjective \"great\" connoting a deity that contains many other deities within their own nature. These two deities are sometimes viewed as facets of a greater [[pantheism|pantheistic]] [[divinity]], which is regarded as an impersonal force or process rather than a personal deity. While [[duotheism]] or bitheism is traditional in Wicca, broader Wiccan beliefs range from [[polytheism]] to [[pantheism]] or [[monism]], even to [[Goddess movement|Goddess monotheism]].\n\nWiccan celebrations encompass both the [[lunar phase|cycles of the Moon]], known as [[Esbat]]s and commonly associated with the Goddess (female deity), and the cycles of the Sun, seasonally based festivals known as [[Sabbat]]s and commonly associated with the Horned God (male deity). An unattributed statement known as the [[Wiccan Rede]] is a popular expression of Wiccan morality, although it is not universally accepted by Wiccans. Wicca often involves the ritual practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], though it is not always necessary.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definition and terminology==\n{{Main|Etymology of Wicca}}\n[[File:Wiccan priestess preaching, USA.PNG|thumb|Wiccan priestess preaching in USA]]\nScholars of [[religious studies]] classify Wicca as a [[new religious movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=87|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=5}} and more specifically as a form of [[modern Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Crowley|1y=1998|1p=170|2a1=Pearson|2y=2002|2p=44|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=2}} Cited as the largest,{{sfnm|1a1=Strmiska|1y=2005|1p=47|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2010|2p=185}} best known,{{sfnm|1a1=Strmiska|1y=2005|1p=2|2a1=Rountree|2y=2015|2p=4}} most influential,{{sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=185}} and most extensively academically studied form of Paganism,{{sfn|Strmiska|2005|p=2}} within the movement it has been identified as sitting on the former end of the [[Modern Paganism#Eclecticism and Reconstructionism|eclectic to reconstructionist spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Strmiska|1y=2005|1p=21|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=7}}\nSeveral academics have also categorised Wicca as a form of [[nature religion]], a term that is also embraced by many of its practitioners,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenwood|1y=1998|1pp=101, 102|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=8}} and as a [[mystery religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ezzy|1y=2002|1p=117|2a1=Hutton|2y=2002|2p=172}} However, given that Wicca also incorporates the practice of [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], several scholars have referred to it as a \"magico-religion\".{{sfnm|1a1=Orion|1y=1994|1p=6|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=5}} Wicca is also a form of [[Western esotericism]], and more specifically a part of the esoteric current known as [[occultism]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}} Academics like Wouter Hanegraaff and Tanya Luhrmann have categorised Wicca as part of the [[New Age]], although other academics, and many Wiccans themselves, dispute this categorisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Pearson|1y=1998|1p=45|2a1=Ezzy|2y=2003|2pp=49\u201350}}\n\nAlthough recognised as a [[religion]] by academics, some [[Evangelical Christianity|evangelical Christians]] have attempted to deny it legal recognition as such, while some Wiccan practitioners themselves eschew the term \"religion\" \u2013 associating the latter purely with [[organised religion]] \u2013 instead favouring \"[[spirituality]]\" or \"way of life\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=5}} Although Wicca as a religion is distinct from other forms of contemporary Paganism, there has been much \"cross-fertilization\" between these different Pagan faiths; accordingly, Wicca has both influenced and been influenced by other Pagan religions, thus making clear-cut distinctions between them more difficult for religious studies scholars to make.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=7}}\nThe terms ''wizard'' and ''warlock'' are generally discouraged in the community.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|p=36}}\nIn Wicca, [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s are referred to as ''traditions'',{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=5}} while non-Wiccans are often termed ''cowans''.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=1}}\n\n===\"Witchcraft\" and \"Wicca\"===\n\nWhen the religion first came to public attention, it was commonly called \"Witchcraft\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=4}}{{efn|Scholars of contemporary Paganism usually capitalise \"Witchcraft\" when referring to Wicca, reflecting that the names of religion are typically capitalised.{{sfn|Rountree|2015|p=19}} Many Wiccan practitioners also do the same.{{sfn|Crowley|1998|p=171}} }} For instance, [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]\u2014the man regarded as the \"Father of Wicca\"\u2014referred to it as the \"Craft of the Wise\", \"witchcraft\", and \"the witch-cult\" during the 1950s.{{sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=188}} There is no evidence that he ever called it \"Wicca\", although he did refer to the collective community of Pagan Witches as \"the Wica\" (with one ''c'').{{sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=188}} As a name for the religion, \"Wicca\" developed in Britain during the 1960s.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=5}} It is not known who precisely invented the term \"Wicca\" in reference to the religion, although one possibility is that it might have been Gardner's rival [[Charles Cardell]], who was referring to it as the \"Craft of the Wiccens\" by 1958.{{sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=190}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica_or_wicca.htm |title=Wica or Wicca?

she claimed that whereas the cult as recorded in the Early Modern witch trials had venerated a Horned God, centuries before it had also worshipped a Mother Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=87}} This duotheistic Horned God/Mother Goddess structure was embraced by Gardner \u2013 who claimed that it had Stone Age roots \u2013 and remains the underlying theological basis to his Gardnerian tradition.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=87\u201388}} Gardner claimed that the names of these deities were to be kept secret within the tradition, although in 1964 they were publicly revealed to be Cernunnos and Aradia; the secret Gardnerian deity names were subsequently changed.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=91}}\n\nAlthough different Wiccans attribute different traits to the Horned God, he is most often associated with animals and the natural world, but also with the afterlife, and he is furthermore often viewed as an ideal role model for men.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=88}} The Mother Goddess has been associated with life, fertility, and the springtime, and has been described as an ideal role model for women.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=89}} Wicca's duotheism has been compared to the [[Taoism|Taoist]] system of [[yin and yang]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=87}}\n\nOther Wiccans have adopted the original Gardnerian God/Goddess duotheistic structure but have adopted deity forms other than that of the Horned God and Mother Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=89\u201390}} For instance, the God has been interpreted as the [[Oak King]] and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]], as well as the Sun God, Son/Lover God, and Vegetation God.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}} He has also been seen in the roles of the [[Wild Hunt#Leader of the Wild Hunt|Leader of the Wild Hunt]] and the Lord of Death.<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pearson |first=Joanne E. |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Lindsay |title=Wicca |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |volume=14 |pages=9730 |publisher=Macmaillan Reference USA |location=Detroit |year=2005}}</ref> The Goddess is often portrayed as a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], thereby being a triadic deity comprising a Maiden goddess, a [[Mother goddess]], and a Crone goddess, each of whom has different associations, namely virginity, fertility and wisdom.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}}{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1987|pp=29\u201337}} Other Wiccan conceptualisations have portrayed her as a [[lunar deity|Moon Goddess]] and as a Menstruating Goddess.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=90}} According to the anthropologist Susan Greenwood, in Wicca the Goddess is \"a symbol of self-transformation - she is seen to be constantly changing and a force for change for those who open themselves up to her.\"{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=103}}\n\n====Monotheism and polytheism====\n\nGardner stated that beyond Wicca's two deities was the \"Supreme Deity\" or \"[[unmoved mover|Prime Mover]]\", an entity that was too complex for humans to understand.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} This belief has been endorsed by other prominent practitioners, who have referred to it as \"the Cosmic Logos\", \"Supreme Cosmic Power\", or \"Godhead\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} Gardner envisioned this Supreme Deity as a [[deism|deist]] entity who had created the \"Under-Gods\", among them the God and Goddess, but who was not otherwise involved in the world; alternately, other Wiccans have interpreted such an entity as a pantheistic being, of whom the God and Goddess are facets.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n[[File:Horned God.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Sculpture of the Horned God of Wicca found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]]]]\n\nAlthough Gardner criticised monotheism, citing the [[Problem of Evil]],{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=92}} explicitly monotheistic forms of Wicca developed in the 1960s, when the U.S.-based [[Church of Wicca]] developed a theology rooted in the worship of what they described as \"one deity, without gender\".{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=93}} In the 1970s, Dianic Wiccan groups developed which were devoted to a singular, monotheistic Goddess; this approach was often criticised by members of British Traditional Wiccan groups, who lambasted such Goddess monotheism as an inverted imitation of Christian theology.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=94}} As in other forms of Wicca, some Goddess monotheists have expressed the view that the Goddess is not an entity with a literal existence, but rather a Jungian archetype.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=95}}\n\nAs well as pantheism and duotheism, many Wiccans accept the concept of [[polytheism]], thereby believing that there are many different deities. Some accept the view espoused by the occultist [[Dion Fortune]] that \"all gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess\" \u2013 that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are, respectively, aspects of one supernal God and Goddess. With this mindset, a Wiccan may regard the Germanic [[\u0112ostre]], Hindu [[Kali]], and Catholic [[Virgin Mary]] each as manifestations of one supreme Goddess and likewise, the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], the ancient Greek [[Dionysus]] and the Judeo-Christian [[Yahweh]] as aspects of a single, archetypal god. A more strictly [[polytheism|polytheistic]] approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right. The Wiccan writers [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Gavin Bone]] have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview.{{sfn|Farrar|Bone|2004}} Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical [[archetype]]s or [[thoughtform]]s, thereby technically allowing them to be [[atheism|atheists]].{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=25, 34\u201335}} Such a view was purported by the High Priestess [[Vivianne Crowley]], herself a [[psychology|psychologist]], who considered the Wiccan deities to be [[Jungian archetypes]] that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual. It was for this reason that she said that \"The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision.\"<ref name=\"Crowleyarchetype\">{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |authorlink=Vivianne Crowley |title=Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Millennium |publisher=Thorsons |location=London |page=129 |year=1996 |isbn=0-7225-3271-7 |oclc=34190941}}</ref>\nWiccans often believe that the gods are not perfect and can be argued with.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=52}}\n\nMany Wiccans also adopt a more explicitly polytheistic or [[animism|animistic]] world-view of the universe as being replete with spirit-beings.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|pp=95\u201396}} In many cases these spirits are associated with the natural world, for instance as ''[[genius loci]]'', [[fairies]], and [[elementals]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=96}} In other cases, such beliefs are more idiosyncratic and atypical; the prominent Wiccan [[Sybil Leek]] for instance endorsed a belief in [[angel]]s.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=96}}\n\n===Afterlife===\n[[File:Wiccan altar for Beltane in Wales.png|thumb|A Wiccan altar decorated to mark the festival of [[Beltane]] (30 April/1 May)]]\nBelief in the afterlife varies among Wiccans and does not occupy a central place within the religion.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} As the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] remarked, \"the instinctual position of most [Wiccans]&nbsp;... seems to be that if one makes the most of the present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present\".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=393}} Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife,{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=148}} it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from [[Hawaiian religion]] that the human being has three souls.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}}\n\nAlthough not accepted by all Wiccans, a belief in [[reincarnation]] is the dominant afterlife belief within Wicca, having been originally espoused by Gardner.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} Understandings of how the cycle of reincarnation operates differ among practitioners; the prominent Wiccan [[Raymond Buckland]] for instance insisted that human souls would only incarnate into human bodies, whereas other Wiccans believe that a human soul can incarnate into any life form.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=147}} There is also a common Wiccan belief that any Witches will come to be reincarnated as future Witches, an idea originally expressed by Gardner.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=147}} Gardner also articulated the view that the human soul rested for a period between bodily death and its incarnation, with this resting place commonly being referred to as \"[[The Summerland]]\" among the Wiccan community.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}} This allows many Wiccans to believe that [[Mediumship|mediums]] are able to contact the spirits of the deceased, a belief adopted from [[Spiritualism]].{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=146}}\n\n===Magic===\nMany Wiccans believe in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], a manipulative force exercised through the practice of [[witchcraft]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. Many Wiccans agree with the definition of magic offered by [[ceremonial magic]]ians,{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} such as [[Aleister Crowley]], who declared that magic was \"the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will\", while another prominent ceremonial magician, [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]] stated that it was \"the science of the control of the secret forces of nature\".{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} Many Wiccans believe magic to be a law of nature, as yet misunderstood or disregarded by contemporary science,{{sfn|Valiente|1973|p=231}} and as such they do not view it as being [[supernatural]], but a part of what [[Leo Martello]] calls the \"super powers that reside in the natural\".{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=158\u2013159}} Some Wiccans believe that magic is simply making full use of the five senses in order to achieve surprising results,{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=158\u2013159}} whilst other Wiccans do not claim to know how magic works, merely believing that it does because they have observed it to be so.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=394\u2013395}} Some spell it \"magick\", a variation coined by the influential occultist Aleister Crowley, though this spelling is more commonly associated with Crowley's religion of [[Thelema]] than with Wicca.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nDuring ritual practices, which are often staged in a [[sacred circle]], Wiccans cast [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] or \"workings\" intended to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for [[energy medicine|healing]], for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|pp=250\u2013265}} Many early Wiccans, such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], [[Sybil Leek]] and [[Alex Winfield]], referred to their own magic as \"[[magic (paranormal)|white magic]]\", which contrasted with \"[[black magic]]\", which they associated with [[evil]] and [[Satanism]]. Sanders also used the similar terminology of \"[[left hand path]]\" to describe malevolent magic, and \"[[right hand path]]\" to describe magic performed with good intentions;<ref>{{cite book |first=Alex |last=Sanders |authorlink=Alex Sanders (Wiccan) |title=The Alex Sanders Lectures |publisher=Magickal Childe |year=1984 |isbn=0-939708-05-1}}</ref> terminology that had originated with the occultist [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the colour [[black]] should not necessarily have any associations with evil.{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=321}}\n\nScholars of religion [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge|William Bainbridge]] claimed in 1985 that Wicca had \"reacted to [[secularisation]] by a headlong plunge back into magic\" and that it was a reactionary religion which would soon die out. This view was heavily criticised in 1999 by the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] who claimed that the evidence displayed the very opposite: that \"a large number [of Wiccans] were in jobs at the cutting edge [of scientific culture], such as computer technology.\"{{sfn|Hutton|1999}}\n\n===Witchcraft===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"Identification as a witch can[\u2026] provide a link to those persecuted and executed in the Great Witch Hunt, which can then be remembered as a holocaust against women, a repackaging of history that implies conscious victimization and the appropriation of 'holocaust' as a badge of honour \u2014 'gendercide rather than genocide'.

In Valiente's poem, they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy. Some lineaged Wiccans also observe a set of [[Wiccan Laws]], commonly called the ''Craft Laws'' or ''Ardanes'', 30 of which exist in the Gardnerian tradition and 161 of which are in the Alexandrian tradition. Valiente, one of Gardner's original High Priestesses, argued that the first thirty of these rules were most likely invented by Gerald Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the by-product of inner conflict within his Bricket Wood coven{{sfn|Valiente|1989|pp=70\u201371}}{{sfn|Hutton|1999|}} \u2013 the others were later additions made by [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn British Traditional Wicca, \"sex complementarity is a basic and fundamental working principle\", with men and women being seen as a necessary presence to balance each other out.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=105}} This may have derived from Gardner's interpretation of Murray's claim that the ancient witch-cult was a fertility religion.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=105}} Thus, many practitioners of British Traditional Wicca have argued that gay men and women are not capable of correctly working magic without mixed-sex pairings.{{sfn|Greenwood|1998|p=106}}\n\nAlthough Gerald Gardner initially demonstrated an aversion to [[Homosexuality and Wicca|homosexuality]], claiming that it brought down \"the curse of the goddess\",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|pp=69, 75}} it is now generally accepted in all traditions of Wicca, with groups such as the Minoan Brotherhood openly basing their philosophy upon it,{{sfn|Adler|1979|pp=130\u2013131}} and various important figures in the Craft, such as [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and [[Eddie Buczynski]], being openly homosexual or [[bisexual]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe scholar of religion Joanne Pearson noted that in her experience, most Wiccans take a \"realistic view of living in the real world\" replete with its many problems and do not claim that the gods \"have all the answers\" to these.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=47}} She suggested that Wiccans do not claim to seek perfection but instead \"wholeness\" or \"completeness\", which includes an acceptance of traits like anger, weakness, and pain.{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=49}} She contrasted the Wiccan acceptance of an \"interplay between light and dark\" against the New Age focus on \"white light\".{{sfn|Pearson|1998|p=48}} Similarly, the scholar of religion Geoffrey Samuel noted that Wiccans devote \"a perhaps surprising amount of attention to darkness and death.\"{{sfn|Samuel|1998|p=128}}\n\nMany Wiccans are involved in environmentalist campaigns.{{sfn|Crowley|1998|p=178}}\n\n===Five elements===\n[[File:Five elements and pentagram.svg|upright|thumb|right|Five elements with pentagram]]\nMany traditions hold a belief in the five [[classical element]]s, although they are seen as symbolic as representations of the [[phase (matter)|phases of matter]].

Once the circle is cast, a seasonal ritual may be performed, prayers to the God and Goddess are said, and spells are sometimes worked; these may include various forms of 'raising energy', including raising a [[cone of power]] for the purposes of sending healing or other magic to persons outside of the sacred space.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn constructing his ritual system, Gardner drew upon older forms of ceremonial magic, in particular those found in the writings of Aleister Crowley.{{sfn|Pearson|2007|p=5}}\n\nThe classical ritual scheme in [[British Traditional Wicca]] traditions is:{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1981}}\n# Purification of the sacred space and the participants\n# Casting the circle\n# Calling of the elemental quarters\n# Cone of power\n# Drawing down the Gods\n# Spellcasting\n# Great Rite\n# Wine, cakes, chanting, dancing, games\n# Farewell to the quarters and participants\n\nThese rites often include a special set of [[Magical tools in Wicca|magical tools]]. These usually include a knife called an [[athame]], a [[wand]], a [[pentacle]] and a [[chalice]], but other tools include a broomstick known as a [[Besom broom#In Wicca|besom]], a [[cauldron]], [[candle]]s, [[incense]] and a curved blade known as a [[boline]]. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and representations of the [[God]] and the [[Goddess]] may be displayed.{{sfn|Crowley|1989}} Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA central aspect of Wicca (particularly in Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca), often sensationalised by the media is the traditional practice of working in the nude, also known as ''[[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]]''. This practice seemingly derives from a line in ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria|Aradia]]'', [[Charles Godfrey Leland|Charles Leland]]'s supposed record of Italian witchcraft.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches |publisher=David Nutt |first=Charles |last=Leland |author-link=Charles Leland |page=7 |year=1899|title-link=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches }}</ref> Many Wiccans believe that performing rituals skyclad allows \"power\" to flow from the body in a manner unimpeded by clothes.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}} Some also note that it removes signs of social rank and differentiation and thus encourages unity among the practitioners.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}} Some Wiccans seek legitimacy for the practice by stating that various ancient societies performed their rituals while nude.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=157}}\n\nOne of Wicca's best known liturgical texts is \"The Charge of the Goddess\".<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\"/> The most commonly used version used by Wiccans today is the rescension of [[Doreen Valiente]],<ref name=\"Pearson 2005 9730\"/> who developed it from Gardner's version. Gardner's wording of the original \"Charge\" added extracts from the works of Aleister Crowley's work, including ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', (especially from Ch 1, spoken by Nuit, the Star Goddess) thus linking modern Wicca irrevocably to the principles of [[Thelema]]. Valiente rewrote Gardner's version in verse, keeping the material derived from ''Aradia'', but removing the material from Crowley.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guiley |first1=Rosemary Ellen |authorlink1=Rosemary Ellen Guiley |title=The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3849-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/52 52] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n===Sex magic===\n\nOther traditions wear robes with cords tied around the waist or even normal street clothes. In certain traditions, ritualised [[sex magic]] is performed in the form of the [[Great Rite]], whereby a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess to possess them before performing [[sexual intercourse]] to raise magical energy for use in spellwork. In nearly all cases it is instead performed \"in token\", thereby merely symbolically, using the athame to symbolise the penis and the chalice to symbolise the womb.{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|pp=156\u2013174}}\n\nFor some Wiccans, the ritual space is a \"space of resistance, in which the sexual morals of Christianity and patriarchy can be subverted\", and for this reason they have adopted techniques from the [[BDSM]] subculture into their rituals.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=36}}\n\nPublicly, many Wiccan groups have tended to excise the role of sex magic from their image.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=32}} This has served both to escape the tabloid sensationalism that has targeted the religion since the 1950s and the concerns surrounding the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] hysteria in the 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Pearson|2005|p=32}}\n\n===Wheel of the Year===\n[[File:Wheel of the Year.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Painted Wheel of the Year at the [[Museum of Witchcraft]], [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]], displaying all eight of the Sabbats]]\n\n{{Main|Wheel of the Year}}\n\nWiccans celebrate several seasonal festivals of the year, commonly known as [[Sabbats]].

Subsequently, when Wicca was first developing in the 1930s through to the 1960s, many of the early groups, such as [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]'s Clan of Tubal Cain and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] adopted the commemoration of these four Sabbats as described by Murray.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe other four festivals commemorated by many Wiccans are known as ''Lesser Sabbats''. They are the [[solstice]]s and the [[equinox]]es, and they were only adopted in 1958 by members of the Bricket Wood coven,{{sfn|Lamond|2004|pp=16-17}} before they were subsequently adopted by other followers of the Gardnerian tradition. They were eventually adopted by followers of other traditions like [[Alexandrian Wicca]] and the [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic]] tradition. The names of these holidays that are commonly used today are often taken from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic pagan]] holidays. However, the festivals are not reconstructive in nature nor do they often resemble their historical counterparts, instead they exhibit a form of [[universalism]]. The rituals that are observed may display cultural influences from the holidays from which they take their names as well as influences from other unrelated cultures.{{sfn|Crowley|1989|p=23}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; width: 100%\"\n|-\n!Sabbat\n!Northern Hemisphere\n!Southern Hemisphere\n!Origin of Name\n!Associations\n|-\n|[[Samhain]], a.k.a.

Perhaps the most significant of these is an [[initiation]] ritual, through which somebody joins the Craft and becomes a Wiccan. In [[British Traditional Wicca]]n (BTW) traditions, there is a line of initiatory descent that goes back to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], and from him is said to go back to the [[New Forest coven]]; however, the existence of this coven remains unproven.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |year=2005 |title=Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America |journal=Folklore |volume=116}}</ref> Gardner himself claimed that there was a traditional length of \"a year and a day\" between when a person began studying the Craft and when they were initiated, although he frequently broke this rule with initiates.\n\nIn BTW, initiation only accepts someone into the first degree. To proceed to the second degree, an initiate has to go through another ceremony, in which they name and describe the uses of [[Magical tools in Wicca|the ritual tools and implements]]. It is also at this ceremony that they are given their [[craft name]]. By holding the rank of second degree, a BTW is considered capable of initiating others into the Craft, or founding their own semi-autonomous covens. The third degree is the highest in BTW, and it involves the participation of the [[Great Rite]], either actual or symbolically, and in some cases ritual [[flagellation]], which is a rite often dispensed with due to its sado-masochistic overtones. By holding this rank, an initiate is considered capable of forming covens that are entirely autonomous of their parent coven.{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|loc=Chapter II \u2013 Second Degree Initiation}}{{sfn|Farrar|Farrar|1984|loc=Chapter III \u2013 Third Degree Initiation}}\n\nAccording to new-age religious scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], in his book ''Witchcraft today: an encyclopaedia of Wiccan and neopagan traditions'', a high priestess becomes a queen when she has successfully hived off her first new coven under a new third-degree high priestess (in the orthodox Gardnerian system). She then becomes eligible to wear the \"moon crown\". The sequence of high priestess and queens traced back to Gerald Gardner is known as a lineage, and every orthodox Gardnerian High Priestess has a set of \"lineage papers\" proving the authenticity of her status.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/witchcrafttodaye0000lewi |url-access=registration |title=Witchcraft Today: An Encyclopedia of Wiccan and Neopagan Traditions |publisher=ABC-CLIO |first=James R. |last=Lewis |page=[https://archive.org/details/witchcrafttodaye0000lewi/page/238 238] |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-57607-134-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|Handfasting ceremony at [[Avebury]] in [[England]], [[Beltane]] 2005]]\n\nThis three-tier degree system following initiation is largely unique to BTW, and traditions heavily based upon it. The [[Cochrane's Craft|Cochranian tradition]], which is not BTW, but based upon the teachings of [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], does not have the three degrees of initiation, merely having the stages of novice and initiate.\n\nSome solitary Wiccans also perform self-initiation rituals, to dedicate themselves to becoming a Wiccan. The first of these to be published was in [[Paul Huson]]'s ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]'' (1970), and unusually involved recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] backwards as a symbol of defiance against the historical [[Witch Hunt]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Mastering Witchcraft: A Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks and Covens |publisher=Putnum |location=New York |first=Paul |last=Huson |year=1970 |pages=22\u201323 |oclc=79263 |isbn=0-595-42006-0}}</ref> Subsequent, more overtly pagan self-initiation rituals have since been published in books designed for solitary Wiccans by authors like [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Scott Cunningham]] and [[Silver RavenWolf]].\n\n[[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|Handfasting]] is another celebration held by Wiccans, and is the commonly used term for their weddings. Some Wiccans observe the practice of a trial marriage for a year and a day, which some traditions hold should be contracted on the Sabbat of Lughnasadh, as this was the traditional time for trial, \"[[Telltown]] marriages\" among the Irish. A common marriage vow in Wicca is \"for as long as love lasts\" instead of the traditional Christian \"till death do us part\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|p=370}} The first known Wiccan wedding ceremony took part in 1960 amongst the [[Bricket Wood coven]], between [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]] and his first wife, Gillian.{{sfn|Hutton|1999}}\n\nInfants in Wiccan families may be involved in a ritual called a [[Wiccaning]], which is analogous to a [[Infant baptism|Christening]]. The purpose of this is to present the infant to the God and Goddess for protection. Parents are advised to \"give {{interp|their}} children the gift of Wicca\" in a manner suitable to their age. In accordance with the importance put on free will in Wicca, the child is not expected or required to adhere to Wicca or other forms of paganism should they not wish to do so when they reach adulthood.<ref name=\"AmberK1998\">{{cite book |title=Coven Craft: Witchcraft for Three or More |publisher=Llewellyn |first=Amber |last=K. |page=280 |year=1998 |isbn=1-56718-018-3}}</ref>\n\n===Book of Shadows===\n{{Main|Book of Shadows}}\n[[File:Wiccan 'Book of Shadows'.jpg|thumb|A 'Book of Shadows', sitting on a wiccan altar, alongside plants and crystals.]]\nIn Wicca, there is no set sacred text such as the Christian [[Bible]], Jewish [[Tanakh]], Hindu [[Gita]] or Islamic [[Quran]], although there are certain scriptures and texts that various traditions hold to be important and influence their beliefs and practices. Gerald Gardner used a book containing many different texts in his covens, known as the [[Book of Shadows]] (among other names), which he would frequently add to and adapt. In his Book of Shadows, there are texts taken from various sources, including [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' (1899) and the works of 19th\u201320th century [[occultism|occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]], whom Gardner knew personally.

Gardner's original intention was that every copy of the Book would be different, because a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the [[United States]], all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess [[Monique Wilson (witch)|Monique Wilson]] copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered.

However, with the rise of more and more such groups, often being founded by those with no previous initiatory lineage, the term came to be a synonym for a [[religious denomination]] within Wicca. There are many such traditions<ref name=\"BeaufortIndex\">{{cite web |url=http://beaufort.bravepages.com/ |title=Beaufort House Index of English Traditional Witchcraft |work=Beaufort House Association |date=15 January 1999 |accessdate=2 April 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"DiffTypesCraft\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hexarchive.com/wicca/witchcraft.htm |title=Different types of Witchcraft |work=Hex Archive |accessdate=2 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618161438/http://www.hexarchive.com/wicca/witchcraft.htm |archive-date=18 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and there are also many [[solitary practitioner]]s who do not align themselves with any particular lineage, working alone. There are also covens that have formed but who do not follow any particular tradition, instead choosing their influences and practices eclectically.\n\nThose traditions which trace a line of initiatory descent back to Gerald Gardner include [[Gardnerian Wicca]], [[Alexandrian Wicca]] and the [[Algard]] tradition; because of their joint history, they are often referred to as [[British Traditional Wicca]], particularly in [[North America]]. Other traditions trace their origins to different figures, even if their beliefs and practices have been influenced to a greater or lesser extent by Gardner. These include [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the [[1734 Tradition]], both of which trace their origins to [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]; [[Feri Tradition|Feri]], which traces itself back to [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]] and [[Gwydion Pendderwen]]; and [[Dianic Wicca]], whose followers often trace their influences back to [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]]. Some of these groups prefer to refer to themselves as ''Witches'', thereby distinguishing themselves from the BTW traditions, who more typically use the term ''Wiccan'' (see [[Wicca#Etymology|Etymology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} During the 1980s, Viviane Crowley, an initiate of both the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions, merged the two.{{sfn|Pearson|2007|p=2}}\n\nPearson noted that \"Wicca has evolved and, at times, mutated quite dramatically into completely different forms\".{{sfn|Pearson|2007|p=3}}\nWicca has also been \"customized\" to the various different national contexts into which it has been introduced; for instance, in Ireland, the veneration of ancient Irish deities has been incorporated into Wicca.{{sfn|Rountree|2015|p=16}}\n\n===Covens===\nLineaged Wicca is organised into [[coven]]s of initiated priests and priestesses. Covens are autonomous, and are generally headed by a High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership, being a couple who have each been through their first, second and third degrees of initiation. Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come under the rule of the parent coven. Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment, but this is not a necessity, and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven.{{sfn|Buckland|1986|pp=17, 18, 53}} Most covens would not admit members under the age of 18.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=142}} They often do not advertise their existence, and when they do, do so through Pagan magazines.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=138}} Some organise courses and workshops through which prospective members can come along and be assessed.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=139}}\n\n[[File:Pagan Witchcraft Altar.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Pagan witchcraft altar]]\n\nA commonly quoted Wiccan tradition holds that the ideal number of members for a coven is [[13 (number)|thirteen]], though this is not held as a hard-and-fast rule.{{sfn|Buckland|1986|pp=17, 18, 53}} Indeed, many U.S. covens are far smaller, though the membership may be augmented by unaffiliated Wiccans at \"open\" rituals.<ref>{{cite book |title=Covencraft: Witchcraft for Three or More |publisher=Llewellyn |first=Amber |last=K. |page=228 |date=1998 |isbn=1-56718-018-3}}</ref> Pearson noted that covens typically contained between five and ten initiates.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=136}} They generally avoid mass recruitment due to the feasibility of finding spaces large enough to bring together greater numbers for rituals and because larger numbers inhibit the sense of intimacy and trust that covens utilise.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=136}}\n\nSome covens are short-lived but others have survived for many years.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=136}}\nCovens in the Reclaiming tradition are often single sex and non-hierarchical in structure.{{sfn|Salomonsen|1998|p=143}} Coven members who leave their original group to form another, separate coven are described as having \"hived off\" in Wicca.{{sfn|Pearson|2002b|p=136}}\n\nInitiation into a coven is traditionally preceded by an apprenticeship period of a year and a day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guiley |first1=Rosemary Ellen |authorlink1=Rosemary Ellen Guiley |title=The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3849-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/169 169] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwi00guil/page/169 }}</ref> A course of study may be set during this period.

From these humble beginnings, this radical religion spread to the United States, where it found a comfortable bedfellow in the form of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counter-culture]] and came to be championed by those sectors of the [[Women's liberation movement|women's]] and [[gay liberation]] movements which were seeking a spiritual escape from Christian hegemony.\"|source=\u2014 Religious studies scholar Ethan Doyle White{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=2}} }}\n\nWicca was founded in England between 1921 and 1950,{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=14}} representing what the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] called \"the only full-formed religion which England can be said to have given the world\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=2003|1pp=279\u2013230|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=14}} Characterised as an \"[[invented tradition]]\" by scholars,{{sfnm|1a1=Baker|1y=1996|1p=187|2a1=Magliocco|2y=1996|2p=94|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=14}} Wicca was created from the patchwork adoption of various older elements, many taken from pre-existing religious and esoteric movements.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=13}} Pearson characterised it as having arisen \"from the cultural impulses of the ''fin de si\u00e8cle''\".{{sfn|Pearson|2002|p=32}}\n\nWicca took as its basis the [[witch-cult hypothesis]].

He claimed to have been [[initiation|initiated]] into a [[New Forest coven|witches' coven]] in [[New Forest District|New Forest]], [[Hampshire]], in the late 1930s.

She and her sister Sara would spend the first half on her maternal grandmother's North Carolina tobacco farm and the second half in a starkly different world of chauffeurs and house servants among the elite of Atlanta, Georgia. Her paternal grandmother, also named Sara McKinney, was a friend of [[Margaret Mitchell]] and other society women, she told Lamb. \"We'd spend every day at someone's pool or country club,\" Highsmith said. \"Opera played on the radio. Grandmother taught us manners and etiquette\u2014to sit up straight, eat with our mouths closed, hold the soup spoon just so.\"<ref name=\"c-spanvideo.org\"/>\n[[File:Log cabins where photographer Carol M.

But grandmother's friends made like nothing had happened. They'd have her to dinner, play bridge and canasta, even take her on cruises to Europe and have their chauffeurs drive her as if she were still part of the aristocracy.\"<ref name=\"c-spanvideo.org\"/>\n\nHighsmith told C-Span that the influence of her father, a traveling salesman, and her own annual travels through several states to reach her grandmothers imbued her with a fascination about America, \"especially roadside America. The old car in which my mother would drive Sara and me South would break down every year, it seemed, in little towns. We'd have to stay overnight in little motels and above the kinds of old gas stations I love to photograph today.\"<ref name=\"c-spanvideo.org\"/>\n\nIn February 2012, Carol Highsmith returned to her birth city in North Carolina to record a tape about her childhood experiences that would be played four months later at the opening of the [[Rockingham County Courthouse (North Carolina)|Museum and Archives of Rockingham County (MARC)]] in [[Wentworth, North Carolina]].

The article, by Dawn DeCwikiel-Kane, included Highsmith's reflection on the significance of her (then) 25-year donation of more than 42,000 images to the Library of Congress: \"'It's my legacy,' she said. \"But it's our [nation's] legacy.'\" The story, entitled \"America's Photographer,\" won a 2017 first-place award in the Profile Feature category in an annual contest sponsored by the North Carolina Press Association.<ref>http://cdn1.creativecirclemedia.com/ncpress/files/9eb554fc04.pdf</ref>\n\nCarol Highsmith (then McKinney) graduated from [[Minnehaha Academy]] in Minneapolis in 1964, then spent a year in college at the now-defunct [[Parsons College]] in [[Fairfield, Iowa]]. In a 2013 profile of Highsmith, the Minnehaha Academy alumni magazine, the \"Arrow,\" quoted Highsmith:\n\n{{quote|The 1960s were a magical time. They remind me of what I've read about the liberating, transitional 1920s. We were at the right age to be profoundly affected by the churning changes in our times. Little did we know how profound and lasting would be the effects of the civil rights movement, landing a man on the moon, the rock'n'roll revolution, the Vietnam War and the protests against it, the social and counterculture movement, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kennedy Brothers. I am the driven, creative, and somewhat unpredictable person I am partly because of those rebellious times, framed against the backdrop of solid, values-oriented Midwest surroundings.\n\nWhen I attended Minnehaha Academy, I was voted Most Mischievous!  Perhaps there's a lesson there\u2014that anyone, even average, fun-loving students, can achieve a life of substance, given determination and half a chance.<ref>Minnehaha Academy Arrow, Spring 2013, p. 26</ref>}}\n\nAt Parsons College, Carol McKinney met Mark Highsmith, an artist from Queens, N.Y., who soon graduated and enlisted in the Army. The couple married in Minneapolis, then moved to Columbus, Georgia, where Mark Highsmith was stationed at Fort Benning. Upon his deployment to [[Vietnam]] in 1966, Carol Highsmith moved to Queens after securing a position at Peters Griffin Woodward, a national radio \"rep\" firm in Manhattan. As an assistant traffic manager at its Park Avenue offices, she logged advertisements for radio stations across the country. It was Highsmith's introduction to her first career in the broadcasting business.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===Early marriage and career===\nWhen Mark Highsmith returned from Vietnam in 1967, he was assigned to [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], and the couple briefly moved to [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. Shortly thereafter, Mark Highsmith was discharged from the Army, and the Highsmiths relocated to [[Philadelphia]], where he enrolled in the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]. Carol Highsmith worked at [[WPHL-TV]], the home of the \"Summertime at the Pier,\" a teenage dance show hosted by Philadelphia disc jockey Ed Hurst on Atlantic City's Steel Pier in nearby New Jersey.\n\nHighsmith wrote promotional copy and produced shows. One of her jobs was to assist [[Willie Webber|Bill \"Wee Willie\" Webber]] on his children's show, the [[Wee Willie Webber Colorful Cartoon Club]], Highsmith was pictured in a [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|''Philadelphia Inquirer'']] advertisement for the station, strumming a guitar. \"Take Over a TV Station (for 50 seconds),\" the ad copy read. \"TV 17 doesn't care who you are. How old you are. Or how you think. As long as you or your group can write and sing music.... So if you really care, stop griping. And start writing.\"\n\nIn 1969, Highsmith heard on the radio, at a time when stations were reporting such events, that her husband had committed suicide in his art studio.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> Mark had returned from Vietnam with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].\nDetermined to get her college degree, she moved to [[KYW-TV]] in broadcast sales. KYW paid for more college coursework at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], on nights and weekends.\n\n==Early career==\n===Broadcasting===\nIn 1976, Highsmith moved to Washington, D.C., and spent six years as a senior account executive for radio station [[WSBN|WMAL]] while taking classes at American University. She served on boards of directors including that of the [[Greater Washington Board of Trade]]<ref>http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms2029.xml</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Highsmith won a national contest initiated by the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York for the nation's most unusual sales effort.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} This stemmed from broadcasts from London and the [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany that she had devised and organized. She traveled with the broadcast team on both trips. ABC ran a full-page ad in ''The New York Times'' promoting one of the broadcasts from London.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nOne year at Oktoberfest in Munich, she recalled in a portfolio of her life's \"experiential learning\" that she would submit for college credits at American University, \"we broadcast from a different beer tent each night from a table with 6,000 drunk Germans singing around us. Since we had a language barrier, we could not easily interview people as we had [on another trip] in London. However, we did arrange some interesting interviews with Germans who spoke English. We interspersed the live cut-ins with German tunes, and our loyal listeners joined in back home.\"<ref>Meyer, Ed, and Frank Harden, Jackson Weaver, \"On the Radio With Harden and Weaver,\" self-published, 1983, p. 82.</ref>\n\nSoon photography would rise to the forefront of her life. The career change began in 1980, when she was named WMAL's Employee of the Year. Highsmith decided to apply the $1,000 prize award toward a trip to the [[Soviet Union]]. A longtime client gave her an inexpensive [[Pentax K1000]], a small, manual-focus [[single-lens reflex camera]] that shoots 35-millimeter film. Highsmith snapped photographs from [[Kiev]] to eastern [[Siberia]].\n\n===Beginning of photography===\nBack in the States working as a senior account executive in broadcasting, Highsmith was determined to further explore photography while completing an undergraduate degree. She studied photography at [[American University]] under Professor Anne Zelle and took night-school photography classes, taught by photographer Frank DiPerna, at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]].<ref>http://www.banguart.com/en/artistas_ficha.php?id=40{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDiPerna assigned each class member to photograph a model in an unusual location in metropolitan Washington. Highsmith chose the crumbling [[Willard Hotel]], which had been closed since 1968.<ref>https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/highsm/item/2011635197/</ref><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=willard%20hotel%201980s&co=highsm (77 other Highsmith photos from this period at loc.gov]</ref> Her mostly black-and-white photos taken there reaffirmed her eye for detail and solidified her interest in photographic art.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0712/highsmith.html|title=A Conversation with Carol Highsmith|work=loc.gov|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:willard hotel model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Carol M.

Highsmith and Frances Benjamin Johnston===\nIt was at the Willard that Highsmith first learned of [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]], and where she began her photography career. The once-opulent hotel was deserted, stripped of its furnishings and fixtures, and slated for demolition. \"[The Willard's] main tenant was a bum who was setting fires on the sixth floor,\" Highsmith told the ''New York Times'' when the newspaper recounted the hotel's long history in 2006. \"There were rats the sizes of cats. If I didn't take pictures, what would it look like in a few more years?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/arts/design/a-hotel-preens-as-the-center-of-political-attentions.html|title=A Hotel Preens as the Center of Political Attentions|first=Lynette|last=Clemetson|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In its Winter 1995 issue, ''Old House Interiors'' magazine also quoted her: \"I started to think, if this can happen to America's Main Street, what other buildings are decaying that we don't even know about, and who's documenting them?\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Old House Interiors, Vol. 1, No. 4; Home Buyer Publications; ISSN No. 1079-3941</ref>\n\nFrances Benjamin Johnston became Highsmith's professional inspiration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Johnston, too, had done a full study of the Beaux-Arts hotel in 1901, when it expanded from 100 to 389 rooms. When the decrepit Willard was finally saved through the efforts of a spirited \"Don't Tear it Down\" campaign, and then restored for its reopening in 1986, the only record available to those who re-created many of the hotel's lavish features were Johnston's faded, black-and-white images. Not a single blueprint or artist's drawing had survived the gutting of the historic hotel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n\"I was sucked into a moment of history,\" the Washington media quoted Highsmith in a 1988 profile. \"I didn't care if I got paid. I didn't care if I ate. I had to take those photographs. When the Willard opened, people called me from all over the world. I was the only one who had any images of the famous hotel.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFor a year after the grand hotel re-opened, it displayed an extensive exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work in an alcove off the \"Peacock Alley\" corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/1010/highsmith.html|title=21st-Century America (October 2010) \u2013 Library of Congress Information Bulletin|work=loc.gov|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> That exhibit remains as a permanent collection in smaller form.\n\nIn 2006, the American Institute of Architects would mount a four-month comparative exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work called \"Two Windows on the Willard.\" Like another AIA one-person exhibit of Highsmith's work, titled \"Structures of our Times: 31 Buildings That Changed Modern Life\" in 2002, the \"Two Windows\" study traveled to several locations across the country.<ref>{{cite web |title= Two Windows on the Willard: The Photographs of Carol M.

She had pieced together a small, primarily architectural, photography practice.\n\nIn a 1987 ''Washington Post'' story headlined, \"Doing What Comes Naturally,\" Don Oldenburg wrote of Highsmith's mid-career change:\n\n\"'You just sit and stare into space and think about what you'd really like to be doing,' the 41-year-old District resident recalls of her final months at WMAL radio five years ago. That was before she quit to make her dream career come true. She wanted to be a photographer....\n\n\"Ironically, those dreams of the ideal occupation that now and then distract most people from the workday grind, have traditionally been derided as detours from the American Dream. Those few individuals who actually act on their career fantasies have long been considered ne'er-do-wells, malingerers and daydreamers. Until they succeed. . . . 'It carved out a niche for me,' says Highsmith from her studio at 13th and G streets NW, where she employs seven assistants and charges up to $1,500 a day. The Willard photographs already are destined to become part of the photographic archives of architecture at the Library of Congress. Highsmith says she still gets goose bumps to think she's a professional photographer.\n\n\"Bob Swain believes that people like Highsmith, who make their fantasies their business, are 'the wave of the very near future.' The chairman of Swain & Swain Inc., a New York outplacement firm, bases that prediction partly on a recent survey he conducted of his clients\u2014predominantly midlevel managers and professionals who have been 'displaced' by their corporations and sent to Swain for career counseling.\n\n\"'Eighty-two percent of them admitted wanting to do something like that ... there is clearly a tendency to fantasize,' says Swain. 'Eighteen percent actually do it.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/08/25/doing-what-comes-naturally/71900997-2dbf-4fe2-8f2b-c0f48751b0ab/|title=DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY|first=Don|last=Oldenburg|date=August 25, 1987|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nAsked her personal motto by the ''Washington Times'' in 1989 in one of the newspaper's periodic profile of \"doers,\" Highsmith replied, \"A little hard work never hurt anyone.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chacha.com/question/who-said,-'a-little-hard-work-never-hurt-anyone'|title=Who said, 'a little hard work never hurt anyone'|work=chacha.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}} {{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Various projects===\n[[File:Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City]]\n\nHighsmith landed a contract to photograph another building on Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a turreted building called Sears House, where [[Mathew Brady]] had operated the studios in which he and his assistants photographed Washington luminaries during and after the Civil War. Her work at Sears House would lead to Highsmith's first photographic honor, a 1985 Award of Excellence from Communication Arts magazine.<ref name=\"Design Annual 1985, pp. 6-7\">Communications Arts Magazine \"Design Annual,\" Issue 180, November 1985, pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Highsmith's tie to \"The Avenue of Presidents\" solidified when she was hired by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Commission to document its wave of renovations on the avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscalifornia.us/index.php#mi=1&pt=0&pi=41&s=0&p=0&a=0&at=0|title=This Is California|work=thisiscalifornia.us|accessdate=September 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018200033/http://www.thisiscalifornia.us/index.php#mi=1&pt=0&pi=41&s=0&p=0&a=0&at=0|archive-date=October 18, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''Pennsylvania Avenue: America's Main Street'', published by the American Institute of Architects' AIA Press in 1988, became the first of her dozens of books. Detailing the transition of the avenue's south side into the \"Federal Triangle\" and the methodical redevelopment of its shoddy north side, the book was augmented by historic photographs and a text by Ted Landphair\u2014who had been WMAL's news director in the 1970s but barely knew Highsmith before leaving the station to work in other markets.\n\nWhen Landphair returned to Washington to join the [[Voice of America]] in 1986, he and Highsmith reconnected, and they married two years later as the Pennsylvania Avenue book was going to press. Carol M. Highsmith had added a collaborator husband and four stepchildren to her busy life.\n\n\"As you both know, it took forty years, eight presidents, and a great succession of Congressional enactments\" to \"revive the Avenue,\" U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had spearheaded Pennsylvania Avenue's renovation since his days as an aide to President John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, wrote Highsmith and Landphair in 2000. \"And you deserve a considerable share of the credit.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1992, the Library of Congress accepted 500 of Highsmith's photographs as the first installment of her continuing work to document architectural transitions in the nation's capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32205638/through-lens|title=THROUGH THE LENS|work=ebscohost.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> The collection would grow and become nationwide as Highsmith began to travel to other states to produce photographs for her books on American cities, states, and regions.\n\nThat same year, 1992, the D.C. Preservation League exhibited Highsmith's [[cibachrome]] photos of Washington historic landmarks. \"Her camera peers into dark, shaded porches in a shot of turn-of-the-century houses ... then glances down the clapboards of spare, wooden row houses build a decade before,\" the ''Washington Post'' reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1992/07/23/visual-arts/a62890df-e2c9-46ca-a36c-a53356a0ff42/|title=VISUAL ARTS|first=Mary|last=McCoy|date=July 23, 1992|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> \"With the exception of a canal boat gliding along the C&O [Canal], there's nothing touristy here. It's Washington as the locals know it.\"\n\nAnd in 1992 as well, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] presented Highsmith with its largest individual grant, a $20,000 Design Arts fellowship and individual project award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/carol-highsmith.html|title=Carol M Highsmith|work=Fine Art America|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> The award funded her and Landphair's travels to the western United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, to photograph examples of historic restoration for the ''America Restored'' book.\n\n[[File:Lollipop Motel Highsmith.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Neon sign of the Lollipop Motel in [[North Wildwood, New Jersey]]]]\n\nHighsmith deepened her affinity for architecture by documenting various stages of buildings' renewal for contractors, architects, and developers. \"Shooting enormous spaces in uncertain lighting conditions, her large format images reveal high quality and fine detail, capturing the splendor of the subject matter, be it a building in the midst of destruction or the elegance of a formal room,\" ''American Photographers'' magazine commented in 1989.<ref>{{cite book |title= American photographers: an illustrated who's who among leading contemporary Americans |author= Les Krantz |publisher= Facts on File |year= 1989 |isbn= 978-0-8160-1419-4 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 2000 to 2002, a three-year grant from the [[Annie E.

She and her sister Sara would spend the first half on her maternal grandmother's North Carolina tobacco farm and the second half in a starkly different world of chauffeurs and house servants among the elite of Atlanta, Georgia. Her paternal grandmother, also named Sara McKinney, was a friend of [[Margaret Mitchell]] and other society women, she told Lamb. \"We'd spend every day at someone's pool or country club,\" Highsmith said. \"Opera played on the radio.

In a 2013 profile of Highsmith, the Minnehaha Academy alumni magazine, the \"Arrow,\" quoted Highsmith:\n\n{{quote|The 1960s were a magical time. They remind me of what I've read about the liberating, transitional 1920s. We were at the right age to be profoundly affected by the churning changes in our times. Little did we know how profound and lasting would be the effects of the civil rights movement, landing a man on the moon, the rock'n'roll revolution, the Vietnam War and the protests against it, the social and counterculture movement, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Kennedy Brothers. I am the driven, creative, and somewhat unpredictable person I am partly because of those rebellious times, framed against the backdrop of solid, values-oriented Midwest surroundings.\n\nWhen I attended Minnehaha Academy, I was voted Most Mischievous!

The couple married in Minneapolis, then moved to Columbus, Georgia, where Mark Highsmith was stationed at Fort Benning. Upon his deployment to [[Vietnam]] in 1966, Carol Highsmith moved to Queens after securing a position at Peters Griffin Woodward, a national radio \"rep\" firm in Manhattan. As an assistant traffic manager at its Park Avenue offices, she logged advertisements for radio stations across the country. It was Highsmith's introduction to her first career in the broadcasting business.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===Early marriage and career===\nWhen Mark Highsmith returned from Vietnam in 1967, he was assigned to [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], and the couple briefly moved to [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. Shortly thereafter, Mark Highsmith was discharged from the Army, and the Highsmiths relocated to [[Philadelphia]], where he enrolled in the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]]. Carol Highsmith worked at [[WPHL-TV]], the home of the \"Summertime at the Pier,\" a teenage dance show hosted by Philadelphia disc jockey Ed Hurst on Atlantic City's Steel Pier in nearby New Jersey.\n\nHighsmith wrote promotional copy and produced shows. One of her jobs was to assist [[Willie Webber|Bill \"Wee Willie\" Webber]] on his children's show, the [[Wee Willie Webber Colorful Cartoon Club]], Highsmith was pictured in a [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|''Philadelphia Inquirer'']] advertisement for the station, strumming a guitar. \"Take Over a TV Station (for 50 seconds),\" the ad copy read. \"TV 17 doesn't care who you are. How old you are. Or how you think. As long as you or your group can write and sing music.... So if you really care, stop griping. And start writing.\"\n\nIn 1969, Highsmith heard on the radio, at a time when stations were reporting such events, that her husband had committed suicide in his art studio.<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/> Mark had returned from Vietnam with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].\nDetermined to get her college degree, she moved to [[KYW-TV]] in broadcast sales. KYW paid for more college coursework at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], on nights and weekends.\n\n==Early career==\n===Broadcasting===\nIn 1976, Highsmith moved to Washington, D.C., and spent six years as a senior account executive for radio station [[WSBN|WMAL]] while taking classes at American University. She served on boards of directors including that of the [[Greater Washington Board of Trade]]<ref>http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms2029.xml</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Highsmith won a national contest initiated by the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York for the nation's most unusual sales effort.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} This stemmed from broadcasts from London and the [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany that she had devised and organized. She traveled with the broadcast team on both trips. ABC ran a full-page ad in ''The New York Times'' promoting one of the broadcasts from London.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nOne year at Oktoberfest in Munich, she recalled in a portfolio of her life's \"experiential learning\" that she would submit for college credits at American University, \"we broadcast from a different beer tent each night from a table with 6,000 drunk Germans singing around us. Since we had a language barrier, we could not easily interview people as we had [on another trip] in London. However, we did arrange some interesting interviews with Germans who spoke English. We interspersed the live cut-ins with German tunes, and our loyal listeners joined in back home.\"<ref>Meyer, Ed, and Frank Harden, Jackson Weaver, \"On the Radio With Harden and Weaver,\" self-published, 1983, p. 82.</ref>\n\nSoon photography would rise to the forefront of her life. The career change began in 1980, when she was named WMAL's Employee of the Year. Highsmith decided to apply the $1,000 prize award toward a trip to the [[Soviet Union]]. A longtime client gave her an inexpensive [[Pentax K1000]], a small, manual-focus [[single-lens reflex camera]] that shoots 35-millimeter film. Highsmith snapped photographs from [[Kiev]] to eastern [[Siberia]].\n\n===Beginning of photography===\nBack in the States working as a senior account executive in broadcasting, Highsmith was determined to further explore photography while completing an undergraduate degree. She studied photography at [[American University]] under Professor Anne Zelle and took night-school photography classes, taught by photographer Frank DiPerna, at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design]].<ref>http://www.banguart.com/en/artistas_ficha.php?id=40{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDiPerna assigned each class member to photograph a model in an unusual location in metropolitan Washington.

If I didn't take pictures, what would it look like in a few more years?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/arts/design/a-hotel-preens-as-the-center-of-political-attentions.html|title=A Hotel Preens as the Center of Political Attentions|first=Lynette|last=Clemetson|date=February 3, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In its Winter 1995 issue, ''Old House Interiors'' magazine also quoted her: \"I started to think, if this can happen to America's Main Street, what other buildings are decaying that we don't even know about, and who's documenting them?\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Old House Interiors, Vol. 1, No. 4; Home Buyer Publications; ISSN No. 1079-3941</ref>\n\nFrances Benjamin Johnston became Highsmith's professional inspiration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Johnston, too, had done a full study of the Beaux-Arts hotel in 1901, when it expanded from 100 to 389 rooms. When the decrepit Willard was finally saved through the efforts of a spirited \"Don't Tear it Down\" campaign, and then restored for its reopening in 1986, the only record available to those who re-created many of the hotel's lavish features were Johnston's faded, black-and-white images. Not a single blueprint or artist's drawing had survived the gutting of the historic hotel.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n\"I was sucked into a moment of history,\" the Washington media quoted Highsmith in a 1988 profile. \"I didn't care if I got paid. I didn't care if I ate. I had to take those photographs. When the Willard opened, people called me from all over the world. I was the only one who had any images of the famous hotel.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFor a year after the grand hotel re-opened, it displayed an extensive exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work in an alcove off the \"Peacock Alley\" corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/1010/highsmith.html|title=21st-Century America (October 2010) \u2013 Library of Congress Information Bulletin|work=loc.gov|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> That exhibit remains as a permanent collection in smaller form.\n\nIn 2006, the American Institute of Architects would mount a four-month comparative exhibit of Highsmith and Johnston's work called \"Two Windows on the Willard.\" Like another AIA one-person exhibit of Highsmith's work, titled \"Structures of our Times: 31 Buildings That Changed Modern Life\" in 2002, the \"Two Windows\" study traveled to several locations across the country.<ref>{{cite web |title= Two Windows on the Willard: The Photographs of Carol M.

She had pieced together a small, primarily architectural, photography practice.\n\nIn a 1987 ''Washington Post'' story headlined, \"Doing What Comes Naturally,\" Don Oldenburg wrote of Highsmith's mid-career change:\n\n\"'You just sit and stare into space and think about what you'd really like to be doing,' the 41-year-old District resident recalls of her final months at WMAL radio five years ago. That was before she quit to make her dream career come true. She wanted to be a photographer....\n\n\"Ironically, those dreams of the ideal occupation that now and then distract most people from the workday grind, have traditionally been derided as detours from the American Dream. Those few individuals who actually act on their career fantasies have long been considered ne'er-do-wells, malingerers and daydreamers. Until they succeed. . . . 'It carved out a niche for me,' says Highsmith from her studio at 13th and G streets NW, where she employs seven assistants and charges up to $1,500 a day. The Willard photographs already are destined to become part of the photographic archives of architecture at the Library of Congress. Highsmith says she still gets goose bumps to think she's a professional photographer.\n\n\"Bob Swain believes that people like Highsmith, who make their fantasies their business, are 'the wave of the very near future.' The chairman of Swain & Swain Inc., a New York outplacement firm, bases that prediction partly on a recent survey he conducted of his clients\u2014predominantly midlevel managers and professionals who have been 'displaced' by their corporations and sent to Swain for career counseling.\n\n\"'Eighty-two percent of them admitted wanting to do something like that ... there is clearly a tendency to fantasize,' says Swain. 'Eighteen percent actually do it.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/08/25/doing-what-comes-naturally/71900997-2dbf-4fe2-8f2b-c0f48751b0ab/|title=DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY|first=Don|last=Oldenburg|date=August 25, 1987|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\nAsked her personal motto by the ''Washington Times'' in 1989 in one of the newspaper's periodic profile of \"doers,\" Highsmith replied, \"A little hard work never hurt anyone.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chacha.com/question/who-said,-'a-little-hard-work-never-hurt-anyone'|title=Who said, 'a little hard work never hurt anyone'|work=chacha.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}} {{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Various projects===\n[[File:Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City]]\n\nHighsmith landed a contract to photograph another building on Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a turreted building called Sears House, where [[Mathew Brady]] had operated the studios in which he and his assistants photographed Washington luminaries during and after the Civil War.

Detailing the transition of the avenue's south side into the \"Federal Triangle\" and the methodical redevelopment of its shoddy north side, the book was augmented by historic photographs and a text by Ted Landphair\u2014who had been WMAL's news director in the 1970s but barely knew Highsmith before leaving the station to work in other markets.\n\nWhen Landphair returned to Washington to join the [[Voice of America]] in 1986, he and Highsmith reconnected, and they married two years later as the Pennsylvania Avenue book was going to press. Carol M. Highsmith had added a collaborator husband and four stepchildren to her busy life.\n\n\"As you both know, it took forty years, eight presidents, and a great succession of Congressional enactments\" to \"revive the Avenue,\" U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had spearheaded Pennsylvania Avenue's renovation since his days as an aide to President John F.

[[Saint Peter's tomb]] is supposedly directly below the [[high altar]] of the basilica. For this reason, many [[pope]]s have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period. A church has stood on this site since the time of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]]. [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] dates from the 4th century AD.

Its central [[dome]] dominates the skyline of Rome. The basilica is approached via [[St. Peter's Square]], a forecourt in two sections, both surrounded by tall [[colonnade]]s. The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a [[giant order]] of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two {{convert|5.55|m}} statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]].<ref name=Pinto/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/StPaulStatue/StPaulStatue.htm|title=St. Peter's Square \u2013 Statue of St. Paul |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is [[cruciform]] in shape, with an elongated [[nave]] in the [[Latin cross]] form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a [[narthex]], or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the [[Holy Door]], only opened during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilees]].<ref name=Pinto/>\n\nThe interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches.<ref name=\"cathency\"/> One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building.

The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome. Moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are: The [[Baptistery]], the Chapel of the [[Presentation of the Virgin]], the larger Choir Chapel, the altar of the Transfiguration, the [[Pope Clement I|Clementine]] Chapel with the altar of [[Gregory the Great|Saint Gregory]], the [[Sacristy]] Entrance, the Altar of the Lie, the left [[transept]] with altars to the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, [[Saint Joseph]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], the altar of the [[Sacred Heart]], the Chapel of the Madonna of Column, the altar of Saint Peter and the Paralytic, the apse with the [[Chair of Saint Peter]], the altar of Saint Peter raising [[Dorcas|Tabitha]], the altar of St. Petronilla, the altar of the [[Archangel Michael]], the altar of the [[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]], the right transept with altars of [[Saint Erasmus]], Saints Processo and Martiniano, and [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]], the altar of St. Jerome, the altar of [[Saint Basil]], the Gregorian Chapel with the altar of the Madonna of Succour, the larger Chapel of the [[Holy Sacrament]], the Chapel of [[Saint Sebastian]] and the Chapel of the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]].<ref name=Pinto>Pio V.

Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\n\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''. The central feature is a [[baldachin]], or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic ''Chair of Saint Peter''.\n\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world. For religious, historical, and architectural reasons it by itself justifies a journey to Rome, and its interior offers a [[palimpsest]] of artistic styles at their best&nbsp;...\"<ref>Helen F.

The rank of major basilica confers on St. Peter's Basilica precedence before all [[minor basilica]]s worldwide. However, unlike all the other Papal Major Basilicas, it is wholly within the territory, and thus the sovereign jurisdiction, of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]], and not that of Italy.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benedict|last=Williamson|url=http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/treaty.htm|title=The Treaty of the Lateran|publisher=Burns, Oates, and Washbourne Limited|location=London, England|date=1929|pages=42\u201366}}</ref> This is in contrast to the other three Papal Major Basilicas, which are within Italian territory and not the territory of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].

One of the holiest sites of Christianity and Catholic Tradition, it is traditionally the burial site of its titular, [[St. Peter]], who was the head of the twelve [[twelve apostles|Apostles]] of [[Jesus]] and, according to tradition, the first [[Bishop of Antioch]] and later the first [[Bishop of Rome]], rendering him the first [[Pope]]. Although the New Testament does not mention St. Peter's martyrdom in Rome, tradition, based on the writings of the [[Fathers of the Church]],{{clarify|Clement of Rome was the only one close enough. This sounds rather deliberately vague. We have Clement's writing and can identify him. If unknown, let's omit|date=November 2010}} holds that his tomb is below the [[baldachin]] and altar of the Basilica in the \"Confession\". For this reason, many Popes have, from the early years of the Church, been buried near Pope St. Peter in the necropolis beneath the Basilica. Construction of the current basilica, over the old Constantinian basilica, began on 18 April 1506 and finished in 1615. At length, on 18 November 1626 [[Pope Urban VIII]] solemnly dedicated the Basilica.<ref name=\"cathency\"/>\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica is neither the [[Pope]]'s official seat nor first in rank among the [[Major basilica|Major Basilicas]] of Rome.

However, St. Peter's is certainly the Pope's principal church in terms of use because most Papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size, proximity to the Papal residence, and location within the Vatican City proper. The \"[[Chair of Saint Peter]]\", or [[cathedra]], an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by St. Peter himself, but which was a gift from [[Charles the Bald]] and used by many popes, symbolizes the continuing line of [[apostolic succession]] from St. Peter to the reigning Pope.

The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"''petra''\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. ([[s:Bible (King James)/John#1:42|John 1:42]], and see [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]])\n\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his [[martyrdom]] there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to [[Origen]], Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles |website=New Advent |date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=JL-M/>  The obelisk now stands in [[St. Peter's Square]] and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death.

The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square. A shrine was built on this site some years later. Almost three hundred years later, [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed over this site.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe area now covered by the [[Vatican City]] had been a cemetery for some years before the Circus of Nero was built. It was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the Circus and contained many Christian burials, because for many years after the burial of [[Saint Peter]] many Christians chose to be buried near Peter.\n\nIn 1939, in the reign of Pope Pius XII, 10 years of archeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the 9th century. The excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels, from [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1594)  to [[Callixtus II]] (1123) and [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (590\u2013604), built over an [[aedicula]] containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations, tinted with the precious [[murex]] purple. Although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of Peter, the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance. On 23 December 1950, in his pre-Christmas radio broadcast to the world, [[Pope Pius XII]] announced the discovery of [[Saint Peter's tomb]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Steven |last=Hijmans |title=University of Alberta Express News | work=In search of St. Peter's Tomb | url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=794 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060125031014/http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=794|archivedate=25 January 2006 | accessdate=25 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Old St. Peter's Basilica===\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro 1450.jpg|thumb|right|A conjectural view of the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] by H.

It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding, or at least making radical changes was [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1447\u201355). He commissioned work on the old building from [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/>  He had, however, ordered the demolition of the [[Colosseum]] and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/><ref>Quarrying of stone for the Colosseum had, in turn, been paid for with treasure looted at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] and destruction of the temple by the emperor [[Vespasian]]'s general (and the future emperor) [[Titus]] in 70 AD., Claridge, Amanda (1998).

Some walls for the choir had also been built.<ref>{{Harvnb|Betts|1993|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Julius II]] planned far more for St Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair or modification. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] and placed within St Peter's.<ref>Julius II's tomb was left incomplete and was eventually erected in the Church of St Peter ad Vincola.</ref>  In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and \"aggrandize himself in the popular imagination\".<ref name=BF/>  A competition was held, and a number of the designs have survived at the [[Uffizi Gallery]]. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521), [[Pope Hadrian VI|Hadrian VI]] (1522\u20131523). [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534), [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), [[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), [[Pope Marcellus II|Marcellus II]] (1555), [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555\u20131559), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565), [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] (saint) (1565\u20131572), [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] (1572\u20131585), [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] (1585\u20131590), [[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]] (1590), [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]] (1590\u20131591), [[Pope Innocent IX|Innocent IX]] (1591), [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), [[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]] (1605), [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621), [[Pope Gregory XV|Gregory XV]] (1621\u20131623), [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623\u20131644) and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]] (1644\u20131655).\n\n===Financing with indulgences===\nOne method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of [[indulgences]] in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was [[Albrecht of Mainz|Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg]], who had to clear debts owed to the [[Roman Curia]] by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preacher [[Johann Tetzel]], whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.<ref>\"[[Johann Tetzel]]\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007: \"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\"</ref>\n\nA German [[Augustinian]] priest, [[Martin Luther]], wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as ''[[The 95 Theses]]''.<ref>Hillerbrand, Hans J. \"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007.</ref> This became a factor in starting the [[protestant reformation|Reformation]], the birth of [[Protestantism]].\n\n==Architecture==\n===Successive plans===\n[[File:SaintPierre.svg|thumb|upright|Bramante's plan|alt=This is plan 1 of 3.

This plan shows a return to the form of plan 1. but with all the various parts made bolder.]]\nPope Julius' scheme for the grandest building in Christendom<ref name=BF>{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1975}}</ref> was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence. It was the design of [[Donato Bramante]] that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous [[Greek Cross]] with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].<ref name=BF/> The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a [[Roof lantern|lantern]] with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of [[Florence Cathedral]] designed for Brunelleschi's dome by [[Michelozzo]].<ref name=Hartt/>\n\nBramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal [[chancel]], nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.<ref>Bramante's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] and [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo]], who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). [[Raphael]] was confirmed as architect of St. Peter's on 1 August, 1514.<ref>{{cite book |last=Golzio |first=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |date=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |pp=593\u201394}}</ref>The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.<ref>Raphael's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante.<ref>Peruzzi's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by [[Emperor Charles V]]. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.<ref name=BF/>\n\nAt this point [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa\u00e7ade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\">Sangallo's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nOn 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldscheider|1996}}</ref> He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, [[Giulio Romano]] and the refusal of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] to leave [[Venice]]. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.<ref name=JL-M>{{Harvnb|Lees-Milne|1967}}</ref>\n\n===Michelangelo's contribution===\n[[Michelangelo]] took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] form, like the iconic [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, or of a [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].\n\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"<ref name=Gardner>{{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005}}</ref>\n\nAs it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by [[Carlo Maderno]]. It is the [[chancel]] end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the [[Vatican State]] and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections.<ref>Michelangelo's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref> Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small [[vestry]] or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a [[giant order]] of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface. Above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band, giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression.<ref name=Mignacca>Eneide Mignacca, ''Michelangelo and the architecture of St. Peter's Basilica'', lecture, Sydney University, (1982)</ref>\n\n===Dome: successive and final designs===\n[[File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzf).jpg|thumb|upright|Bramante's dome|alt= Engraved image in two parts.

It has a greater diameter by approximately {{convert|30|ft|m}} than Constantinople's [[Hagia Sophia]] church, completed in 537. It was to the domes of the Pantheon and Florence [[duomo]] that the architects of St. Peter's looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived, from the outset, as the greatest dome of [[Christendom]].\n\n====Bramante and Sangallo, 1506 and 1513====\n[[File:Roma S.Pietro in Vaticano (zzg).jpg|thumb|left|alt= An engraved picture showing an immensely complex design for the fa\u00e7ade, with two ornate towers and a multitude of windows, pilasters and pediments, above which the dome rises looking like a three-tiered wedding cake.|Sangallo's design]]\n\nThe dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door. The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply [[coffering|coffered]] which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening {{convert|8|m|ft}} across which provides light to the interior.<ref name=BF/>\n\nBramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in [[Tufa]] [[Concrete]] for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a [[drum (architecture)|drum]] raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a [[peristyle]].\n\nIn the case of [[Florence Cathedral]], the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] made its construction feasible.<ref>The dome of Florence Cathedral is depicted in a fresco at [[Santa Maria Novella]] that pre-dates its building by about 100 years.</ref> Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.<ref name=Hartt>{{Harvnb|Hartt|2006}}</ref>\n\nSangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a [[peristyle]] and surmounted by a spire of conic form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\"/> According to [[James Lees-Milne]] the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}<!---Leave this.

Its drum is framed by two very much smaller domes.]]\n[[Michelangelo]] redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of [[Florence]], is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of {{convert|15|m|ft}} high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a [[Sphere|hemispherical]] [[dome]], such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each {{convert|18|m|ft}} across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] with [[Giorgio Vasari]] appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed [[Giacomo della Porta]] who was to be assisted by [[Domenico Fontana]]. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Caradosso Foppa, View of Saint Peter's (reverse), 1506, NGA 44669.jpg|thumb|upright|1506 medal by [[Cristoforo Foppa]] depicting Bramante's design, including the four flanking smaller domes<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 641] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 }}</ref>]]\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details.

The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Elevation Showing the Exterior of Saint Peter's Basilica from the South as Conceived by Michelagelo (Published in 1569) MET DT203424.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The engraving by Stefan du P\u00e9rac was published in 1569, five years after the death of Michelangelo |alt=This engraving shows the chancel end of the building much as it was built, except that the dome in this picture is completely semi-circular, not ovoid]]\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo]&nbsp;... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nIt is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome ''must'' appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections.<ref name=Mignacca/> If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the [[Classicism]] of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the Baroque]].<ref name=Mignacca/>\n\n====Completion====\n[[File:Dome of Saint Peter's Basilica (Interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The dome was brought to completion by Giacomo della Porta and Fontana.|alt= Photo looking up at the dome's interior from below.

His successor, [[Gregory XIV]], saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, [[Clement VIII]], had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the [[True Cross]] and a relic of [[St. Andrew]] and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting.

The timbers were salvaged for the roof of the [[Borghese Palace]] and two rare black [[marble]] columns, the largest of their kind, were carefully stored and later used in the [[narthex]]. The tombs of various popes were opened, treasures removed and plans made for re-interment in the new basilica.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:StPetersplan OttoLeuger1904.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Michelangelo's plan extended with Maderno's nave and narthex]]\nThe Pope had appointed [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1602. He was a nephew of [[Domenico Fontana]] and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The ''Fabbrica'' or building [[committee]], a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the [[Curia]] who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the [[Counter-Reformation]] which increasingly associated a [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] plan with paganism and saw the [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] as truly symbolic of Christianity.<ref name=JL-M/> The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"<ref name=\"Pile\">{{Harvnb|Pile|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, [[Vestry|vestries]] and [[Sacristy|sacristies]] had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a [[nave]] that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the [[facade]] were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the [[stucco]] decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Maderno's facade====\n[[File:0 Basilique Saint-Pierre - Rome (2).JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Maderno's fa\u00e7ade, with the statues of Saint Peter (left) and Saint Paul (right) flanking the entrance stairs|alt=Ornate building in the early morning with a giant order of columns beneath a Latin inscription, fourteen statues on the roofline, and large dome on top.]]\nThe facade designed by Maderno, is {{convert|114.69|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|45.55|m|ft}} high and is built of [[travertine]] stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall [[Attic style|attic]] surmounted by thirteen statues: [[Christ]] flanked by eleven of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] (except [[Saint Peter]], whose statue is left of the stairs) and [[John the Baptist]].\n<ref>[[:File:San Pietro in Vaticano 001.JPG|Another view of the fa\u00e7ade statues]].

The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the [[attic]] story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:San Pietro in Vaticano 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The narthex|alt=Photo shows view of vestibule with three huge doorways leading to the church's interior. The doors are framed by columns and have pediments. The floor is of inlaid marble. The nearest doorway is closed by two huge ancient bronze doors. A group listens to a tour guide while one woman examines the doors.]]\n\n====Narthex and portals====\nBehind the fa\u00e7ade of St. Peter's stretches a long portico or \"[[narthex]]\" such as was occasionally found in Italian churches. This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of [[Charlemagne]] (18th century) by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] in the south end and ''[[The Vision of Constantine (Bernini)|The Vision of Constantine]]'' (1670) by [[Bernini]] in the north end.\n\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica. The central portal has a [[bronze]] door created by [[Filarete|Antonio Averulino]] c.&nbsp;1440 for the old basilica<ref>{{cite book |last=Decker |first=Heinrich |title=The Renaissance in Italy: Architecture \u2022 Sculpture \u2022 Frescoes |year=1969 |origyear=1967 |publisher=The Viking Press |location=New York |p=279}}</ref> and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space.\n\n====Maderno's nave====\n[[File:Vatican-StPierre-Int\u00e9rieur1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Maderno's nave, looking towards the chancel|alt= This photo of the interior reveals the near details of the arched ceiling which is divided into square coffers. The changes that Maderno made to the axis and width can be seen clearly in this picture.]]\nTo the single bay of [[Michelangelo]]'s Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient [[List of obelisks in Rome|Egyptian obelisk]] had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe nave has huge paired [[pilaster]]s, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building.<ref name=JL-M/><ref>The word \"stupendous\" is used by a number of writers trying to adequately describe the enormity of the interior. These include James Lees-Milne and Banister Fletcher.</ref> The four [[cherub]]s who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two [[holy water]] basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller [[chapel]]s and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, [[Gilding|gilt]], [[sculpture]] and [[mosaic]]. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces. \n\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its [[Baluster|balustrade]] are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n===Influence on church architecture===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced [[church architecture]] in [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]. Within Rome, the huge domed church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of [[San Carlo ai Catinari]], [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]], and many others. [[Christopher Wren]]'s dome at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] ([[London]], [[England]]), the domes of [[Karlskirche]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]]), [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church]] ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]), and the [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]) all pay [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago]], [[St. Josaphat's Basilica]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh]] and [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] in [[Montreal]], which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. [[Post-Modernism]] has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]].\n\n==Bernini's furnishings==\n[[File:The Chair of Saint Peter adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|The apse with St. Peter's Cathedra supported by four Doctors of the Church|alt=Pews before the ornate, gold-leafed throne of St. Peter]]\n\n===Pope Urban VIII and Bernini===\nAs a young boy [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter [[Annibale Carracci]] and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]] and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the [[Baroque]] period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the [[baldachin]] (baldaquin, from Italian: ''baldacchino''), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and [[loggia]]s in the piers of the dome and the [[Chair of Saint Peter|chair of St. Peter]].<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\n====Baldacchino and niches====\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Baldachin}}\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|baldacchino]], a pavilion-like structure {{convert|28.74|m|ft}} tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the [[Ciborium (architecture)|''ciborium'']], of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the [[Sacrament]]<!-- -Caps needed in this sense- --> is laid for the [[Eucharist]] and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ''ciboria'' are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the [[baldachin]] or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted [[Solomonic columns|barley-sugar shape]] had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Jerusalem]] and donated by the [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]]. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\n[[File:Interiorvaticano8baldaquino.jpg|High altar|thumb|left|The altar with Bernini's baldacchino|alt= Photo shows the baldachin standing in the centre of the church, viewed looking towards the nave. There is an altar beneath it which has a red and gold frontal cloth decorated with large crosses.]]\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'' in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\nAs part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four [[Balcony|balconies]]. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the [[Holy Lance|spear of Longinus]], said to have pierced the side of Christ, the [[veil of Veronica]], with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the [[True Cross]] discovered in [[Jerusalem]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], and a relic of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only ''Saint Longinus'' is the work of Bernini.<ref name=JL-M/> (See below)\n\n====Bernini's Towers====\n[[File:Cathedrapetri+gloria.jpg|thumb|Bernini's Cathedra Petri and ''Gloria''|alt=The chair-shaped bronze reliquary which holds the throne of St Peter is much larger than a normal chair, is ornate in shape and decorated with relief sculpture and gold leaf. The \"Gloria\" which surrounds a round window is a sculpture of clouds and sun-rays, surrounded by angels, the whole lot being covered in gleaming gold leaf.]]\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\n\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\n\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n====Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament====\n{{Main article|Chair of Saint Peter}}\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called ''[[Cathedra Petri]]'' or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, [[Pope Alexander VII]] determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four [[Doctors of the Church]], Saints [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine]] representing the Latin Church and [[Athanasius]] and [[John Chrysostom]], the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the Cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow [[alabaster]], illuminating, at its center, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, [[Andrea Sacchi]], had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.<ref name=\"JL-M\" /><ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nBernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament.<ref name=\"Basilica Info\">{{cite web|last=Kilby|first=Peter|title=St Peter's Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)|url=http://www.rome.info/vatican/st-peters-basilica/|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's [[Tempietto]], the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==St. Peter's Piazza==\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Square}}\n<!-- -NOTE:This section uses the well-known Italian word \"piazza\" because the English translation to \"square\" is a misnomer.- -->\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro (notte).jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's Basilica and the piazza at night|alt=Behind a large monolithic obelisk, the facade of St. Peter's Basilica, lit by floodlights, rising majestically against the night sky]]\nTo the east of the basilica is the ''Piazza di San Pietro'', ([[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]]). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the [[Baroque]] inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian [[obelisk]] which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade.<ref>The obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis by an unknown pharaoh of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (c. 2494 BC \u2013 2345 BC).</ref> The [[obelisk]], known as \"The Witness\", at {{convert|25.31|m|ft}} and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of {{convert|40|m|ft}}, is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the [[Circus of Nero]] in 37&nbsp;AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the [[crucifixion]] of Saint Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/Obelisk/Obelisk.htm|title=St. Peter's, the Obelisk |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> Its removal to its present location by order of [[Pope Sixtus V]] and engineered by [[Domenico Fontana]] on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of [[Sanremo]], and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Fountain of Carlo Maderno night.jpg|thumb|One of the two fountains which form the axis of the piazza.|alt=View of one fountain which rises in two tiers from a sculptured pool. The fountain is playing and the water is sparkling.]]\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large [[fountain]] designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] in [[Siena]]. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The [[trapezoid]] plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nBernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its center. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an [[entablature]] of the simple [[Tuscan order|Tuscan Order]].\n\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".<ref name=Gardner/>  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the [[Via della Conciliazione]], built by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaties]], leads from the [[Tiber|River Tiber]] to the [[Town square|piazza]] and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a [[terminating vista]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nBernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\".<ref name=Gardner/> Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility&nbsp;... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"<ref name=BF/>\n[[File:St Peter's Square, Vatican City - April 2007.jpg|upright=2.25|thumb|centre|View of Rome from the Dome of St. Peter's Basilica|alt=At the front of the view are the backs of thirteen large statues that stand in along the edge of the fa\u00e7ade. Beyond them can be seen the piazza which is in three parts. The nearest appears square, while the second widens into an oval surrounded on each side by the huge grey columns on the colonnade, and with the obelisk at its centre. Beyond that is a further square surrounded by pale pink buildings. A wide street leads from the square, at the end of which can be seen the river, a bridge and castle.]]\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows [[European mean time]]. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the roman clock is the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City]] since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"  \n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]] that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell '''Rota''' dates from 1288 and the bourdon called '''Campanone''' is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Bell#\n!Name\n!Mass \n!Casted\n|-\n|1\n|Campanella\n|260 kg\n|1825\n|-\n|2\n|Ave Maria \n|280 kg\n|1932\n|-\n|3\n|Predica\n|850 kg\n|1893\n|-\n|4\n|Rota\n|2 t\n|1288\n|-\n|5\n|Campanoncino (Mezzana, Benedittina)\n|4 t\n|1725\n|-\n|6\n|Campanone\n|9 t\n|1785\n|}\n\n==Treasures==\n[[File:Crypt air vent.jpg|thumb|[[Air vent]]s for the crypt in St. Peter's Basilica|alt=White and orange marble rings a circular, decorated bronze vent]]\n\n===Tombs and relics===\n{{Main article|List of papal tombs}}\nThere are over 100 [[tomb]]s within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica.

The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\n* One of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by [[Giotto]] (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church.<ref name=Pinto/> The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\n* At each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north [[Constantine the Great]] by Bernini (1670) and to the south [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] (18th century).<ref name=Pinto/>\n* Of the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by [[Antonio di Pietro Averlino|Antonio Averulino]] (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the ''[[Door of the Dead in St. Peter's Basilica|Door of the Dead]]'', was designed by 20th-century sculptor [[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]] and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\n* The northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee year]] by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by [[Vico Consorti]] in 1950 and cast in [[Florence]] by the [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]]. Above it are inscriptions commemorating the opening of the door: {{font|{{lang|la|PAVLVS V PONT MAX ANNO XIII}}|font=Roman}} and {{font|{{lang|la|GREGORIVS XIII PONT MAX}}|font=Roman}}.\n\nRecently installed commemorative plaques read above the door as follows:\n{{quote|{{font|{{lang|la|PAVLVS VI PONT MAX HVIVS PATRIARCALIS VATICANAE BASILICAE PORTAM SANCTAM APERVIT ET CLAVSIT ANNO IVBILAEI MCMLXXV}}||font=Roman}}<br />''Paul VI, Pontifex Maximus, opened and closed the holy door of this patriarchal Vatican basilica in the jubilee year of 1975.''}}\n{{quote|{{font|{{lang|la|IOANNES PAVLVS II P.M.

One foot of the statue is largely worn away by [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] kissing it for centuries.\n* The sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican [[Grotto]]es (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by [[Canova]] of [[Pope Pius VI]], who was captured and mistreated by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\n* In the Confessio is the ''Niche of the Pallium'' (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\n* The High [[Altar]] is surmounted by Bernini's [[baldachin]]. (See above)\n* Set in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] holding the [[True Cross]] and the [[Nail (relic)|Holy Nails]], by [[Andrea Bolgi]]; [[Saint Longinus]] holding the [[Holy Lance|spear that pierced the side of Jesus]], by Bernini (1639); [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] with the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], by [[Francois Duquesnoy]] and [[Saint Veronica]] holding her [[Veil of Veronica|veil with the image of Jesus' face]], by [[Francesco Mochi]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"150px\">\nFile:Saint Helena.jpg|alt= A marble statue showing a matronly woman in a sweeping cloak supporting a cross which stands beside her and presenting a set of nails to the viewer with her left hand|''Saint Helena''<br>by Andrea Bolgi\nFile:Saint Longinus.jpg|alt= This statue shows a Roman soldier, with a cloak furling around him, gazing upward while he supports a long spear with his right hand and throws out his other hand in amazement.|''Saint Longinus''<br>by Bernini\nFile:Saint Andreas.jpg|alt= This statue shows an elderly man, bare-chested, and draped, looking up despairingly as he supports a large cross, arranged diagonally.|''Saint Andrew''<br>by Francois Duquesnoy\nFile:Saint veronica.jpg|alt= This statue shows the saint as a young woman, who, with a sweeping dramatic gesture, displays a cloth on which there is an image of the face of Jesus.|''Saint Veronica''<br>by Francesco Mochi\n</gallery>\n\n====North aisle====\n* In the first chapel of the north aisle is [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''.<ref>The statue was damaged in 1972 by Lazlo Toft, a Hungarian-Australian, who considered that the veneration shown to the statue was idolatrous. The damage was repaired and the statue subsequently placed behind glass.</ref>\n* On the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\n* The second chapel, dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian]], contains the statues of popes [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of [[Pope Innocent XI]] but his remains were moved to the ''Altar of the Transfiguration'' on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of [[Pope John Paul II]]. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\n* The large chapel on the right aisle is the ''Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament'' which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' at [[San Pietro in Montorio]] supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the [[Holy Trinity]] by [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n* Near the altar of ''Our Lady of Succour'' are the monuments of popes [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] by [[Camillo Rusconi]] (1723) and [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]].\n* At the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of [[Saint Petronilla]] and with an altarpiece ''The Burial of St Petronilla'' by [[Guercino]] (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n====South aisle====\n* The first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and designed by [[Carlo Fontana]], (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font, which was previously located in the opposite chapel, is the red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] of Probus, the 4th-century [[Prefect]] of Rome. The lid came from a different [[sarcophagus]], which had once held the remains of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] and in removing it from the Vatican Grotto where it had been stored, the workmen broke it into ten pieces. Fontana restored it expertly and surmounted it with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\".\n* Against the first pier of the aisle is the [[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]], James and his sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]], known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" and [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry, Cardinal and Duke of York]]. The tomb is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] design by [[Canova]] unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]].\n* The second chapel is that of the ''Presentation of the Virgin'' and contains the memorials of [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].\n* Against the piers are the tombs of [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]].\n* The large chapel off the south aisle is the ''Choir Chapel'' which contains the altar of the ''[[Immaculate Conception]]''.\n* At the entrance to the [[Sacristy]] is the tomb of [[Pope Pius VIII]]\n* The south transept contains the altars of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint Joseph]] and the ''Crucifixion of [[Saint Peter]]''.\n* The tomb of Fabio Chigi, [[Pope Alexander VII]], towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the [[Baroque]] Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] and [[Truth]]. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant [[England]]. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of [[Death]],<!-- -NOTE: Death requires a capital letter in this sense.- --> its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an [[hourglass]] stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Rome basilica st peter 004 adjusted.JPG|alt= A pair of bronze doors divided into sixteen panels containing reliefs depicting scenes mainly from the life of Jesus and stories that he told.|The Holy Door is opened only for great celebrations.\nFile:0 Monument fun\u00e9raire du pape Alexandre VII - St-Pierre - Vatican (1).jpg|alt= A large memorial set in a niche.

It has been described as \"holding a unique position in the [[Christianity|Christian]] world\"<ref>James Lees-Milne describes St. Peter's Basilica as \"a church with a unique position in the Christian world\" in {{Harvnb|Lees-Milne|1967|p=12}}.</ref> and as \"the greatest of all churches of [[Christendom]]\".<ref name=BF1>[[Banister Fletcher]], the renowned architectural historian calls it \"the greatest creation of the Renaissance\" and \"...&nbsp;the greatest of all churches of Christendom\" in {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=719}}.{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reidsitaly.com/destinations/lazio/rome/sights/st_peters.html|title=St. Peter's Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro) in Rome, Italy|work=reidsitaly.com}}</ref>\n\nCatholic tradition holds that the [[basilica]] is the burial site of [[Saint Peter]], chief among [[Jesus]]'s [[apostles]] and also the first [[Bishop of Rome|Bishop of Rome (Pope)]]. [[Saint Peter's tomb]] is supposedly directly below the [[high altar]] of the basilica. For this reason, many [[pope]]s have been interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period. A church has stood on this site since the time of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]]. [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] dates from the 4th century AD. Construction of the present basilica began on 18 April 1506 and was completed on 18 November 1626.<ref name=\"cathency\">{{Harvnb|Baumgarten|1913}}</ref>\n\nSt. Peter's is famous as a place of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] and for its [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions. The pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining [[St. Peter's Square]]; these liturgies draw audiences numbering from 15,000 to over 80,000 people.<ref>''[http://www.papalaudience.org/papal-mass Papal Mass]'' (accessed 28 February 2012)</ref> St. Peter's has many historical associations, with the [[Early Christian Church]], the [[Pope|Papacy]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Catholic [[Counter-reformation]] and numerous artists, especially [[Michelangelo]]. As a work of architecture, it is regarded as the greatest building of its age.<ref name=BF/> St. Peter's is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of [[major basilica]], all four of which are in Rome. Contrary to popular misconception, it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop; the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the pope as Bishop of Rome is at Saint John Lateran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/11/st-peters-basilica-in-vatican-is-not-the-official-church-of-the-pope/|title=St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican Is Not The Official Church Of The Pope|last=Noreen|date=19 November 2012|website=Today I Found Out|language=en-US|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:PonteSantAngeloRom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|View from the [[Tiber]] on ''[[Ponte Sant'Angelo]]'' and the Basilica.

A bridge crosses the river and beyond it is a hill on which the grey dome of St. Peter's rises above ancient buildings and dark pine trees.]]\n\nSt. Peter's is a church built in the Renaissance style located in the Vatican City west of the River [[Tiber]] and near the [[Janiculum]] Hill and [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's Mausoleum]]. Its central [[dome]] dominates the skyline of Rome. The basilica is approached via [[St. Peter's Square]], a forecourt in two sections, both surrounded by tall [[colonnade]]s. The first space is oval and the second trapezoidal. The fa\u00e7ade of the basilica, with a [[giant order]] of columns, stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two {{convert|5.55|m}} statues of the 1st-century apostles to Rome, Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]].<ref name=Pinto/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/StPaulStatue/StPaulStatue.htm|title=St. Peter's Square \u2013 Statue of St. Paul |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe basilica is [[cruciform]] in shape, with an elongated [[nave]] in the [[Latin cross]] form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture. The central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world. The entrance is through a [[narthex]], or entrance hall, which stretches across the building. One of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the [[Holy Door]], only opened during [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilees]].<ref name=Pinto/>\n\nThe interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches.<ref name=\"cathency\"/> One author wrote: \"Only gradually does it dawn upon us \u2013 as we watch people draw near to this or that monument, strangely they appear to shrink; they are, of course, dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building. This in its turn overwhelms us.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Georgina|last=Masson|authorlink=Georgina Masson|title=The Companion Guide to Rome|publisher=Companion Guides|\ndate=2001|pages=615\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe nave which leads to the central dome is in three bays, with piers supporting a barrel-vault, the highest of any church. The nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them. There are also chapels surrounding the dome. Moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are: The [[Baptistery]], the Chapel of the [[Presentation of the Virgin]], the larger Choir Chapel, the altar of the Transfiguration, the [[Pope Clement I|Clementine]] Chapel with the altar of [[Gregory the Great|Saint Gregory]], the [[Sacristy]] Entrance, the Altar of the Lie, the left [[transept]] with altars to the Crucifixion of Saint Peter, [[Saint Joseph]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], the altar of the [[Sacred Heart]], the Chapel of the Madonna of Column, the altar of Saint Peter and the Paralytic, the apse with the [[Chair of Saint Peter]], the altar of Saint Peter raising [[Dorcas|Tabitha]], the altar of St. Petronilla, the altar of the [[Archangel Michael]], the altar of the [[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]], the right transept with altars of [[Saint Erasmus]], Saints Processo and Martiniano, and [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]], the altar of St. Jerome, the altar of [[Saint Basil]], the Gregorian Chapel with the altar of the Madonna of Succour, the larger Chapel of the [[Holy Sacrament]], the Chapel of [[Saint Sebastian]] and the Chapel of the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]].<ref name=Pinto>Pio V.

Two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the Constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of Saint Peter.\n\nThe entire interior of St. Peter's is lavishly decorated with marble, reliefs, architectural sculpture and gilding. The basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people, many of which are considered outstanding artworks. There are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels, including [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''. The central feature is a [[baldachin]], or canopy over the Papal Altar, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. The apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble, also by Bernini, and containing the symbolic ''Chair of Saint Peter''.\n\nOne observer wrote: \"St Peter's Basilica is the reason why Rome is still the center of the civilized world. For religious, historical, and architectural reasons it by itself justifies a journey to Rome, and its interior offers a [[palimpsest]] of artistic styles at their best&nbsp;...\"<ref>Helen F.

The name Peter is \"Petrus\" in Latin and \"Petros\" in Greek, deriving from \"''petra''\" which means \"stone\" or \"rock\" in [[Greek language|Greek]], and is the literal translation of the Aramaic \"Kepa\", the name given to Simon by Jesus. ([[s:Bible (King James)/John#1:42|John 1:42]], and see [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:18|Matthew 16:18]])\n\nCatholic tradition holds that Peter, after a ministry of thirty-four years, travelled to Rome and met his [[martyrdom]] there along with Paul on 13 October 64 AD during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]. His execution was one of the many martyrdoms of Christians following the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. According to [[Origen]], Peter was crucified head downwards, by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles |website=New Advent |date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> The crucifixion took place near an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the [[Circus of Nero]].<ref name=JL-M/>  The obelisk now stands in [[St. Peter's Square]] and is revered as a \"witness\" to Peter's death.

The Via Cornelia was a road which ran east-to-west along the north wall of the Circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the Basilica and St. Peter's Square.

It appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding, or at least making radical changes was [[Pope Nicholas V]] (1447\u201355). He commissioned work on the old building from [[Leone Battista Alberti]] and [[Bernardo Rossellino]] and also had Rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica, or an extreme modification of the old. His reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died, little had been achieved.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/>  He had, however, ordered the demolition of the [[Colosseum]] and by the time of his death, 2,522 cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building.<ref name=\"JL-M\"/><ref>Quarrying of stone for the Colosseum had, in turn, been paid for with treasure looted at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] and destruction of the temple by the emperor [[Vespasian]]'s general (and the future emperor) [[Titus]] in 70 AD., Claridge, Amanda (1998).

Some walls for the choir had also been built.<ref>{{Harvnb|Betts|1993|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Julius II]] planned far more for St Peter's than Nicholas V's program of repair or modification. Julius was at that time planning his own tomb, which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] and placed within St Peter's.<ref>Julius II's tomb was left incomplete and was eventually erected in the Church of St Peter ad Vincola.</ref>  In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and \"aggrandize himself in the popular imagination\".<ref name=BF/>  A competition was held, and a number of the designs have survived at the [[Uffizi Gallery]]. A succession of popes and architects followed in the next 120 years, their combined efforts resulting in the present building. The scheme begun by Julius II continued through the reigns of [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521), [[Pope Hadrian VI|Hadrian VI]] (1522\u20131523). [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534), [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), [[Pope Julius III|Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), [[Pope Marcellus II|Marcellus II]] (1555), [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555\u20131559), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565), [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] (saint) (1565\u20131572), [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] (1572\u20131585), [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] (1585\u20131590), [[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]] (1590), [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]] (1590\u20131591), [[Pope Innocent IX|Innocent IX]] (1591), [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), [[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]] (1605), [[Pope Paul V|Paul V]] (1605\u20131621), [[Pope Gregory XV|Gregory XV]] (1621\u20131623), [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623\u20131644) and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]] (1644\u20131655).\n\n===Financing with indulgences===\nOne method employed to finance the building of St. Peter's Basilica was the granting of [[indulgences]] in return for contributions. A major promoter of this method of fund-raising was [[Albrecht of Mainz|Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz and Magdeburg]], who had to clear debts owed to the [[Roman Curia]] by contributing to the rebuilding program. To facilitate this, he appointed the German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preacher [[Johann Tetzel]], whose salesmanship provoked a scandal.<ref>\"[[Johann Tetzel]]\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007: \"Tetzel's experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht, archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices. In effect, Tetzel became a salesman whose product was to cause a scandal in Germany that evolved into the greatest crisis (the Reformation) in the history of the Western church.\"</ref>\n\nA German [[Augustinian]] priest, [[Martin Luther]], wrote to Archbishop Albrecht arguing against this \"selling of indulgences\". He also included his \"Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences\", which came to be known as ''[[The 95 Theses]]''.<ref>Hillerbrand, Hans J. \"Martin Luther: Indulgences and salvation,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007.</ref> This became a factor in starting the [[protestant reformation|Reformation]], the birth of [[Protestantism]].\n\n==Architecture==\n===Successive plans===\n[[File:SaintPierre.svg|thumb|upright|Bramante's plan|alt=This is plan 1 of 3.

This plan shows a return to the form of plan 1. but with all the various parts made bolder.]]\nPope Julius' scheme for the grandest building in Christendom<ref name=BF>{{Harvnb|Fletcher|1975}}</ref> was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence. It was the design of [[Donato Bramante]] that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous [[Greek Cross]] with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].<ref name=BF/> The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a [[Roof lantern|lantern]] with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of [[Florence Cathedral]] designed for Brunelleschi's dome by [[Michelozzo]].<ref name=Hartt/>\n\nBramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes. The equal [[chancel]], nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse. At each corner of the building was to stand a tower, so that the overall plan was square, with the apses projecting at the cardinal points. Each apse had two large radial buttresses, which squared off its semi-circular shape.<ref>Bramante's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was replaced with [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] and [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo]], who both died in 1515 (Bramante himself having died the previous year). [[Raphael]] was confirmed as architect of St. Peter's on 1 August, 1514.<ref>{{cite book |last=Golzio |first=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |date=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |pp=593\u201394}}</ref>The main change in his plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.<ref>Raphael's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1520 Raphael also died, aged 37, and his successor [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] maintained changes that Raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses, but otherwise reverted to the Greek Cross plan and other features of Bramante.<ref>Peruzzi's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> This plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both Church and state. In 1527 Rome was sacked and plundered by [[Emperor Charles V]]. Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being realized.<ref name=BF/>\n\nAt this point [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] submitted a plan which combines features of Peruzzi, Raphael and Bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa\u00e7ade and portico of dynamic projection. His proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of Bramante and included ribs on the exterior. Like Bramante, Sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\">Sangallo's plan, {{Harvnb|Fletcher|1996|p=722}}{{clarify |reason=Fletcher 1996 does not have a matching citation in \u00a7References; |date=December 2012}}</ref> Sangallo's main practical contribution was to strengthen Bramante's piers which had begun to crack.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nOn 1 January 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III, Michelangelo, then in his seventies, succeeded Sangallo the Younger as \"Capomaestro\", the superintendent of the building program at St Peter's.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldscheider|1996}}</ref> He is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today, and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through. He did not take on the job with pleasure; it was forced upon him by Pope Paul, frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate, [[Giulio Romano]] and the refusal of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] to leave [[Venice]]. Michelangelo wrote \"I undertake this only for the love of God and in honour of the Apostle.\" He insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit.<ref name=JL-M>{{Harvnb|Lees-Milne|1967}}</ref>\n\n===Michelangelo's contribution===\n[[Michelangelo]] took over a building site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica. He also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the 16th century. There were certain common elements in these schemes. They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] form, like the iconic [[St. Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, or of a [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at [[Florence Cathedral]].\n\nEven though the work had progressed only a little in 40 years, Michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects. He drew on them in developing a grand vision. Above all, Michelangelo recognized the essential quality of Bramante's original design. He reverted to the Greek Cross and, as [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] expresses it: \"Without destroying the centralising features of Bramante's plan, Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive, cohesive unity.\"<ref name=Gardner>{{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005}}</ref>\n\nAs it stands today, St. Peter's has been extended with a nave by [[Carlo Maderno]]. It is the [[chancel]] end (the ecclesiastical \"Eastern end\") with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of Michelangelo. Because of its location within the [[Vatican State]] and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it, the work of Michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance. What becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of Bramante's plan of a square with square projections, and also of Raphael's plan of a square with semi-circular projections.<ref>Michelangelo's plan, {{Harvnb|Gardner|Kleiner|Mamiya|2005|p=458}}</ref> Michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small [[vestry]] or stairwell. The effect created is of a continuous wall-surface that is folded or fractured at different angles, but lacks the right-angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building. This exterior is surrounded by a [[giant order]] of Corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other, in keeping with the ever-changing angles of the wall's surface.

The whole building is as high as it is wide. Its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete, made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice. The inner surface of the dome is deeply [[coffering|coffered]] which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs, while lightening the overall load. At the summit is an ocular opening {{convert|8|m|ft}} across which provides light to the interior.<ref name=BF/>\n\nBramante's plan for the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and like that of the Pantheon, was designed to be constructed in [[Tufa]] [[Concrete]] for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a [[drum (architecture)|drum]] raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The solid wall, as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a [[peristyle]].\n\nIn the case of [[Florence Cathedral]], the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] made its construction feasible.<ref>The dome of Florence Cathedral is depicted in a fresco at [[Santa Maria Novella]] that pre-dates its building by about 100 years.</ref> Its double-shell construction of bricks locked together in herringbone pattern (re-introduced from Byzantine architecture), and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches. While its appearance, with the exception of the details of the lantern, is entirely Gothic, its engineering was highly innovative, and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of Ancient Rome.<ref name=Hartt>{{Harvnb|Hartt|2006}}</ref>\n\nSangallo's plan (1513), of which a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He realized the value of both the coffering at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a [[peristyle]] and surmounted by a spire of conic form.<ref name=\"Fletcher 1996 p=722\"/> According to [[James Lees-Milne]] the design was \"too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success\".<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}<!---Leave this.

The fa\u00e7ade is wide and has a row of huge columns rising from the basement to support the cornice. The ribbed, ovoid dome is surmounted by a lantern topped with ball and cross. Its drum is framed by two very much smaller domes.]]\n[[Michelangelo]] redesigned the dome in 1547, taking into account all that had gone before. His dome, like that of [[Florence]], is constructed of two shells of brick, the outer one having 16 stone ribs, twice the number at Florence but far fewer than in Sangallo's design. As with the designs of Bramante and Sangallo, the dome is raised from the piers on a drum. The encircling peristyle of Bramante and the arcade of Sangallo are reduced to 16 pairs of Corinthian columns, each of {{convert|15|m|ft}} high which stand proud of the building, connected by an arch. Visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs, but structurally they are probably quite redundant. The reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape, rising steeply as does the dome of Florence Cathedral, and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a [[Sphere|hemispherical]] [[dome]], such as that of the Pantheon, which, although it is not buttressed, is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall.<ref name=BF/><ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century. Michelangelo died in 1564, leaving the drum of the dome complete, and Bramante's piers much bulkier than originally designed, each {{convert|18|m|ft}} across. Following his death, the work continued under his assistant [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]] with [[Giorgio Vasari]] appointed by Pope Pius V as a watchdog to make sure that Michelangelo's plans were carried out exactly. Despite Vignola's knowledge of Michelangelo's intentions, little happened in this period. In 1585 the energetic Pope Sixtus appointed [[Giacomo della Porta]] who was to be assisted by [[Domenico Fontana]]. The five-year reign of Sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Caradosso Foppa, View of Saint Peter's (reverse), 1506, NGA 44669.jpg|thumb|upright|1506 medal by [[Cristoforo Foppa]] depicting Bramante's design, including the four flanking smaller domes<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 641] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/641 }}</ref>]]\nMichelangelo left a few drawings, including an early drawing of the dome, and some details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du P\u00e9rac who claimed that they were the master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways.

The profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings, but less so than the finished product. It has been suggested that Michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape. However, Lees-Milne cites Giacomo della Porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to Pope Sixtus that Michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Elevation Showing the Exterior of Saint Peter's Basilica from the South as Conceived by Michelagelo (Published in 1569) MET DT203424.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The engraving by Stefan du P\u00e9rac was published in 1569, five years after the death of Michelangelo |alt=This engraving shows the chancel end of the building much as it was built, except that the dome in this picture is completely semi-circular, not ovoid]]\nHelen Gardner suggests that Michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome. Gardner also comments, \"The sculpturing of architecture [by Michelangelo]&nbsp;... here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome, the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit.\"<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nIt is this sense of the building being sculptured, unified and \"pulled together\" by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led Eneide Mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile, seen now in the end product, was an essential part of Michelangelo's first (and last) concept. The sculptor/architect has, figuratively speaking, taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay. The dome ''must'' appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building's angles and restraining its projections.<ref name=Mignacca/> If this explanation is the correct one, then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution, as perceived by Giacomo della Porta; it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression. In one sense, Michelangelo's dome may appear to look backward to the Gothic profile of Florence Cathedral and ignore the [[Classicism]] of the Renaissance, but on the other hand, perhaps more than any other building of the 16th century, it prefigures the [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the Baroque]].<ref name=Mignacca/>\n\n====Completion====\n[[File:Dome of Saint Peter's Basilica (Interior).jpg|thumb|upright|The dome was brought to completion by Giacomo della Porta and Fontana.|alt= Photo looking up at the dome's interior from below.

His successor, [[Gregory XIV]], saw Fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of Sixtus V placed around its inner opening. The next pope, [[Clement VIII]], had the cross raised into place, an event which took all day, and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city's churches. In the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets, one containing a fragment of the [[True Cross]] and a relic of [[St. Andrew]] and the other containing medallions of the Holy Lamb.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nIn the mid-18th century, cracks appeared in the dome, so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it, like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting. As many as ten chains have been installed at various times, the earliest possibly planned by Michelangelo himself as a precaution, as Brunelleschi did at Florence Cathedral.\n\nAround the inside of the dome is written, in letters {{convert|1.4|m|ft}} high:\n\n{{quote|{{font|{{lang|la|TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM.

The timbers were salvaged for the roof of the [[Borghese Palace]] and two rare black [[marble]] columns, the largest of their kind, were carefully stored and later used in the [[narthex]]. The tombs of various popes were opened, treasures removed and plans made for re-interment in the new basilica.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:StPetersplan OttoLeuger1904.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Michelangelo's plan extended with Maderno's nave and narthex]]\nThe Pope had appointed [[Carlo Maderno]] in 1602. He was a nephew of [[Domenico Fontana]] and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he had been dead for forty years. The ''Fabbrica'' or building [[committee]], a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the [[Curia]] who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the [[Counter-Reformation]] which increasingly associated a [[Greek cross|Greek Cross]] plan with paganism and saw the [[Latin cross|Latin Cross]] as truly symbolic of Christianity.<ref name=JL-M/> The central plan also did not have a \"dominant orientation toward the east.\"<ref name=\"Pile\">{{Harvnb|Pile|2005|p=131}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, [[Vestry|vestries]] and [[Sacristy|sacristies]] had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a [[nave]] that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and a decision was made to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the [[facade]] were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the fa\u00e7ade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the [[stucco]] decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Maderno's facade====\n[[File:0 Basilique Saint-Pierre - Rome (2).JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Maderno's fa\u00e7ade, with the statues of Saint Peter (left) and Saint Paul (right) flanking the entrance stairs|alt=Ornate building in the early morning with a giant order of columns beneath a Latin inscription, fourteen statues on the roofline, and large dome on top.]]\nThe facade designed by Maderno, is {{convert|114.69|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|45.55|m|ft}} high and is built of [[travertine]] stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall [[Attic style|attic]] surmounted by thirteen statues: [[Christ]] flanked by eleven of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] (except [[Saint Peter]], whose statue is left of the stairs) and [[John the Baptist]].\n<ref>[[:File:San Pietro in Vaticano 001.JPG|Another view of the fa\u00e7ade statues]].

The reasons for this, according to James Lees-Milne, are that it was not given enough consideration by the Pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly, coupled with the fact that Maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by Michelangelo at the other end of the building. Lees-Milne describes the problems of the fa\u00e7ade as being too broad for its height, too cramped in its details and too heavy in the [[attic]] story. The breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side. These towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight. One effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome, so that the building, from the front, has no vertical feature, except from a distance.<ref name=JL-M/>\n[[File:San Pietro in Vaticano 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The narthex|alt=Photo shows view of vestibule with three huge doorways leading to the church's interior.

This is the part of Maderno's design with which he was most satisfied. Its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt, and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives, while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza. At each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue, an equestrian figure of [[Charlemagne]] (18th century) by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] in the south end and ''[[The Vision of Constantine (Bernini)|The Vision of Constantine]]'' (1670) by [[Bernini]] in the north end.\n\nFive portals, of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns, lead into the basilica.

The changes that Maderno made to the axis and width can be seen clearly in this picture.]]\nTo the single bay of [[Michelangelo]]'s Greek Cross, Maderno added a further three bays. He made the dimensions slightly different from Michelangelo's bay, thus defining where the two architectural works meet. Maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly. This was not by accident, as suggested by his critics. An ancient [[List of obelisks in Rome|Egyptian obelisk]] had been erected in the square outside, but had not been quite aligned with Michelangelo's building, so Maderno compensated, in order that it should, at least, align with the Basilica's fa\u00e7ade.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nThe nave has huge paired [[pilaster]]s, in keeping with Michelangelo's work. The size of the interior is so \"stupendously large\" that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building.<ref name=JL-M/><ref>The word \"stupendous\" is used by a number of writers trying to adequately describe the enormity of the interior. These include James Lees-Milne and Banister Fletcher.</ref> The four [[cherub]]s who flutter against the first piers of the nave, carrying between them two [[holy water]] basins, appear of quite normal cherubic size, until approached. Then it becomes apparent that each one is over 2 metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies. The aisles each have two smaller [[chapel]]s and a larger rectangular chapel, the Chapel of the Sacrament and the Choir Chapel. These are lavishly decorated with marble, stucco, [[Gilding|gilt]], [[sculpture]] and [[mosaic]]. Remarkably, all of the large altarpieces, with the exception of the Holy Trinity by Pietro da Cortona in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, have been reproduced in mosaic.  Two precious paintings from the old basilica, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Column are still being used as altarpieces. \n\nMaderno's last work at St. Peter's was to design a crypt-like space or \"Confessio\" under the dome, where the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle. Its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its [[Baluster|balustrade]] are 95 bronze lamps.\n\n===Influence on church architecture===\nThe design of St. Peter's Basilica, and in particular its dome, has greatly influenced [[church architecture]] in [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]. Within Rome, the huge domed church of [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] was designed by Giacomo della Porta before the completion of St Peter's Basilica, and subsequently worked on by Carlo Maderno. This was followed by the domes of [[San Carlo ai Catinari]], [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]], and many others. [[Christopher Wren]]'s dome at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] ([[London]], [[England]]), the domes of [[Karlskirche]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]]), [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church]] ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]), and the [[Pantheon, Paris|Pantheon]] ([[Paris]], [[France]]) all pay [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to St Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe 19th and early-20th-century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of St Peter's to a greater or lesser degree, including [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago]], [[St. Josaphat's Basilica]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh]] and [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]] in [[Montreal]], which replicates many aspects of St Peter's on a smaller scale. [[Post-Modernism]] has seen free adaptations of St Peter's in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Liche\u0144]], and the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]].\n\n==Bernini's furnishings==\n[[File:The Chair of Saint Peter adjusted.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|The apse with St. Peter's Cathedra supported by four Doctors of the Church|alt=Pews before the ornate, gold-leafed throne of St. Peter]]\n\n===Pope Urban VIII and Bernini===\nAs a young boy [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598\u20131680) visited St. Peter's with the painter [[Annibale Carracci]] and stated his wish to build \"a mighty throne for the apostle\". His wish came true. As a young man, in 1626, he received the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]] and worked on the embellishment of the Basilica for 50 years. Appointed as Maderno's successor in 1629, he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the [[Baroque]] period. Bernini's works at St. Peter's include the [[baldachin]] (baldaquin, from Italian: ''baldacchino''), the Chapel of the Sacrament, the plan for the niches and [[loggia]]s in the piers of the dome and the [[Chair of Saint Peter|chair of St. Peter]].<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\n====Baldacchino and niches====\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Baldachin}}\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|baldacchino]], a pavilion-like structure {{convert|28.74|m|ft}} tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world, which stands beneath the dome and above the altar. Its design is based on the [[Ciborium (architecture)|''ciborium'']], of which there are many in the churches of Rome, serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the [[Sacrament]]<!-- -Caps needed in this sense- --> is laid for the [[Eucharist]] and emphasizing the significance of this ritual. These ''ciboria'' are generally of white marble, with inlaid coloured stone. Bernini's concept was for something very different. He took his inspiration in part from the [[baldachin]] or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions, and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica. Their twisted [[Solomonic columns|barley-sugar shape]] had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Jerusalem]] and donated by the [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]]. Based on these columns, Bernini created four huge columns of bronze, twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees, which were the emblem of Pope Urban.\n\n[[File:Interiorvaticano8baldaquino.jpg|High altar|thumb|left|The altar with Bernini's baldacchino|alt= Photo shows the baldachin standing in the centre of the church, viewed looking towards the nave. There is an altar beneath it which has a red and gold frontal cloth decorated with large crosses.]]\nThe baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment, like most baldacchini, but with curved Baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy, like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images. In this case, the draped canopy is of bronze, and all the details, including the olive leaves, bees, and the portrait heads of Urban's niece in childbirth and her newborn son, are picked out in gold leaf. The baldacchino stands as a vast free-standing sculptural object, central to and framed by the largest space within the building. It is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it, and the congregation at floor level of the basilica. It is penetrated visually from every direction, and is visually linked to the ''[[Chair of Saint Peter|Cathedra Petri]]'' in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal.<ref name=JL-M/><ref name=Gardner/>\n\nAs part of the scheme for the central space of the church, Bernini had the huge piers, begun by Bramante and completed by Michelangelo, hollowed out into niches, and had staircases made inside them, leading to four [[Balcony|balconies]]. There was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall, but it did not. On the balconies Bernini created showcases, framed by the eight ancient twisted columns, to display the four most precious relics of the basilica: the [[Holy Lance|spear of Longinus]], said to have pierced the side of Christ, the [[veil of Veronica]], with the miraculous image of the face of Christ, a fragment of the [[True Cross]] discovered in [[Jerusalem]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], and a relic of [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], the brother of Saint Peter. In each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above. Only ''Saint Longinus'' is the work of Bernini.<ref name=JL-M/> (See below)\n\n====Bernini's Towers====\n[[File:Cathedrapetri+gloria.jpg|thumb|Bernini's Cathedra Petri and ''Gloria''|alt=The chair-shaped bronze reliquary which holds the throne of St Peter is much larger than a normal chair, is ornate in shape and decorated with relief sculpture and gold leaf. The \"Gloria\" which surrounds a round window is a sculpture of clouds and sun-rays, surrounded by angels, the whole lot being covered in gleaming gold leaf.]]\n\nUrban had long been a critic of Bernini's predecessor, Carlo Maderno. His disapproval of the architect's work stemmed largely from the Maderno's design for the longitudinal nave of St. Peters, which was widely condemned for obscuring Michelangelo's dome. When the Pope gave the commission to Bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade's bell towers to be submitted for consideration. Baldinucci describes Bernini's tower as consisting of \"two orders of columns and pilasters, the first order being [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" and \"a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center\".\n\nUrban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date: 29 June 1641, the feast day dedicated to [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saints Peter and Paul]]. To this end an order was issued which stated that \"all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile.\" The south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues, but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the Pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of Bernini's tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander. The tower continued to grow, and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by Urban's infamous public admonishment of his architect.\n\nIn 1642 all work on both towers came to a halt. Bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition; eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned.\n\n====Cathedra Petri and Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament====\n{{Main article|Chair of Saint Peter}}\nBernini then turned his attention to another precious relic, the so-called ''[[Cathedra Petri]]'' or \"throne of St. Peter\" a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle, but appears to date from the 12th century. As the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable, [[Pope Alexander VII]] determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to Peter was based. Bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed, raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four [[Doctors of the Church]], Saints [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine]] representing the Latin Church and [[Athanasius]] and [[John Chrysostom]], the Greek Church. The four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy. Behind and above the Cathedra, a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow [[alabaster]], illuminating, at its center, the Dove of the Holy Spirit. The elderly painter, [[Andrea Sacchi]], had urged Bernini to make the figures large, so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave. The chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of 16 January 1666.<ref name=\"JL-M\" /><ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nBernini's final work for St. Peter's, undertaken in 1676, was the decoration of the Chapel of the Sacrament.<ref name=\"Basilica Info\">{{cite web|last=Kilby|first=Peter|title=St Peter's Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)|url=http://www.rome.info/vatican/st-peters-basilica/|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> To hold the sacramental Host, he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of Bramante's [[Tempietto]], the little chapel that marks the place of the death of St. Peter. On either side is an angel, one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year.<ref name=JL-M/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==St. Peter's Piazza==\n{{Main article|St. Peter's Square}}\n<!-- -NOTE:This section uses the well-known Italian word \"piazza\" because the English translation to \"square\" is a misnomer.- -->\n[[File:Basilica di San Pietro (notte).jpg|thumb|left|St. Peter's Basilica and the piazza at night|alt=Behind a large monolithic obelisk, the facade of St. Peter's Basilica, lit by floodlights, rising majestically against the night sky]]\nTo the east of the basilica is the ''Piazza di San Pietro'', ([[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]]). The present arrangement, constructed between 1656 and 1667, is the [[Baroque]] inspiration of Bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an Egyptian [[obelisk]] which was centrally placed, (with some contrivance) to Maderno's facade.<ref>The obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis by an unknown pharaoh of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (c. 2494 BC \u2013 2345 BC).</ref> The [[obelisk]], known as \"The Witness\", at {{convert|25.31|m|ft}} and a total height, including base and the cross on top, of {{convert|40|m|ft}}, is the second largest standing obelisk, and the only one to remain standing since its removal from Egypt and re-erection at the [[Circus of Nero]] in 37&nbsp;AD, where it is thought to have stood witness to the [[crucifixion]] of Saint Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Exterior/Obelisk/Obelisk.htm|title=St. Peter's, the Obelisk |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> Its removal to its present location by order of [[Pope Sixtus V]] and engineered by [[Domenico Fontana]] on 28 September 1586, was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction. Fortunately this problem was noticed by Benedetto Bresca, a sailor of [[Sanremo]], and for his swift intervention, his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each [[Palm Sunday]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n[[File:Fountain of Carlo Maderno night.jpg|thumb|One of the two fountains which form the axis of the piazza.|alt=View of one fountain which rises in two tiers from a sculptured pool. The fountain is playing and the water is sparkling.]]\nThe other object in the old square with which Bernini had to contend was a large [[fountain]] designed by Maderno in 1613 and set to one side of the obelisk, making a line parallel with the facade. Bernini's plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique, spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design. The most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain (and a matching companion) could be included, or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] in [[Siena]]. The problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings, including some of the Vatican, and would minimize the effect of the facade. The [[trapezoid]] plan, on the other hand, would maximize the apparent width of the facade, which was already perceived as a fault of the design.<ref name=Gardner/>\n\nBernini's ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than fanning out from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from the second part of the piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its center. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an [[entablature]] of the simple [[Tuscan order|Tuscan Order]].\n\nThe part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it, but reaches out in two arcs, symbolic of the arms of \"the Catholic Church reaching out to welcome its communicants\".<ref name=Gardner/>  The obelisk and Maderno's fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse. Bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in 1675. The approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings, which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade. Nowadays a long wide street, the [[Via della Conciliazione]], built by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaties]], leads from the [[Tiber|River Tiber]] to the [[Town square|piazza]] and gives distant views of St. Peter's as the visitor approaches, with the basilica acting as a [[terminating vista]].<ref name=JL-M/>\n\nBernini's transformation of the site is entirely Baroque in concept. Where Bramante and Michelangelo conceived a building that stood in \"self-sufficient isolation\", Bernini made the whole complex \"expansively relate to its environment\".<ref name=Gardner/> Banister Fletcher says \"No other city has afforded such a wide-swept approach to its cathedral church, no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility&nbsp;... (it is) the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of Christendom.\"<ref name=BF/>\n[[File:St Peter's Square, Vatican City - April 2007.jpg|upright=2.25|thumb|centre|View of Rome from the Dome of St. Peter's Basilica|alt=At the front of the view are the backs of thirteen large statues that stand in along the edge of the fa\u00e7ade. Beyond them can be seen the piazza which is in three parts. The nearest appears square, while the second widens into an oval surrounded on each side by the huge grey columns on the colonnade, and with the obelisk at its centre. Beyond that is a further square surrounded by pale pink buildings. A wide street leads from the square, at the end of which can be seen the river, a bridge and castle.]]\n\n== Clock ==\nThe top of the facade of St. Peter's Basilica has two clocks and several sculptures. The clocks were created to replace Bernini's bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support. The left clock shows Rome time, the one of the right shows [[European mean time]]. The statues are Christ the Redeemer, St. John the Baptist and 11 Apostles. From the left: St. Thadeus, St. Matthew, St. Philip, St. Thomas, St. James the Greater, St. John the Baptist, The Redeemer, St. Andrew, St. John the Evangelist, St. James the Lesser, St. Bartholomew, St. Simeon, and St. Matthias. Above the roman clock is the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|coat of arms for the city-state of Vatican City]] since 1931 held by two angels. The European mean time clock only shows an hour hand and it is about half an hour behind the rome time. The European mean time also be an attempt to keep the Devil guessing about \"the day and the hour.\"  \n\n== Bells ==\nThe Basilica has 6 bells, placed in the room under the roman clock, only 3 of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]]. They range from the smallest which is 260 kg to the massive [[Bourdon (bell)|bourdon]] that approximately weighs 9 tonnes. From 1931, the bells are operated electrically, thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance. The oldest bell '''Rota''' dates from 1288 and the bourdon called '''Campanone''' is rung at Christmas and Easter, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, and every time the Pope imparts the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to the city and to the world. Campanone also announces the election of a new pope.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Bell#\n!Name\n!Mass \n!Casted\n|-\n|1\n|Campanella\n|260 kg\n|1825\n|-\n|2\n|Ave Maria \n|280 kg\n|1932\n|-\n|3\n|Predica\n|850 kg\n|1893\n|-\n|4\n|Rota\n|2 t\n|1288\n|-\n|5\n|Campanoncino (Mezzana, Benedittina)\n|4 t\n|1725\n|-\n|6\n|Campanone\n|9 t\n|1785\n|}\n\n==Treasures==\n[[File:Crypt air vent.jpg|thumb|[[Air vent]]s for the crypt in St. Peter's Basilica|alt=White and orange marble rings a circular, decorated bronze vent]]\n\n===Tombs and relics===\n{{Main article|List of papal tombs}}\nThere are over 100 [[tomb]]s within St. Peter's Basilica (extant to various extents), many located beneath the Basilica. These include 91 popes, Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto II]], and the composer [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]. Exiled Catholic British royalty [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] and his two sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, are buried here, having been granted asylum by [[Pope Clement XI]]. Also buried here are [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]], wife of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated her throne in order to convert to [[Catholicism]], and [[Countess]] [[Matilda of Tuscany]], supporter of the Papacy during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. The most recent interment was [[Pope John Paul II]], on 8 April 2005. Beneath, near the [[crypt]], is the recently discovered vaulted 4th-century \"[[Tomb of the Julii]]\". (See below for some descriptions of tombs).\n\n===Artworks===\n====The towers and narthex====\n* In the towers to either side of the facade are two clocks. The clock on the left has been operated electrically since 1931. Its oldest bell dates from 1288.\n* One of the most important treasures of the basilica is a mosaic set above the central external door. Called the \"Navicella\", it is based on a design by [[Giotto]] (early 14th century) and represents a ship symbolizing the Christian Church.<ref name=Pinto/> The mosaic is mostly a 17th-century copy of Giotto's original.\n* At each end of the narthex is an equestrian figure, to the north [[Constantine the Great]] by Bernini (1670) and to the south [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini|Cornacchini]] (18th century).<ref name=Pinto/>\n* Of the five portals from the narthex to the interior, three contain notable doors. The central portal has the Renaissance bronze door by [[Antonio di Pietro Averlino|Antonio Averulino]] (called Filarete) (1455), enlarged to fit the new space. The southern door, the ''[[Door of the Dead in St. Peter's Basilica|Door of the Dead]]'', was designed by 20th-century sculptor [[Giacomo Manz\u00f9]] and includes a portrait of Pope John XXIII kneeling before the crucified figure of Saint Peter.\n* The northernmost door is the \"Holy Door\" which, by tradition, is walled-up with bricks, and opened only for holy years such as the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee year]] by the Pope. The present door is bronze and was designed by [[Vico Consorti]] in 1950 and cast in [[Florence]] by the [[Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry]].

One foot of the statue is largely worn away by [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] kissing it for centuries.\n* The sunken Confessio leading to the Vatican [[Grotto]]es (see above) contained a large kneeling statue by [[Canova]] of [[Pope Pius VI]], who was captured and mistreated by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] army.  This has now been moved to the back (eastern) end of the grottoes.\n* In the Confessio is the ''Niche of the Pallium'' (\"Niche of Stoles\") which contains a bronze urn, donated by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to contain white stoles embroidered with black crosses and woven with the wool of lambs blessed on St. Agnes' day.\n* The High [[Altar]] is surmounted by Bernini's [[baldachin]]. (See above)\n* Set in niches within the four piers supporting the dome are the larger-than-life statues associated with the basilica's primary holy relics: [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] holding the [[True Cross]] and the [[Nail (relic)|Holy Nails]], by [[Andrea Bolgi]]; [[Saint Longinus]] holding the [[Holy Lance|spear that pierced the side of Jesus]], by Bernini (1639); [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] with the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], by [[Francois Duquesnoy]] and [[Saint Veronica]] holding her [[Veil of Veronica|veil with the image of Jesus' face]], by [[Francesco Mochi]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"150px\">\nFile:Saint Helena.jpg|alt= A marble statue showing a matronly woman in a sweeping cloak supporting a cross which stands beside her and presenting a set of nails to the viewer with her left hand|''Saint Helena''<br>by Andrea Bolgi\nFile:Saint Longinus.jpg|alt= This statue shows a Roman soldier, with a cloak furling around him, gazing upward while he supports a long spear with his right hand and throws out his other hand in amazement.|''Saint Longinus''<br>by Bernini\nFile:Saint Andreas.jpg|alt= This statue shows an elderly man, bare-chested, and draped, looking up despairingly as he supports a large cross, arranged diagonally.|''Saint Andrew''<br>by Francois Duquesnoy\nFile:Saint veronica.jpg|alt= This statue shows the saint as a young woman, who, with a sweeping dramatic gesture, displays a cloth on which there is an image of the face of Jesus.|''Saint Veronica''<br>by Francesco Mochi\n</gallery>\n\n====North aisle====\n* In the first chapel of the north aisle is [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]''.<ref>The statue was damaged in 1972 by Lazlo Toft, a Hungarian-Australian, who considered that the veneration shown to the statue was idolatrous. The damage was repaired and the statue subsequently placed behind glass.</ref>\n* On the first pier in the right aisle is the monument of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], who abdicated in 1654 in order to convert to Catholicism.\n* The second chapel, dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian]], contains the statues of popes [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]. The space below the altar used to be the resting place of [[Pope Innocent XI]] but his remains were moved to the ''Altar of the Transfiguration'' on 8 April 2011. This was done to make way for the body of [[Pope John Paul II]]. His remains were placed beneath the altar on 2 May 2011.\n* The large chapel on the right aisle is the ''Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament'' which contains the tabernacle by Bernini (1664) resembling [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' at [[San Pietro in Montorio]] supported by two kneeling angels and with behind it a painting of the [[Holy Trinity]] by [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n* Near the altar of ''Our Lady of Succour'' are the monuments of popes [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]] by [[Camillo Rusconi]] (1723) and [[Pope Gregory XIV|Gregory XIV]].\n* At the end of the aisle is an altar containing the relics of [[Saint Petronilla]] and with an altarpiece ''The Burial of St Petronilla'' by [[Guercino]] (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), 1623.\n\n====South aisle====\n* The first chapel in the south aisle is the baptistry, commissioned by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and designed by [[Carlo Fontana]], (great nephew of Domenico Fontana). The font, which was previously located in the opposite chapel, is the red [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]] of Probus, the 4th-century [[Prefect]] of Rome. The lid came from a different [[sarcophagus]], which had once held the remains of the Emperor [[Hadrian]] and in removing it from the Vatican Grotto where it had been stored, the workmen broke it into ten pieces. Fontana restored it expertly and surmounted it with a gilt-bronze figure of the \"[[Lamb of God]]\".\n* Against the first pier of the aisle is the [[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]], James and his sons, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles Edward]], known as \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" and [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry, Cardinal and Duke of York]]. The tomb is a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] design by [[Canova]] unveiled in 1819. Opposite it is the memorial of James Francis Edward Stuart's wife, [[Maria Klementyna Sobieska|Maria Clementina Sobieska]].\n* The second chapel is that of the ''Presentation of the Virgin'' and contains the memorials of [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].\n* Against the piers are the tombs of [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]].\n* The large chapel off the south aisle is the ''Choir Chapel'' which contains the altar of the ''[[Immaculate Conception]]''.\n* At the entrance to the [[Sacristy]] is the tomb of [[Pope Pius VIII]]\n* The south transept contains the altars of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint Joseph]] and the ''Crucifixion of [[Saint Peter]]''.\n* The tomb of Fabio Chigi, [[Pope Alexander VII]], towards the end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne \"one of the greatest tombs of the [[Baroque]] Age\". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]] and [[Truth]]. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant [[England]]. Coming forth, seemingly, from the doorway as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of [[Death]],<!-- -NOTE: Death requires a capital letter in this sense.- --> its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an [[hourglass]] stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.<ref name=JL-M/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220px\" widths=\"170px\">\nFile:Rome basilica st peter 004 adjusted.JPG|alt= A pair of bronze doors divided into sixteen panels containing reliefs depicting scenes mainly from the life of Jesus and stories that he told.|The Holy Door is opened only for great celebrations.\nFile:0 Monument fun\u00e9raire du pape Alexandre VII - St-Pierre - Vatican (1).jpg|alt= A large memorial set in a niche.

''Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril'' is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated as: \"On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.\" In this case, \"bril\" (\"glasses\" in Dutch) serves as a homonym for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference.<ref name=\"Hoax\" /> On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to \"see the Lions washed\".<ref name=\"Hoax\" />\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian is known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

It is a day when many pranks are played: hoaxes \u2013 sometimes very sophisticated \u2013 are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1 can be untrue. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools\u2019 Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n=\n\n=== April fish ===\nIn Italy, France, Belgium and French-speaking areas of Switzerland and Canada, April 1 tradition is often known as \"April fish\" (''poisson d'avril'' in French, ''april vis'' in Dutch or ''pesce d'aprile'' in Italian). This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s.

In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"''Inocente palomita que te dejaste enga\u00f1ar''\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of ''palomita'', which means \u201cpopcorn\u201d in some dialects).\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is, \u201c''\u00a1Inocente para siempre!\u201d'' which means \"Innocent forever!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the prankster's says, \u201c''\u00a1Que la inocencia te valga!\u201d'' which roughly translates as advice to not be as gullible as the victim of the prank.

''Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril'' is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated as: \"On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.\" In this case, \"bril\" (\"glasses\" in Dutch) serves as a homonym for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference.<ref name=\"Hoax\" /> On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to \"see the Lions washed\".<ref name=\"Hoax\" />\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian is known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

It is a day when many pranks are played: hoaxes \u2013 sometimes very sophisticated \u2013 are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1 can be untrue. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools\u2019 Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (''aprilsnar'' in Danish; ''aprillip\u00e4iv\u00e4'' in Finnish; ''aprilsk\u00e4mt'' in Swedish).

Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s.

In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"''Inocente palomita que te dejaste enga\u00f1ar''\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of ''palomita'', which means \u201cpopcorn\u201d in some dialects).\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is, \u201c''\u00a1Inocente para siempre!\u201d'' which means \"Innocent forever!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the prankster's says, \u201c''\u00a1Que la inocencia te valga!\u201d'' which roughly translates as advice to not be as gullible as the victim of the prank.

The 1990s [[sitcom]] ''[[Roseanne]]'' featured an episode titled \"April Fools' Day\". This turned out to be intentionally misleading, as the episode was about Tax Day in the United States on April 15&nbsp;\u2013 the last day to submit the previous year's tax information.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Comedy}}\n* [[List of April Fools' Day jokes]]\n* [[List of practical joke topics]]\n* [[Veneralia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Wainwright, Martin (2007).
