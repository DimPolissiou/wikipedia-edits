{"title_page": "List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of [[Nobel Prize]]s, because they are either not among the prizes established as part of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will nor, in the case of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], sponsored afterwards by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with the year when a prize was awarded for the first time in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with the year when a prize was awarded for the first time in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli

He was national champion in 1946.<ref name=\"lequipe\"/>\n\n==Career==\nCaput rode as a professional from 1942 to 1957. [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] said:\n\n:Everybody liked Louis Caput, who became known to the crowds as ''P'tit Louis''. And not only was Caput a likeable rider, he was a clever one who knew his job perfectly and I don't think I have ever seen him make a serious mistake on the road. Whenever he got into a break, he was the boss, the ruler of it. Little Louis was a great general of the [[peloton]]s, shouting encouragement, picking the right length for the relays and giving orders to his companions of the breakaway.<ref>Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting</ref>\n\nHe rode the Tour de France nine times between 1947 and 1956, failing to finish six times but coming 45th in 1951, 54th in 1955 and 56th in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ledicodutour.com/coureurs/coureurs_c/caput.htm|title=Louis Caput dans le Tour de France|website=www.ledicodutour.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> He won stages in 1949 and 1955.

In 1966 he became [[directeur sportif]] of a new team, Kamom\u00e9-Dilecta,<ref>It seems unusual that a Japanese company would have an accent in its name but that is how it was printed on the jerseys: http://www.mairie-tourlaville.fr/fr/tourisme/tourisme_et_patrimoine/dossiers_en_consultation/fichiers/lebreton.PDF</ref> sponsored by a maker of Japanese washing machines and a French bicycle company that had last had a team in the 1930s.

Kamom\u00e9 was in financial difficulties,\" said one of the riders, Raymond Lebreton.\n\nThe French businessman, [[Jean de Gribaldy]], took over sponsorship the following year with Frimatic, another maker of washing machines, as main backer. Caput went with him to run the team but, said, Lebreton, his organisation was chaotic. \"The de Gribaldy team was badly organised. We were told we were to ride raced only a few hours before they started. It was a bazaar, and I wanted to leave.\"<ref name=\"mairie\"/> Caput ran the team from 1968 to 1969.

A large clinical problem was women with chronic pelvic pain. Together with another physiotherapist, Tove Boe, she developed a new group treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain with focus on a psychosomatic approach. Combining qualitative actions research methods with quantitative measurements of improvements, the results showed that the patients improved significantly. This research was published in her Master's thesis and a scientific paper.<ref>'''Albert H.''' Psychosomatic group treatment helps women with chronic pelvic pain. J Psychosom Obstret Gynecol 1999;20:216-25</ref>\n\nThe large number of pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the obstetric department. Little was known about the diagnosis and treatment of this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain.  Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Girdle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>Albert HB.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs. Hanne Albert was the first to describe this connection between a previous herniation and new Modic changes in the adjacent vertebra. For this research she was awarded a price and these results were published as a scientific paper.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Manniche | first2 = C | year = 2007 | title = Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 977\u201382 }}</ref> This was unknown news and led her together with radiologist, Joan Solg\u00e5rd S\u00f8rensen, to develop three theories of the pathogenesis behind Modic changes; a bacterial cause, a mechanical cause and a rheumatological cause. This theory was published in 2007.<ref>Albert HB, Kjaer P, Jensen TS, Sorensen JS, Bendix T, Manniche C \"Modic changes, possible causes and relation to low back pain. ''Med Hypotheses.'' 2008;70:361-8. </ref>\n\n===Bacteria as a cause of back pain===\nThe new idea that was presented was, that through a lesion in the herniated disc the bacteria Propioni Acnes could invade the disc, and that Modic changes/bone edema was the edema surrounding the infected disc. Antibiotic treatment was a relevant treatment of an infection. The first study of antibiotic treatment of Modic changes ever, was published in 2008. Here 32 patients in a pilot study was treated with long term antibiotic and 60% of these became much better or cured for their back pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 2013, the first randomized clinically controlled trial (RCT) was published.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This study which has received the highest grade in methodology, showed in 162 patients a highly significant and clinically relevant improvement in the patients that received the antibiotic treatment and no change in the patients that received the placebo tablets. This naturally stirred massive international interest.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/07/antibiotics-cure-back-pain-patients \"Antibiotics could cure 40% of chronic back pain patients\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tuesday 7 May 2013.

A large clinical problem was women with chronic pelvic pain. Together with another physiotherapist, Tove Boe, she developed a new group treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain with focus on a psychosomatic approach. Combining qualitative actions research methods with quantitative measurements of improvements, the results showed that the patients improved significantly. This research was published in her Master's thesis and a scientific paper.<ref>'''Albert H.''' Psychosomatic group treatment helps women with chronic pelvic pain. J Psychosom Obstret Gynecol 1999;20:216-25</ref>\n\nThe large number of pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the obstetric department. Little was known about the diagnosis and treatment of this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain.  Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Girdle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>Albert HB.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs. Hanne Albert was the first to describe this connection between a previous herniation and new Modic changes in the adjacent vertebra. For this research she was awarded a price and these results were published as a scientific paper.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Manniche | first2 = C | year = 2007 | title = Modic changes following lumbar disc herniation | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 977\u201382 }}</ref> This was unknown news and led her together with radiologist, Joan Solg\u00e5rd S\u00f8rensen, to develop three theories of the pathogenesis behind Modic changes; a bacterial cause, a mechanical cause and a rheumatological cause. This theory was published in 2007.<ref>'''Albert HB''', Kjaer P, Jensen TS, Sorensen JS, Bendix T, Manniche C \"Modic changes, possible causes and relation to low back pain. Med Hypotheses. 2008;70:361-8. </ref>\n\n===Bacteria as a cause of back pain===\nThe new idea that was presented was, that through a lesion in the herniated disc the bacteria Propioni Acnes could invade the disc, and that Modic changes/bone edema was the edema surrounding the infected disc. Antibiotic treatment was a relevant treatment of an infection. The first study of antibiotic treatment of Modic changes ever, was published in 2008. Here 32 patients in a pilot study was treated with long term antibiotic and 60% of these became much better or cured for their back pain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In 2013, the first randomized clinically controlled trial (RCT) was published.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This study which has received the highest grade in methodology, showed in 162 patients a highly significant and clinically relevant improvement in the patients that received the antibiotic treatment and no change in the patients that received the placebo tablets. This naturally stirred massive international interest.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/07/antibiotics-cure-back-pain-patients \"Antibiotics could cure 40% of chronic back pain patients\"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', Tuesday 7 May 2013.

The song's lyrics were co-written by all four members of the band and address the [[Opioid epidemic|prescription drug abuse epidemic]] occurring in North America. It was produced by [[Martin Terefe]] and recorded at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios in London. Along with the group's usual [[hard rock]] sound, the song uses elements of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Country music|country]] music genres. The band's transition into the pop genre has been associated with lead singer [[Tyler Connolly]]'s newly acquired piano-playing ability, which forced a change in his songwriting style.\n\n\"Rx (Medicate)\" was released alongside its music video on July 27, 2017, as the [[lead single]] from ''Wake Up Call'' and served as an [[Music download|instant download]] on pre-orders of the album. It received mixed reviews from music critics and was praised for being socially aware but criticized for aspects of its music and lyrics. The single became Theory of a Deadman's third single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' U.S. [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, and was certified platinum by [[Music Canada]] and gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. It earned the band a No. 1 Song Award from the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] (SOCAN) and was nominated for \"Rock Song of the Year\" at the [[2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards]].\n\nTheory of a Deadman partnered with Shatterproof, a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on education about [[Substance dependence|alcohol and drug dependence]], helping addicts' families, and reducing the stigma associated with drug abuse. At live concerts, the band encourage their audience to seek help if they are battling addiction and invite their fans to share their personal stories. They also sell lapel pins bearing the song's title to benefit Shatterproof at their concerts.\n\n==Recording and release==\n\"Rx (Medicate)\" was co-written by all four members of [[Theory of a Deadman]] and was produced by [[Martin Terefe]].<ref name=\"SOCAN\">{{cite web|url=https://www.socanmagazine.ca/news/theory-of-a-deadman-earn-socan-no-1-song-award-for-rx-medicate/|title=Theory of a Deadman Earn SOCAN No. 1 Song Award for \"Rx (Medicate)\"|last=Druckman|first=Howard|publisher=[[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]]|date=November 16, 2017|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Vents\">{{cite web|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/2017/09/08/theory-deadman-share-new-track-echoes/|title=Theory of a Deadman Share New Track \"Echoes\"|last=Frometa|first=RJ|date=September 8, 2017|website=Vents Magazine|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> ''[[Wake Up Call (Theory of a Deadman album)|Wake Up Call]]'' is the first album on which the band collaborated with Terefe rather than [[Howard Benson]], who produced their previous four albums.<ref name=\"SurreyNow-Leader\">{{cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/entertainment/rx-medicate-the-biggest-song-of-theory-of-a-deadmans-16-year-career-north-delta-bassist-raves/|title='Rx (Medicate)' the biggest song of Theory of a Deadman's 16-year career, North Delta bassist raves|last=Zillich|first=Tom|website=Surrey Now-Leader|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}</ref> The song was recorded at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios in London and was mixed by [[Oskar Winberg]], while engineering was done by George Murphy and Bobby Shin.<ref name=\"WakeUpCallLiner\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Wake Up Call|title-link=Wake Up Call (Theory of a Deadman album)|others=[[Theory of a Deadman]]|year=2017|type=Liner notes|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]], [[Atlantic Records]]}}</ref><ref name=\"AllMusicRxCredits\">{{cite web|title=Rx (Medicate) \u2013 Theory of a Deadman \u2013 Credits|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rx-medicate-mw0003120752/credits|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe single was released alongside its [[music video]] on July 27, 2017; the same day, Theory of a Deadman announced the name of their pending album.

At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.\n\n: <math>x+n+a = \\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\sqrt{\\cdots}}}</math>\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,\n# {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,\n# the denominator of {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,\n# {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1){{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1)''B<sub>n</sub>''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.\n\nIn his 17-page paper \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|91}} His writing initially had many flaws.

He lasted only a few weeks.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.</ref> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSir,<br>\n{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances.

I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from [[E.

Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S.

W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability\", he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.<ref>Letter from M.

Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.</ref> Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he gave thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nThe first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|170\u2013171}} On 16 January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]].

Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers\u2013Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy said the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\",<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} and that they \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.

In one instance Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, \"The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University.\" Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}</ref> In his quarterly papers Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|183}}\n\nHardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; Neville said, \"Ramanujan needed no converting\" and \"his parents' opposition had been withdrawn\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Apparently Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her \"to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose\".<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.\n\n==Life in England==\n[[File:RamanujanCambridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ramanujan (centre) and his colleague [[G.

Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G.

Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration\u2014a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917 Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.

His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in 1914\u201318. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency, and confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and in 1920 he died at the age of 32. After his death his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions.<ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nRamanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950 she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C.

Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most intriguing of these formulae include infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt 2}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.</math>\n\nThis result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = \u22124 \u00d7 58 = \u2212232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 \u00d7 9801 = 396<sup>2</sup>}}, which is related to the fact that\n\n:<math display=\"inline\"> e^{\\pi\\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\\dots. </math>\n\nThis might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan\u2013Sato series]].\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:\n\n{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&pg=PA185&dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref>}}\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left ( 1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} + \\left (1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cosh(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac {2 \\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac34 \\right )} \\pi = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{\\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac14 \\right )}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|\u0393(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]].

They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. In 1937 [[Hans Rademacher]] refined their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method|circle method]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].\n\n===The Ramanujan conjecture===\n{{Main|Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjecture}}\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' one was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form \u0394(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.<ref name=ono/>\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function, whose coefficients are called {{math|''\u03c4''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= 9 |year= 1916 |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194\u2013197.</ref> He proved many congruences for these numbers, such as {{math|''\u03c4''(''p'') \u2261 1 + ''p''<sup>11</sup> mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of [[Galois module|Galois representations]] that \"explains\" these congruences and more generally all modular forms. {{math|\u0394(''z'')}} is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations.

They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his work to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\">{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0387949413 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks|last1 = Berndt|first1 = Bruce C.|date = 12 December 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, and the third 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself wrote papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\"/> in 1976 [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] rediscovered a fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|\"lost notebook\"]].<ref name=\"lostnotebook\"/>\n\n==Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number 1729==\n{{Main|1729 (number)}}\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.

It is perhaps useless to speculate as to his history had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six. It is not extravagant to suppose that he might have become the greatest mathematician of his time. What he actually did is wonderful enough...when the researches which his work has suggested have been completed, it will probably seem a good deal more wonderful than it does to-day.<ref name=\"Hardy1920\"/>}}\n\nHardy further said:\n\n{{quote|He combined a power of generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out [[modular equation]]s and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a [[doubly periodic function]] or of [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy's theorem]], and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a [[complex variable]] was...\".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |title = Ramanujan quote |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610103616/https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |archivedate = 10 June 2007 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said they were \"arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account.\"<ref name=\"cola1\">[https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html Srinivasa Ramanujan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325041218/https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html |date=25 March 2005 }}.

V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity.

Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.''<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|86}}\n\nOne of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:\n\n: <math>\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3 \\sqrt{1+\\cdots}}}.</math>\n\nHe waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.\n\n: <math>x+n+a = \\sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \\sqrt{\\cdots}}}</math>\n\nUsing this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:\n\nIt will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,\n# {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,\n# the denominator of {{mvar|B<sub>n</sub>}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,\n# {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1){{sfrac|''B<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1)''B<sub>n</sub>''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.\n\nIn his 17-page paper \"Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers\" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|91}} His writing initially had many flaws. As ''Journal'' editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:\n<blockquote>\nMr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seshu Iyer |first=P.

Ramanujan, B.A., F.R.S.|journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society|volume=12 |issue=3 |page=83|ref=harv }}</ref></blockquote>\nRamanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the ''Journal''.<ref name=\"Neville293\"/> In early 1912 he got a temporary job in the Madras [[Accountant General]]'s office, with a monthly salary of 20 rupees. He lasted only a few weeks.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 176.</ref> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.\n\nIn a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSir,<br>\n{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 31.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAttached to his application was a recommendation from [[E. W. Middlemast]], a mathematics professor at the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], who wrote that Ramanujan was \"a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics\".<ref>Srinivasan (1968), p. 49.</ref> Three weeks after he applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|96}} At his office Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given and spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.\n\n===Contacting British mathematicians===\nIn the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and [[E. W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had \"a taste for mathematics, and some ability\", he lacked the necessary educational background and foundation to be accepted by mathematicians.<ref>Letter from M. J. M. Hill to a C. L. T. Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.</ref> Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he gave thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nThe first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|170\u2013171}} On 16 January 1913 Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]].

Hardy found these results \"much more intriguing\" than Gauss's work on integrals.<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers\u2013Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy said the theorems \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\",<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} and that they \"must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them\".<ref name=\"Kanigel1991\" />{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J.

Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, \"Does Ramanujan know Polish?\" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}</ref> In his quarterly papers Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable.

Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration\u2014a conflict that neither found easy.\n\nRamanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917 Ramanujan was elected to the London Mathematical Society.

His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in 1914\u201318. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency, and confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and in 1920 he died at the age of 32. After his death his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions.<ref name=\"express\"/>\n\nRamanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950 she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C.

Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most intriguing of these formulae include infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\pi} = \\frac{2\\sqrt 2}{9801} \\sum^\\infty_{k=0} \\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.</math>\n\nThis result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = \u22124 \u00d7 58 = \u2212232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 \u00d7 9801 = 396<sup>2</sup>}}, which is related to the fact that\n\n:<math display=\"inline\"> e^{\\pi\\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\\dots. </math>\n\nThis might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.\n\nRamanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan\u2013Sato series]].\n\nOne of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:\n\n{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&pg=PA185&dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref>}}\n\nHis intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\left ( 1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} + \\left (1+2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cosh(n\\theta)}{\\cosh(n\\pi)} \\right )^{-2} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac {2 \\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac34 \\right )} \\pi = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{\\Gamma^4 \\left ( \\frac14 \\right )}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|\u0393(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]].

They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. In 1937 [[Hans Rademacher]] refined their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method|circle method]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].\n\n===The Ramanujan conjecture===\n{{Main|Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjecture}}\n\nAlthough there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' one was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form \u0394(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.<ref name=ono/>\n\nIn his paper \"On certain arithmetical functions\", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function, whose coefficients are called {{math|''\u03c4''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= 9 |year= 1916 |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194\u2013197.</ref> He proved many congruences for these numbers, such as {{math|''\u03c4''(''p'') \u2261 1 + ''p''<sup>11</sup> mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}.

Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Ono |first1= Ken |authorlink1= Ken Ono |last2= Aczel|first2= Amir D. |authorlink2= Amir Aczel |title= My Search for Ramanujan: How I Learned to Count |date= 13 April 2016 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages= 236\u2013237 |isbn= 978-3319255668 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JZkFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq=%22ideas+that+were+critical+to+the+proof+of+Fermat's+last+theorem%22#v=onepage&q=%22ideas%20that%20were%20critical%20to%20the%20proof%20of%20Fermat's%20last%20theorem%22&f=false |quote= ideas that were critical to the proof of Fermat's last theorem}}</ref>\n\n===Ramanujan's notebooks===\n{{Further|Ramanujan's lost notebook}}\n\nWhile still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of [[loose leaf|looseleaf]] paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.\n\nThis may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his work to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\">{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0387949413 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks|last1 = Berndt|first1 = Bruce C.|date = 12 December 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, and the third 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself wrote papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.<ref name=\"Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan\"/> in 1976 [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]] rediscovered a fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|\"lost notebook\"]].<ref name=\"lostnotebook\"/>\n\n==Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number 1729==\n{{Main|1729 (number)}}\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital.

It is perhaps useless to speculate as to his history had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six.
